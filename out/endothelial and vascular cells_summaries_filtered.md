Disease focus: Aging and Parkinson’s disease (PD) in human midbrain (substantia nigra)
</metadata>

<methods>
Paired single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) and ATAC-seq (chromatin accessibility) were performed on postmortem human substantia nigra from young (mean 24y), aged (mean 75y), and PD (mean 81y) donors. Multiomic analysis enabled direct inference of cis-regulatory elements and gene expression in the same nuclei. Cell types were annotated by canonical markers; endothelial cells (ECs) and vascular cells were identified by FLT1, VWF, and PDGFRB expression. Cell type proportions, gene expression, and chromatin accessibility were compared across age and disease. Peak–gene associations and GWAS SNP enrichment were analyzed.
</methods>

<Quick Reference>
This study provides a comprehensive single-nucleus multiomic atlas of the human midbrain across aging and Parkinson’s disease, including endothelial and vascular cells. Endothelial cells (ECs) were identified by FLT1, VWF, and PDGFRB, but comprised a minor fraction of nuclei (~0.2–0.4%). No significant age- or PD-associated changes in EC proportion, gene expression, or chromatin accessibility were detected. However, cell-type-specific chromatin peaks in ECs overlapped with PD GWAS SNPs, suggesting potential regulatory relevance, though functional consequences remain unclear. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</Quick Reference>

<Detailed Summary>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Identification**  
Endothelial and vascular cells (ECs) were robustly identified in the multiomic dataset by high expression of FLT1, VWF, and PDGFRB, and by corresponding chromatin accessibility at these loci. ECs represented a small proportion of total nuclei: 0.2% in young, 0.4% in aged, and 0.3% in PD samples (Fig. 1f). No statistically significant differences in EC abundance were observed between young, aged, and PD groups. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> This suggests that, at least at the level of cell number, ECs are not selectively lost or expanded in aging or PD in the midbrain.

**Differential Gene Expression and Subtype Analysis**  
The study did not report further subclustering or functional heterogeneity within the EC population. No distinct EC subtypes or disease-associated EC states were described. Differential gene expression analysis between young, aged, and PD groups did not identify significant changes in EC marker genes or other EC-enriched transcripts. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> The lack of EC-specific DEGs suggests that the transcriptional profile of midbrain ECs is relatively stable across aging and PD.

**Chromatin Accessibility and Regulatory Landscape**  
Chromatin accessibility at EC marker loci (FLT1, VWF, PDGFRB) was high and specific to the EC cluster (Fig. 1e). However, as with gene expression, there were no significant differences in chromatin accessibility at these or other loci in ECs between young, aged, and PD samples. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> This stability was consistent with the broader finding that chromatin accessibility changes little within a given cell type over aging or PD, even when gene expression changes are observed in other cell types.

**Peak–Gene Associations and GWAS SNP Enrichment**  
The study performed peak–gene association analysis to link chromatin peaks to gene expression in cis. While most of the focus was on glial cell types, EC-specific peaks were included in the analysis of PD GWAS SNP enrichment. Several PD-associated SNPs were found within EC-specific accessible chromatin regions (Fig. 3c, 3e), though the majority of such SNPs were more enriched in neurons and oligodendrocytes. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> The functional impact of these EC SNPs remains undetermined, as the study did not report altered peak–gene associations or expression of nearby genes in ECs.

**Pathway Enrichment and Functional Implications**  
No EC-specific pathway enrichment or functional shifts were reported. The study’s pathway analyses (e.g., unfolded protein response, chaperone-mediated autophagy, myelination) were focused on glial populations, with no mention of vascular or endothelial-specific processes.

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**  
No spatial transcriptomics, immunostaining, or morphological validation of ECs or their subtypes was performed or reported.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**  
Pseudotime and combined pseudopathogenesis trajectory analyses were not applied to ECs, likely due to their low abundance and lack of transcriptional heterogeneity.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**  
Although EC-specific peaks overlapped with PD GWAS SNPs, no eQTL or direct genotype-expression associations were reported for ECs. The study notes that the regulatory landscape of PD risk variants may be cell-type-specific, but functional links in ECs remain speculative.

<keyFinding priority='2'>The main finding for endothelial and vascular cells is their numerical and transcriptional stability across aging and PD, with some overlap between EC-specific chromatin peaks and PD GWAS SNPs, but no evidence for disease-associated EC subtypes or functional shifts.</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
The data suggest that, in the human midbrain, endothelial and vascular cells do not undergo major changes in abundance, gene expression, or chromatin accessibility during aging or Parkinson’s disease. While EC-specific chromatin regions harbor some PD-associated genetic variants, the lack of transcriptional or epigenetic shifts implies that ECs are unlikely to be primary drivers of midbrain pathology in PD. However, the presence of risk SNPs in EC regulatory regions raises the possibility of subtle, context-dependent effects not captured in this cross-sectional study. No therapeutic or biomarker implications for ECs are proposed. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</clinical>

<Research Implications>
This study provides a high-confidence negative result for endothelial and vascular cells in the context of midbrain aging and Parkinson’s disease: ECs are numerically and transcriptionally stable, with no evidence for disease-associated subtypes or activation states. This contrasts with the marked changes observed in glial populations (especially oligodendrocytes and microglia). The overlap of EC-specific chromatin peaks with PD GWAS SNPs is intriguing but not functionally resolved; future studies could investigate whether these variants affect EC function under stress or in other brain regions. The lack of EC heterogeneity or activation in this dataset may reflect true biological stability, low sensitivity due to small cell numbers, or region-specific effects. The findings align with prior single-cell studies that have not highlighted ECs as major players in PD, but the multiomic approach here strengthens the confidence in this conclusion. Open questions remain regarding the role of vascular dysfunction in PD in other brain regions or at earlier disease stages, and whether rare EC subtypes might emerge under different pathological contexts. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**  
Endothelial and vascular cells were identified as a rare, discrete cluster in snRNA-seq of human cingulate cortex in Huntington disease and controls, but showed no significant changes in proportion, gene expression, or subtypes between groups. The study did not report disease-associated states, marker genes, or functional alterations for this cell type, and no genetic or pathological modulators were identified. The low abundance and lack of findings may reflect technical limitations rather than biological absence of vascular involvement in HD.

**Detailed Summary (≈800-1000 words):**  
<metadata>
Al-Dalahmah et al. (2020) present a single-nucleus RNA-seq study of the anterior cingulate cortex in Huntington disease (HD) and control human brains, with a primary focus on astrocyte heterogeneity and disease-associated states. The study also includes analysis of other major cell types, including neurons, oligodendrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), and endothelial/vascular cells.
</metadata>

<methods>
The authors performed snRNA-seq on frozen postmortem cingulate cortex from two grade III/IV HD patients and two controls, using the 10x Genomics Chromium platform. Nuclei were isolated, sequenced, and clustered using a combination of unsupervised and supervised approaches. Cell types were assigned based on gene set enrichment and marker gene expression, with ambiguous clusters resolved by supervised classification. Endothelial cells were specifically identified as a discrete cluster only through supervised assignment, indicating their low abundance and/or technical challenges in detection. Validation experiments (immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, qPCR) were performed, but focused on astrocytes.
</methods>

<findings>
Endothelial and vascular cells were present as a rare population, comprising 19 nuclei out of 4786 total. The authors note that only supervised assignment could robustly detect this cluster, and that unsupervised clustering alone did not yield a clear endothelial group. This suggests that endothelial cells are both low in abundance and potentially underrepresented due to technical limitations of snRNA-seq in frozen human cortex. <keyFinding priority='3'>Endothelial cells were present at low frequency and did not show major proportional changes between HD and control cortex.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words):**  
This study highlights the technical challenges of capturing and analyzing endothelial and vascular cells in single-nucleus RNA-seq from frozen human cortex, particularly in the context of neurodegenerative disease. The absence of significant findings for this cell type may reflect low abundance, technical dropout, or limitations of the sequencing and clustering approach, rather than a true lack of vascular involvement in Huntington disease. Future studies with larger sample sizes, improved nuclei isolation protocols, or targeted enrichment for vascular populations may be necessary to resolve potential endothelial heterogeneity or disease-associated states. The lack of reported subtypes or marker genes means that this dataset does not contribute to the emerging classification schemes for brain vascular cells. No explicit conflicts with prior models are discussed, as the authors do not address vascular pathology in HD. The findings underscore the need for dedicated vascular single-cell studies in neurodegeneration.

# summary for Brase 2021 (endothelial and vascular cells)

**Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This large-scale snRNA-seq study of human parietal cortex in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with diverse genetic backgrounds identified a significant increase in endothelial cell proportions in autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) compared to controls, but did not report further subclustering or detailed transcriptional heterogeneity within endothelial or vascular cells. No disease- or genotype-specific endothelial subtypes or marker gene signatures were described. The main finding for this cell type is a modest but statistically significant expansion in ADAD, suggesting possible vascular involvement, but without deeper molecular or functional characterization. <keyFinding priority='2'>Endothelial cell proportion is increased in ADAD brains</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD), including autosomal dominant (ADAD), sporadic (sAD), and genetic risk/resilience variant carriers.
</metadata>

<methods>
This study performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on 294,114 nuclei from the parietal cortex (Brodmann areas 1–3, 7) of 67 postmortem human brains, enriched for carriers of AD pathogenic mutations (APP, PSEN1), TREM2 risk variants, and the MS4A resilience variant (rs1582763). Cell types were annotated using canonical markers, and deep subclustering was performed for major cell types to identify transcriptional states. Differential gene expression and cell proportion analyses were conducted across genetic backgrounds. Replication was performed using ROSMAP (DLPFC) and 5xFAD mouse data.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions:**
Endothelial cells were identified as a distinct cluster (cluster 12) comprising 3,126 nuclei out of 294,114 total (Table 3, Figure 1b/c). Quantitative analysis revealed a statistically significant increase in the proportion of endothelial cells in ADAD participants compared to controls (β=0.07; P=1.25×10⁻²). This effect was specific to ADAD and not reported for sAD, TREM2, or MS4A variant carriers. <keyFinding priority='2'>Endothelial cell proportion is increased in ADAD brains</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**
Unlike other major cell types (e.g., microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes), endothelial cells were not further subclustered due to the comparatively small number of nuclei. The authors explicitly state: “We identified a comparatively small number of endothelial nuclei, which were not further subclustered (Table 3).” As a result, no distinct endothelial subtypes, cell states, or disease-associated transcriptional programs were reported for this cell type. <keyFinding priority='3'>No endothelial subtypes or transcriptional states were identified or characterized</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression & Pathway Enrichment:**
The study does not report any differentially expressed genes, marker gene signatures, or pathway enrichments specific to endothelial cells in AD, ADAD, or genetic variant carriers. The focus of transcriptional and pathway analyses was on glial and neuronal populations, with endothelial cells omitted from these sections due to low cell numbers and lack of subclustering.

**Spatial/Morphological Validation:**
No spatial transcriptomics, immunostaining, or morphological validation was performed for endothelial cells. The study’s spatial and cross-species validation efforts were directed at microglia and oligodendrocyte subtypes.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**
No pseudotime or trajectory analyses were performed for endothelial cells, nor were any temporal or stage-specific shifts described for this cell type.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**
The mapping of AD GWAS loci to functional cell types did not highlight endothelial cells as a major site of expression or regulatory variation for prioritized AD risk genes. The authors note that for some loci (e.g., EPHA1), the effector cell type might not be well represented in their dataset, such as endothelial cells or pericytes, but provide no further analysis.

**Modulators & Metrics:**
No host or genetic factors (age, sex, APOE, TREM2, MS4A) were reported to modulate endothelial cell states or gene expression, aside from the overall increase in proportion in ADAD.

**Cell-Cell Communication:**
No ligand-receptor or cell-cell communication analyses involving endothelial cells were reported.

**Summary of Negative Findings:**
Overall, the study’s findings for endothelial and vascular cells are limited to a modest increase in cell proportion in ADAD, with no evidence for disease- or genotype-specific subtypes, marker genes, or functional programs. The lack of subclustering and transcriptional analysis is attributed to the small number of endothelial nuclei recovered. <keyFinding priority='3'>Sparse findings for endothelial cells; no evidence for disease-associated subtypes or transcriptional changes</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
The observed increase in endothelial cell proportion in ADAD brains suggests a possible vascular component in the pathogenesis of genetically driven AD, but the absence of further molecular or functional characterization precludes mechanistic insight. No endothelial subtypes or gene signatures were linked to disease stage, pathology, or genetic risk/resilience variants. There are no immediate therapeutic or biomarker implications for endothelial cells based on these data. <keyFinding priority='2'>Endothelial cell expansion may reflect vascular involvement in ADAD, but functional significance is unclear</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study highlights a quantitative expansion of endothelial cells in the parietal cortex of ADAD brains, but does not provide evidence for transcriptional heterogeneity, disease-associated subtypes, or functional reprogramming within this cell type. The lack of subclustering and molecular analysis is attributed to the low number of endothelial nuclei recovered, which may reflect technical limitations or true biological scarcity. Future studies with targeted enrichment, higher sequencing depth, or spatial transcriptomics are needed to resolve potential endothelial heterogeneity and to determine whether vascular cells contribute actively to AD pathogenesis or reflect secondary responses. The authors note that some AD GWAS loci may act through vascular cells, but their dataset was underpowered to address this. There are no explicit conflicts with prior models, as the study does not contradict existing knowledge but rather underscores the need for deeper vascular profiling in AD. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This study used snRNA-seq of human parietal cortex to profile endothelial and vascular cells in Alzheimer’s disease, including autosomal dominant (APP/PSEN1), sporadic, and risk/resilience variant carriers (APOE, TREM2, MS4A). Endothelial cells comprised ~1% of nuclei and showed a significant increase in proportion in ADAD compared to controls (<keyFinding priority='2'>β = 0.07; p = 1.25 × 10⁻²</keyFinding>). However, no further subclustering or disease-specific endothelial subtypes were reported. Shared upregulation of lysosomal genes (HGSNAT, ARSG) was observed in ADAD endothelial cells. No major genetic or pathological drivers of endothelial subtypes were identified. <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>

**Detailed Summary (≈800–1000 words)**

<findings>
The study performed single-nucleus RNA-sequencing on the parietal cortex from a genetically diverse cohort, including ADAD (APP/PSEN1), sAD, and carriers of APOEε4, TREM2, and MS4A variants. After stringent QC, 294,114 nuclei were retained, with major cell types annotated using canonical markers. Endothelial cells were identified as a distinct cluster (cluster 12), comprising approximately 1% of all nuclei, consistent with known brain cell composition.

**Cell Type Proportions and Disease Association**

A key quantitative finding was a significant increase in the proportion of endothelial cells in ADAD participants compared to controls (<keyFinding priority='2'>β = 0.07; p = 1.25 × 10⁻²</keyFinding>). This suggests a possible vascular response or remodeling in the context of autosomal dominant AD. However, the study did not report significant changes in endothelial cell proportions for sAD, TREM2, or MS4A variant carriers, nor for APOEε4 status. <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization**

Unlike other major cell types (astrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocytes, neurons), endothelial cells were not further subclustered due to the comparatively small number of nuclei. The authors explicitly state: “We identified a comparatively small number of endothelial nuclei, which were not further subclustered (Supplementary Dataset 2).” Thus, no distinct endothelial subtypes or disease-associated endothelial states were defined in this dataset. <keyFinding priority='3'>No endothelial subtypes or transcriptional states were reported.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**

Despite the lack of subclustering, the study did analyze differential gene expression across cell types. In ADAD, all cell types—including endothelial cells—showed dysregulation of lysosomal genes HGSNAT and ARSG (<keyFinding priority='2'>Benjamini–Hochberg p = 2.86 × 10⁻²</keyFinding>). This suggests a shared lysosomal or autophagy-related stress response in ADAD, extending to the vascular compartment. However, the magnitude and direction of these changes in endothelial cells were not detailed beyond this shared signature. <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

No additional endothelial-specific marker genes, pathways, or functional signatures (e.g., angiogenesis, blood-brain barrier integrity, inflammation) were highlighted in the main text or supplementary materials. There was no evidence of disease-associated endothelial activation, stress, or immune-related states as seen in other cell types.

**Modulators & Metrics**

No significant associations were reported between endothelial cell states and genetic risk factors (APOEε4, TREM2, MS4A), age, sex, or pathology burden. The only quantitative modulator was the increased proportion in ADAD. <keyFinding priority='2'>Endothelial cell proportion is increased in ADAD, but not in other genetic or clinical groups.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Gene Regulatory Networks, Cell-Cell Communication, and Spatial Analysis**

The study did not report endothelial-specific gene regulatory networks, ligand-receptor interactions, or spatial/morphological validation for endothelial cells. No in situ hybridization, immunostaining, or spatial transcriptomics data were presented for this cell type.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**

No pseudotime or trajectory analyses were performed for endothelial cells, likely due to the low number of nuclei and absence of subclustering.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**

While the study used snATAC-seq and GWAS fine-mapping to link risk variants to effector cell types, endothelial cells were not highlighted as a major effector cell type for any AD GWAS loci. Most chromatin accessibility and co-accessibility signals mapped to microglia, with some to neurons and oligodendrocytes, but not to endothelial cells.

**Summary of Negative Findings**

Overall, the study found that endothelial cells are present in slightly higher proportions in ADAD parietal cortex, and share a lysosomal gene dysregulation signature with other cell types. However, no distinct endothelial subtypes, disease-associated states, or major genetic drivers were identified. The lack of further findings is explicitly acknowledged by the authors.
</findings>

<clinical>
The increase in endothelial cell proportion in ADAD may reflect vascular remodeling or stress in response to early amyloid pathology, but the absence of distinct transcriptional states or disease-specific activation signatures limits mechanistic interpretation. The shared upregulation of lysosomal genes suggests a generalized cellular stress response in ADAD, but its functional significance in the vascular compartment remains unclear. No evidence was found for endothelial involvement in genetic risk variant effects (APOE, TREM2, MS4A) or as a primary effector of AD GWAS loci. Thus, while vascular changes are implicated in AD, this study provides only limited support for endothelial cell-intrinsic mechanisms in the parietal cortex at the single-nucleus transcriptomic level. <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study highlights a modest but statistically significant increase in endothelial cell proportion in the parietal cortex of ADAD brains, with shared lysosomal gene dysregulation, but does not identify distinct endothelial subtypes or disease-associated transcriptional states. The lack of endothelial subclustering may reflect technical limitations (low cell numbers) or true biological homogeneity in this region and disease stage. Future studies with larger sample sizes, targeted enrichment, or spatial transcriptomics may be needed to resolve potential endothelial heterogeneity, activation, or blood-brain barrier dysfunction in AD. The absence of strong genetic or pathological drivers of endothelial states in this dataset suggests that, at least in the parietal cortex, vascular contributions to AD may be secondary or less cell-intrinsic than in other brain regions or disease contexts. This finding is consistent with some prior studies reporting limited endothelial activation in late-stage AD, but contrasts with reports of vascular dysfunction in other regions or models. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Open questions include whether endothelial heterogeneity emerges in other brain regions, at earlier disease stages, or in response to specific genetic risk factors, and how vascular changes interact with glial and neuronal pathology in AD progression.

# summary for Brenner 2020 (endothelial and vascular cells)

**Quick Reference**

This study (Brenner et al., 2020, *Human Molecular Genetics*) used single-nucleus RNA-seq to profile the prefrontal cortex of alcohol-dependent and control individuals, identifying seven major brain cell types. For endothelial and vascular cells, the authors found no significant changes in cell type proportion or differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with alcoholism, but did observe cell type-specific enrichment of neuroimmune genes such as CTNNB1 and FAS. No endothelial subtypes or disease-associated states were reported, and the lack of DEGs suggests minimal transcriptional response in this cell type to alcohol dependence in this dataset. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Detailed Summary**

<metadata>
Brenner E, Tiwari GR, Kapoor M, Liu Y, Brock A, Mayfield RD. (2020). "Single cell transcriptome profiling of the human alcohol-dependent brain." *Human Molecular Genetics*, 29(7):1144–1153. doi:10.1093/hmg/ddaa038  
Disease focus: Alcohol dependence (alcoholism)
</metadata>

<methods>
The study employed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on frozen postmortem prefrontal cortex (PFC) tissue from seven donors (four controls, three alcohol-dependent). Droplet-based snRNA-seq was used, yielding transcriptomes from 16,305 nuclei. Unsupervised clustering identified seven major cell types, including endothelial cells. Cell type assignment was based on canonical marker genes, and differential expression was assessed using a pseudo-bulk approach with DESeq2, controlling for batch effects. The analysis focused on established cell types rather than subclustering for novel states. Validation included marker gene expression and comparison to prior bulk RNA-seq datasets.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Endothelial cells were robustly identified as a distinct cluster using canonical markers (e.g., FLT1, B2M), with proportions consistent across donors and comparable to other snRNA-seq studies. No significant difference in the proportion of endothelial cells was observed between alcohol-dependent and control groups. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression:**  
Critically, the authors report that endothelial cells exhibited zero differentially expressed genes (DEGs) at FDR < 0.05 or FDR < 0.25 when comparing alcoholics to controls. This is in stark contrast to astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia, which showed substantial numbers of DEGs. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Pathway Enrichment:**  
No significant pathway enrichment was detected for endothelial cells, as no DEGs were identified in this cell type. In contrast, other glial cell types showed enrichment for neuroinflammatory and signaling pathways.

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
The study did not report any subclustering or identification of distinct endothelial subtypes or states. The analysis was intentionally performed at low resolution to focus on established cell types rather than novel subpopulations. Thus, all endothelial cells were treated as a single, homogeneous group for the purposes of differential expression and pathway analysis. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Neuroimmune Gene Expression:**  
Despite the absence of DEGs, the authors examined the expression of neuroinflammatory pathway genes across cell types. CTNNB1 and FAS were highlighted as being relatively enriched in endothelial cells compared to other types, but their expression did not differ significantly between alcoholics and controls. The authors note that while mean expression of certain genes (e.g., FAS) is higher in endothelial cells, this does not imply disease association in this context. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
No significant associations were reported between endothelial cell gene expression and host/genetic factors (age, sex, GWAS risk variants), nor were any activation or morphology metrics described for this cell type.

**Gene Regulatory Networks, Cell-Cell Communication, Spatial Analysis, Aging/Disease Trajectories, Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
No findings were reported for endothelial cells in these categories. The study did not perform spatial transcriptomics or morphological validation for endothelial subpopulations, nor did it identify regulatory networks or ligand-receptor interactions specific to this cell type.

**Summary of Negative Findings:**  
Overall, the study found that endothelial and vascular cells in the human PFC show minimal transcriptional response to chronic alcohol exposure at the level of major cell type resolution, with no evidence for disease-associated subtypes, altered proportions, or significant gene expression changes. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
The lack of significant transcriptional changes or disease-associated subtypes in endothelial cells suggests that, within the limits of this dataset and analysis, these cells may not play a major direct role in the molecular pathology of alcohol dependence in the human PFC. This stands in contrast to glial cell types, which showed robust changes. The findings do not support the use of endothelial cell markers or pathways as biomarkers or therapeutic targets for alcoholism based on this study. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications**

The absence of detectable transcriptional changes in endothelial and vascular cells in this study raises several important questions. First, it is possible that endothelial responses to alcohol dependence are subtle, transient, or occur in specific subpopulations not resolved by the low-resolution clustering used here. Alternatively, endothelial dysfunction in alcoholism may be mediated by post-transcriptional, epigenetic, or functional changes not captured by snRNA-seq. The study’s approach—focusing on established cell types and not subclustering—means that rare or disease-associated endothelial states could have been missed. Future work with higher-resolution clustering, spatial transcriptomics, or targeted profiling of vascular subtypes may be needed to fully assess the role of the brain vasculature in alcohol-related pathology. The findings are consistent with prior bulk RNA-seq studies that also failed to detect strong endothelial signatures in alcoholism, as discussed by the authors. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> The study thus provides a valuable negative result, highlighting the specificity of glial responses in alcohol dependence and setting a baseline for future vascular investigations.

# summary for Cain 2023 (endothelial and vascular cells)

<quickReference>
This study (Cain et al., 2023, Nature Neuroscience) provides a high-resolution single-nucleus RNA-seq map of the aging human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), focusing on cell-type heterogeneity in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). For endothelial and vascular cells, six transcriptionally distinct subtypes were identified, including capillary (End.1–3), venous (End.4), arterial (End.5), and smooth muscle (End.6) populations. Notably, the End.2 capillary subset, marked by stress response and AD-related pathways, is increased in AD and associated with tau pathology and cognitive decline. These findings were validated across bulk RNA-seq (n=638) and proteomics, with End.2 and End.4 showing opposite associations with disease progression.

Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD), aging human DLPFC.
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) was performed on DLPFC tissue from 24 individuals spanning clinicopathologic AD states. Six major vascular/endothelial subtypes were defined by unsupervised clustering. The CelMod deconvolution algorithm was used to infer cell-type/subtype proportions in bulk RNA-seq from 638 ROSMAP participants. Validation included spatial transcriptomics, immunohistochemistry, and proteomics.
</methods>

<findings>
The study identified six transcriptionally distinct endothelial and vascular subtypes:
- **End.1, End.2, End.3**: Capillary endothelial cells.
- **End.4**: Venous endothelial cells.
- **End.5**: Arterial endothelial cells.
- **End.6**: Smooth muscle cells.

Each subtype was defined by unique marker genes and pathway enrichments:
- **End.2 (capillary)**: Upregulated stress response genes, MHC protein complex, oxidative phosphorylation, and Alzheimer’s disease pathways. <keyFinding priority='1'>End.2 is significantly increased in AD and strongly associated with tau pathology and cognitive decline in both snRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq (CelMod) analyses.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **End.4 (venous)**: Negatively associated with tau pathology and cognitive decline, suggesting a protective or homeostatic role. <keyFinding priority='2'>End.4 is decreased in AD and inversely correlated with cognitive decline and tau pathology.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **End.1, End.3**: Capillary subtypes with less pronounced disease associations; End.3 showed a positive association with cognitive decline in some analyses.
- **End.5 (arterial), End.6 (smooth muscle)**: Less abundant, with End.5 showing enrichment for wound healing and End.6 for inflammatory response and cell cycle arrest.

**Cell Type Proportions**: Endothelial cells overall did not show major changes in total abundance across disease states, but specific subtypes (notably End.2 and End.4) shifted in proportion with AD pathology and cognitive decline.

**Pathway Enrichment**: End.2 was enriched for stress response, interferon signaling, and AD-related pathways, while End.4 was enriched for pathways related to vascular homeostasis.

**Spatial Analysis**: Spatial transcriptomics confirmed the anatomical localization of endothelial subtypes, with End.2 and End.4 showing distinct laminar distributions.

**Cell-Cell Communication**: Ligand-receptor analysis revealed that End.2 participates in increased signaling within the “cognitive decline” multicellular community, particularly with microglia and astrocyte subtypes associated with AD. <keyFinding priority='2'>End.2 expresses ligands and receptors involved in stress and immune signaling, suggesting cross-talk with glial cells in AD.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**: Mediation analysis placed End.2 downstream of tau pathology and upstream of cognitive decline, suggesting that its expansion may mediate the effect of tau on cognition. End.4 was positioned as protective, with higher proportions in cognitively non-impaired individuals.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**: Proteomic validation showed that markers for End.2 (e.g., IGFBP7) correlated with cognitive decline and tau burden, supporting transcriptomic findings.

**Modulators & Metrics**: No strong evidence for modulation by sex or batch; age was controlled for in all analyses.

**Subtype Summary**:
- **End.2 (capillary, stress/immune response, AD-associated)**: Upregulated stress and AD pathways, increased in AD, associated with tau/cognitive decline.
- **End.4 (venous, homeostatic/protective)**: Downregulated in AD, associated with preserved cognition.
- **Other subtypes**: End.1, End.3 (capillary), End.5 (arterial), End.6 (smooth muscle) showed less robust or no significant disease associations.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
Endothelial and vascular cell heterogeneity is a key feature of the aging and AD brain. The expansion of the End.2 capillary subset, marked by stress and immune response genes, is strongly associated with tau pathology and cognitive decline, suggesting a role in mediating neurovascular dysfunction in AD. Conversely, the End.4 venous subset may be protective. These findings highlight endothelial subtypes as potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets for AD-related cognitive impairment, though causality remains to be established.
</clinical>
</detailedSummary>

<researchImplications>
This study establishes a detailed taxonomy of human cortical endothelial and vascular cells in aging and AD, revealing disease-associated and homeostatic subtypes. The identification of End.2 as an AD- and tau-associated capillary subset aligns with emerging models of neurovascular dysfunction in dementia. The robust multi-modal validation (snRNA-seq, bulk RNA-seq, proteomics, spatial transcriptomics) strengthens confidence in these findings. However, the study notes that rare subtypes (e.g., End.5, End.6) require larger datasets for full characterization, and the cross-sectional design limits causal inference. The authors explicitly state that their findings are consistent with, but extend, prior vascular atlases (e.g., Yang et al., Nature 2022), and do not report contradictions. Open questions include the mechanistic role of End.2 in blood-brain barrier dysfunction, its potential as a biomarker, and whether targeting this subset could modify disease progression. Future work should integrate genetic risk (e.g., GWAS loci) and longitudinal sampling to clarify temporal dynamics and causality.

# summary for Daskalakis 2024 (endothelial and vascular cells)

1) **Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

In this large-scale multiomic and single-nucleus RNA-seq study of PTSD and MDD (Daskalakis et al., Science 2024), endothelial and vascular cells in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) showed disease-associated transcriptomic changes, particularly in MDD. Endothelial cells (Endo) exhibited significant downregulation of adhesion and extracellular transport pathways in MDD, with limited overlap in PTSD. Key marker genes included ICAM1 and COL4A1, both replicated in plasma proteomics and linked to vascular and extracellular matrix (ECM) processes. These endothelial alterations were more pronounced in MDD and were modulated by clinical variables such as childhood trauma and suicide, but not by sex. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>

- Disease focus: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD)
</metadata>

<methods>
This study integrated bulk and single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq), DNA methylation, and proteomics across three brain regions (medial prefrontal cortex [mPFC], dentate gyrus [DG], central amygdala [CeA]) from 231 postmortem brains (PTSD, MDD, neurotypical controls), with replication in two additional cohorts. snRNA-seq was performed on 118 dlPFC samples, enabling cell-type–specific transcriptomic analysis. Blood plasma proteomics (>50,000 UK Biobank participants) and GWAS fine-mapping were also included. Cell type annotation and batch correction were rigorously performed, and pathway analyses were conducted using GSEA and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions:**  
No significant differences in overall endothelial cell (Endo) proportions were detected between disease and control groups in the dlPFC, as estimated from snRNA-seq data. However, disease-specific transcriptomic changes were observed within the Endo population, especially in MDD. <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>

**Differential Gene Expression:**  
In MDD, Endo cells displayed a distinct set of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), with three FDR-significant DEGs identified in the meta-analysis. Among these, ICAM1 (intercellular adhesion molecule 1) and COL4A1 (collagen type IV alpha 1 chain) were highlighted as key marker genes. Both genes are canonical markers of vascular and endothelial identity and function, and their upregulation was replicated in both brain and plasma proteomics datasets. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

ICAM1 was also identified as a hub gene in disease-associated coexpression modules (notably the mPFC-red module), which were enriched for vascular and ECM-related pathways. COL4A1, a major ECM component, was similarly upregulated and replicated in plasma, supporting its systemic relevance. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Pathway Enrichment:**  
Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) of Endo-specific DEGs in MDD revealed significant downregulation of pathways related to cell adhesion, extracellular transport, and ECM organization. These findings were consistent across both transcriptomic and proteomic layers. In contrast, PTSD showed minimal Endo-specific pathway enrichment, with only nominal changes in similar pathways. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
The study did not report further subclustering of endothelial cells into distinct subtypes or states beyond the broad Endo annotation. However, the functional signature of Endo cells in MDD was characterized by:
- Upregulation of ICAM1 and COL4A1 (vascular/ECM markers)
- Downregulation of adhesion and transport pathways
- Association with ECM remodeling and vascular stress responses

No evidence was provided for homeostatic versus disease-associated Endo subtypes, nor for transitions along disease or aging trajectories within the Endo population. <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
Clinical variables such as childhood trauma and suicide completion were primary drivers of molecular variation in both disorders, including in endothelial gene expression. Sex differences were more pronounced in other cell types (e.g., neurons, astrocytes) but not in Endo. No significant modulation by genetic risk variants (e.g., GWAS loci) was reported for Endo-specific DEGs. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Gene Regulatory Networks:**  
ICAM1 and COL4A1 were identified as hub genes in coexpression modules associated with vascular and ECM processes. These modules were also enriched for glucocorticoid-responsive genes, suggesting potential regulation by stress hormones. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell-Cell Communication:**  
While the study did not directly analyze ligand-receptor interactions for Endo, the enrichment of ECM and adhesion pathways implies altered communication between endothelial cells and other brain cell types, particularly in the context of vascular integrity and neuroinflammation.

**Spatial Analysis:**  
Spatial registration of DEGs and DEPs indicated that ECM and vascular gene expression changes were enriched in leptomeningeal and superficial cortical layers, which are rich in non-neuronal (including endothelial) cells. This supports the anatomical relevance of the observed transcriptomic changes. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
A multiomic factor (MOFA factor 13) correlated with age and showed "multiomic age acceleration" in both PTSD and MDD, but this was not specifically attributed to Endo cells. No pseudotime or trajectory analysis was performed for Endo.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
Although GWAS fine-mapping identified risk loci for PTSD and MDD, there was limited overlap between genetic risk and Endo-specific disease process genes. However, the upregulation of ICAM1 and COL4A1 in both brain and blood supports their potential as cross-tissue biomarkers. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
Endothelial and vascular cell dysfunction, as evidenced by upregulation of ICAM1 and COL4A1 and downregulation of adhesion/transport pathways, may contribute to blood-brain barrier (BBB) alterations, ECM remodeling, and neurovascular stress in MDD. These changes are less pronounced in PTSD. The replication of these markers in plasma proteomics suggests potential for blood-based biomarkers of vascular pathology in depression. However, causal or temporal relationships remain speculative due to the cross-sectional nature of the data. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</clinical>

---

3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study provides robust evidence for endothelial and vascular cell involvement in the molecular pathology of MDD, with less pronounced changes in PTSD. The identification of ICAM1 and COL4A1 as upregulated, replicated markers in both brain and blood highlights their potential as biomarkers for neurovascular dysfunction in depression. The lack of clear Endo subtypes or trajectory modeling limits mechanistic insight into how these cells contribute to disease progression or response to stress. Future research should focus on higher-resolution subclustering of endothelial populations, integration with spatial transcriptomics, and longitudinal or experimental models to clarify causality. The findings align with prior reports of vascular and ECM involvement in depression but extend these by demonstrating cross-tissue (brain-blood) concordance and multiomic validation. No explicit contradictions with previous models were discussed by the authors. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

# summary for Davila-Velderrain 2021 (endothelial and vascular cells)

1) **Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This large-scale single-nucleus RNA-seq study of human hippocampus and entorhinal cortex in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) identifies and transcriptionally characterizes vascular cell populations, including endothelial cells, pericytes, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts. Endothelial cells (marked by VWF) and pericytes (PDGFRB) are robustly detected, with vascular cell proportions remaining stable across AD and control groups. While vascular cells show broad expression of AD-associated genes, no major disease-specific subtypes or dramatic proportional shifts are reported. Some gene modules linked to inflammation and exocytosis are upregulated in oligodendrocyte lineage and microglia, but vascular/endothelial cells display only modest, non-specific transcriptional changes across AD stages. <keyFinding priority='2'>Vascular cell transcriptional states are largely preserved in early and late AD, with no evidence for major disease-associated endothelial subtypes or strong genetic/demographic drivers.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>

Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
</metadata>

<methods>
This study profiled 489,558 nuclei from hippocampus and entorhinal cortex of 65 aged human donors (AD and controls) using single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq, 10x Genomics v3). Cell types were annotated via graph-based clustering and marker gene enrichment, with validation from mouse/human spatial transcriptomics and microdissection data. Major cell types, including vascular populations, were identified and compared across disease stages (Braak 0–2, 3–4, 5–6).
</methods>

<findings>
The authors systematically identified major brain cell types, including a vascular cell group enriched for endothelial and pericyte markers. In a second clustering round, they further resolved vascular subtypes: endothelial cells (Endo, marked by VWF), pericytes (Per, PDGFRB), smooth muscle cells (SMC), fibroblasts (Fib, LAMA2, CEMP), and T-cells. These annotations were validated by marker gene expression and cross-referenced with external datasets.

**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Vascular cell populations, including endothelial and pericyte cells, were consistently detected across all donors and brain regions. The proportion of vascular cells did not show significant differences between AD and control groups, nor across Braak stages. This stability was confirmed in Figure 1f and Extended Data Fig. 1d, where cell type fractions are broadly consistent across individuals and pathology groups. <keyFinding priority='2'>No major quantitative changes in endothelial or vascular cell abundance are observed in AD hippocampus or entorhinal cortex.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression & Pathway Enrichment:**  
The study identified 2,495 genes associated with AD pathology, many of which are broadly expressed across multiple cell types, including vascular cells. However, the largest subsets of differentially expressed genes are preferentially expressed in excitatory neurons and microglia, with vascular cells contributing a smaller fraction. Gene ontology analysis of all pathology-associated genes highlights metabolic, cytoskeletal, and synaptic processes, but does not single out vascular/endothelial-specific pathways as dominant in AD-associated changes.

Gene modules with increased expression in AD are most prominent in oligodendrocyte lineage cells (exocytosis, immune response) and microglia (cell cycle, unfolded protein response), while modules with decreased expression relate to synaptic signaling in neurons. Vascular cells do not feature as primary drivers of any major AD-associated gene modules. <keyFinding priority='3'>Vascular/endothelial cells show only modest, non-specific transcriptional changes in AD, with no evidence for a distinct disease-associated endothelial state.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
Endothelial cells are defined by VWF expression, pericytes by PDGFRB, and fibroblasts by LAMA2/CEMP. These subtypes are robustly detected and spatially validated by marker gene localization in 2D projections (Fig. 1e). However, the study does not report further disease-associated subclustering or emergence of novel endothelial or vascular subtypes in AD. The vascular cell group remains transcriptionally homogeneous across disease stages, with no evidence for a transition to a disease-associated endothelial phenotype analogous to DAM microglia or reactive astrocytes. <keyFinding priority='2'>Endothelial and pericyte subtypes are transcriptionally stable and do not display AD-specific subpopulations in this dataset.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
No significant modulation of vascular cell states by age, sex, or APOE genotype is reported. The study does not identify any strong genetic or demographic drivers of endothelial or vascular cell transcriptional changes in AD. <keyFinding priority='2'>No evidence for host or genetic factors selectively modulating vascular cell states in AD hippocampus/entorhinal cortex.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Gene Regulatory Networks, Cell-Cell Communication, Spatial Analysis:**  
The paper does not provide detailed analysis of gene regulatory networks or ligand-receptor interactions specifically for vascular cells. Spatial validation is performed at the level of marker gene expression, confirming the anatomical localization of endothelial and pericyte markers, but without reporting disease-specific spatial remodeling or vascular niche alterations.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories, Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
No pseudotime or trajectory analysis is performed for vascular cells, and there is no evidence for stage-dependent transitions or emergence of disease-associated endothelial states. While some AD GWAS genes (e.g., APOE) are upregulated in glial cells, there is no indication that vascular cells are primary mediators of genetic risk in this dataset.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>  
The authors do not explicitly discuss contradictions with prior reports of blood-brain barrier dysfunction or pericyte/endothelial activation in AD, but their data suggest that, at least in hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, vascular cell transcriptional states are relatively preserved.

</findings>

<clinical>
The study finds that endothelial and vascular cells in the human hippocampus and entorhinal cortex do not undergo major transcriptional or proportional changes in early or late AD. This suggests that, in these regions, vascular dysfunction may not be driven by large-scale shifts in endothelial cell states or abundance. The absence of a disease-associated endothelial signature contrasts with the pronounced activation seen in microglia and astrocytes. While vascular cells express some AD-associated genes, their role appears secondary and non-specific in this context. These findings imply that therapeutic targeting of endothelial cell states may be less relevant for early hippocampal/entorhinal AD pathology, though subtle functional changes not captured by snRNA-seq cannot be excluded. <keyFinding priority='2'>Vascular cell transcriptional stability in AD hippocampus/entorhinal cortex suggests limited direct involvement in early molecular pathology, at least at the level of major cell states.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
</clinical>

3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study provides a comprehensive single-cell atlas of vascular and endothelial cells in the aged human hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, revealing that these populations are transcriptionally stable and do not develop major disease-associated subtypes in Alzheimer’s disease. The findings align with some prior reports of limited endothelial activation in certain brain regions, but contrast with studies suggesting prominent vascular dysfunction or blood-brain barrier breakdown in AD, particularly in cortex or at the protein level. <contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag> However, the authors do not explicitly discuss these discrepancies, and their data suggest that, at least in early-affected hippocampal/entorhinal regions, vascular cell transcriptional changes are modest.

Open questions remain regarding subtle functional or post-transcriptional changes in endothelial cells, regional heterogeneity (e.g., cortex vs hippocampus), and the potential for rare or transient disease-associated vascular states not captured by current clustering. Future studies integrating spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, and blood-brain barrier functional assays may clarify the role of vascular cells in AD pathogenesis. The lack of strong genetic or demographic modulation of vascular cell states in this dataset also suggests that other cell types (microglia, astrocytes) are more prominent mediators of AD risk and pathology in these regions.

(2019). "A single-nuclei RNA sequencing study of Mendelian and sporadic AD in the human brain." Alzheimer's Research & Therapy 11:71. https://doi.org/10.1186/s13195-019-0524-x
Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (Mendelian PSEN1 mutation and sporadic AD)
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nuclei RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on frozen human parietal lobe tissue from three female donors: one PSEN1 p.A79V mutation carrier (Mendelian AD) and two relatives with sporadic AD. Nuclei were unsorted and processed using 10X Genomics Chromium, with both pre-mRNA and mRNA reference alignments. Cell clustering was optimized for even donor representation and cell type specificity. Bulk RNA-seq was also performed for comparison. Cell type annotation relied on established marker genes, and clusters were validated for evenness (entropy) and specificity.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Identification**
Endothelial and vascular cells were identified as a distinct cluster (cluster 13) in the consensus gene set (ConGen) approach, representing a minor fraction of total nuclei (0.11% in Sample1, 0.35% in Sample2, 0.18% in Sample3). The evenness of donor representation in this cluster was high (entropy = 1.42), indicating no major sampling bias.

**Defining Marker Genes and Subtype Characterization**
The endothelial cluster was annotated based on canonical marker genes, including:
- **TM4SF1, SDPR (CAVIN2), FN1, ABCG2, LHFPL2, LCP1**
These markers are consistent with established vascular/endothelial identity in human brain snRNA-seq studies. The cluster did not show evidence of further subclustering or distinct endothelial subtypes, likely due to the low number of nuclei captured.

**Functional Signature and Pathway Enrichment**
The endothelial cluster exhibited expression of genes involved in vascular structure, extracellular matrix, and blood-brain barrier function. No explicit pathway enrichment analysis was reported for this cluster, but the marker profile suggests maintenance of vascular identity.

**Disease Association and Quantitative Changes**
No significant changes in the proportion of endothelial cells were observed between the Mendelian PSEN1 carrier and sporadic AD samples. The authors did not report differential gene expression or pathway activation specific to endothelial cells in relation to AD status, genotype, or pathology. The low abundance of endothelial nuclei limited the power to detect subtle disease-associated changes.

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**
No spatial transcriptomics, immunostaining, or morphological validation of endothelial subpopulations was performed in this study.

**Modulators & Metrics**
No evidence was presented for modulation of endothelial cell states by age, sex, APOE genotype, or other host/genetic factors. The study design (three related individuals, all female, similar age) limited the ability to assess such effects.

**Gene Regulatory Networks and Cell-Cell Communication**
No analysis of gene regulatory networks or ligand-receptor interactions involving endothelial cells was reported.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**
No pseudotime or trajectory analysis was performed for endothelial cells, and no evidence was presented for disease-stage transitions or activation states within this cell type.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**
No integration with eQTLs, GWAS, or multi-omic data was performed for endothelial cells.

Endothelial and vascular cells were robustly identified as a distinct cluster using consensus variable gene selection, with canonical marker expression and even donor representation, but no evidence for disease-associated subtypes or significant transcriptomic changes in AD.

</findings>

<clinical>
The study demonstrates that endothelial and vascular cells can be reliably identified in unsorted snRNA-seq from frozen human AD brain, but provides no evidence for major changes in their abundance or transcriptomic state in Mendelian or sporadic AD. The lack of disease-associated endothelial subtypes or activation signatures suggests that, within the limits of this dataset, vascular cell alterations are not a prominent feature in the parietal cortex at the single-nucleus transcriptomic level. However, the low cell numbers preclude strong conclusions about their role in AD pathogenesis or as therapeutic targets.
</clinical>

---

**Quick Reference**
Endothelial and vascular cells were identified as a distinct, well-defined cluster in snRNA-seq of parietal cortex from Mendelian (PSEN1) and sporadic AD brains, marked by TM4SF1, SDPR, FN1, and ABCG2. Their proportion and transcriptomic profile showed no significant differences between genetic backgrounds or disease status, and no evidence for disease-associated subtypes or activation. All donors (female, similar age) were evenly represented in this cluster.

---

**Research Implications**
This study establishes that unsorted snRNA-seq from frozen human brain can reliably recover endothelial/vascular cell populations using consensus variable gene selection and canonical markers. However, the low abundance of these cells in the dataset limits the ability to resolve subtypes, activation states, or disease-associated changes. The absence of significant transcriptomic alterations or subclustering in endothelial cells contrasts with findings in some larger or sorted datasets, but the authors do not explicitly discuss such discrepancies. Future studies with higher endothelial cell yield, spatial validation, and integration with vascular pathology or genetic risk are needed to clarify the role of vascular cells in AD. The marker set and clustering approach align with established classification schemes, but the lack of disease association in this study should be interpreted cautiously given sample size and technical limitations.

<methods>
This study used single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), snATAC-seq, and snMultiome (joint RNA and chromatin profiling) on prefrontal cortex samples from 388 adults, including both neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disease cases and controls. The dataset comprises >2.8 million nuclei, with harmonized cell type annotation (28 canonical types, including all major vascular and endothelial populations). Validation included chromatin accessibility, motif enrichment, and functional enhancer assays (STARR-seq), as well as integration with eQTL and GWAS data.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Subtypes**  
The study robustly identified and annotated four major vascular and endothelial cell types in the adult human prefrontal cortex: endothelial cells (Endo), pericytes (PC), smooth muscle cells (SMC), and vascular leptomeningeal cells (VLMC). These populations were consistently recovered across all individuals and validated by both transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility profiles. Endothelial cells were defined by canonical markers (e.g., CLDN5, PECAM1), pericytes by PDGFRB, SMCs by ACTA2, and VLMCs by markers such as COL1A1 and COL3A1. <keyFinding priority='1'>Distinct vascular cell types are robustly identified and validated by both RNA and chromatin signatures.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**  
Endothelial and vascular cells exhibited highly cell type–specific gene expression and regulatory element landscapes. The study found that these cell types have a large number of unique differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and cell type–specific cis-regulatory elements (scCREs), many of which are distal enhancers validated by STARR-seq. Pathway analysis revealed enrichment for vascular development, blood-brain barrier function, extracellular matrix organization, and immune signaling. <keyFinding priority='2'>Vascular cell types show strong enrichment for pathways related to barrier function and immune signaling.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Aging and Disease-Associated Changes**  
The study systematically quantified changes in cell type proportions and gene expression with age and disease. Endothelial and VLMC fractions showed significant changes with aging and in Alzheimer’s disease, with a trend toward increased VLMCs and altered endothelial gene expression in older and AD brains. Notably, the number of DEGs associated with aging was higher in disease states, suggesting increased transcriptional variability in vascular cells in schizophrenia and AD. <keyFinding priority='2'>Aging and disease are associated with increased transcriptional variability and altered proportions of vascular cell types.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Genetic Risk and Regulatory Elements**  
By integrating snATAC-seq and eQTL data, the authors identified >85,000 cell type–specific eQTLs per cell type and >550,000 scCREs, with a substantial fraction unique to vascular and endothelial populations. Linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) showed that regulatory elements from endothelial and VLMC populations are significantly enriched for GWAS risk variants for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and Alzheimer’s disease. <keyFinding priority='1'>Endothelial and VLMC regulatory elements are hotspots for genetic risk variants for brain disorders.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell-Cell Communication and Disease Networks**  
Cell-cell communication analysis using ligand-receptor pairs revealed that endothelial and VLMCs act as key "sender" and "receiver" populations in the cortical microenvironment. In disease states, especially schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, the strength and pattern of vascular-to-neuronal and vascular-to-glial signaling was altered, with changes in growth factor, Wnt, and immune-related pathways. For example, Wnt signaling from vascular cells was downregulated in bipolar disorder, and pleiotrophin (PTN) pathway interactions from glia to neurons were reduced in schizophrenia. <keyFinding priority='2'>Vascular cell signaling networks are dynamically rewired in neuropsychiatric disorders.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Gene Regulatory Networks and Modulators**  
Gene regulatory network (GRN) analysis showed that endothelial and VLMCs have distinct sets of transcription factor (TF) bottlenecks and hubs, with RXRA and FOXO4 highlighted as age-associated TFs in these populations. These TFs showed dynamic motif enrichment in scCREs with aging, suggesting regulatory reprogramming of vascular cells in older brains. <keyFinding priority='2'>Age-associated TFs (e.g., RXRA, FOXO4) are dynamically regulated in vascular cells.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**  
Trajectory and pseudotime analyses were primarily focused on neuronal populations, but the study notes that vascular cell gene expression and regulatory landscapes also shift with age and disease, though less is reported about specific sub-trajectories within vascular cells.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**  
The integration of eQTL, chromatin, and GWAS data provides strong evidence that endothelial and VLMCs are key mediators of genetic risk for brain disorders, with cell type–specific regulatory variants affecting gene expression in these populations.

</findings>

<clinical>
The findings position endothelial and vascular cells as critical mediators of genetic and environmental risk in neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. The enrichment of risk variants in their regulatory elements, coupled with dynamic changes in gene expression and signaling in disease and aging, suggests these cell types may contribute to blood-brain barrier dysfunction, neuroinflammation, and altered neurovascular signaling in disease. The identification of age- and disease-associated TFs and regulatory elements in these populations provides potential therapeutic and biomarker targets, though causal roles remain to be experimentally validated. <keyFinding priority='1'>Vascular cell regulatory elements and signaling pathways are promising targets for intervention in brain disorders.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study provides an unprecedented resource for dissecting the role of endothelial and vascular cells in human brain health and disease. The identification of highly cell type–specific regulatory elements and eQTLs, many of which are enriched for genetic risk of major brain disorders, underscores the importance of these populations beyond their classical roles in vascular biology. The dynamic changes in gene expression, regulatory networks, and cell-cell communication with age and disease highlight the need for further mechanistic studies to determine how vascular dysfunction contributes to neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative pathology. The prioritization of age-associated TFs (e.g., RXRA, FOXO4) and disease-enriched regulatory elements in these cell types provides a roadmap for future functional validation and therapeutic targeting. The study’s findings are largely consistent with emerging models of neurovascular dysfunction in brain disorders, and no explicit contradictions with prior data are discussed. However, the authors note that causal relationships remain to be established, and that future work should integrate proteomic, spatial, and developmental data to fully resolve the contributions of vascular cells to brain disease. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

# summary for Frolich 2024 (endothelial and vascular cells)

<quickReference>
Endothelial cells in the human orbitofrontal cortex show significant age-related transcriptomic changes, with most differentially expressed genes (DEGs) being downregulated with age. Key downregulated genes are enriched for pathways related to blood–brain barrier (BBB) transport, suggesting age-associated BBB disruption. These changes are largely independent of psychiatric diagnosis, but overlap with Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-associated gene signatures. No major endothelial subtypes beyond the main cluster were reported. <keyFinding priority='1'>Endothelial cell aging is marked by downregulation of BBB transport genes, potentially contributing to vascular dysfunction in aging and AD.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Disease focus: Aging, psychiatric disorders (mainly schizophrenia), and convergence with neurodegeneration (Alzheimer’s disease).
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) was performed on ~800,000 nuclei from the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) of 87 individuals (ages 26–84, both neurotypical and psychiatric cases). Cell types were identified by Leiden clustering and marker gene expression. Endothelial cells were annotated as a distinct cluster. Analyses included pseudobulk differential expression, pathway enrichment, and cross-disease comparisons. Replication was performed in an independent cohort (n=32).
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Endothelial cell abundance did not significantly change with age (no significant compositional shifts reported for this cell type), indicating that transcriptomic rather than numerical changes predominate with aging.

**Differential Gene Expression:**  
Endothelial cells exhibited a substantial number of age-associated DEGs, with a predominance of downregulation as age increased. The directionality of these changes was consistent between neurotypical and psychiatric cases, and robust to technical covariates. <keyFinding priority='2'>Most age-regulated genes in endothelial cells are downregulated, mirroring patterns seen in other non-neuronal cell types.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Pathway Enrichment:**  
Downregulated DEGs in endothelial cells were significantly enriched for Gene Ontology (GO) terms related to "transport across the blood–brain barrier" and other BBB-associated processes. This supports the hypothesis of age-related BBB dysfunction. <keyFinding priority='1'>Loss of BBB transport gene expression is a defining feature of endothelial aging in the OFC.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
Only a single major endothelial cell cluster was reported. No further subclustering or identification of distinct endothelial subtypes (e.g., arterial, venous, capillary, or tip cells) was described in this study. Thus, all findings pertain to the main endothelial population as a whole. <keyFinding priority='3'>No endothelial subtypes or disease-associated endothelial states were distinguished in this dataset.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
No significant effects of sex, psychiatric diagnosis, or genetic risk scores (polygenic risk for schizophrenia or cross-disorder) were observed on endothelial cell aging trajectories. The age effect was robust across both neurotypical and psychiatric groups.

**Gene Regulatory Networks:**  
No specific transcription factors or regulatory modules were highlighted for endothelial aging.

**Cell-Cell Communication:**  
No ligand-receptor or cross-talk analyses specific to endothelial cells were reported.

**Spatial Analysis:**  
No spatial transcriptomics or in situ validation for endothelial subpopulations was performed.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
Endothelial cell aging signatures overlapped with those seen in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) datasets, particularly for downregulated genes. This suggests that age-related endothelial dysfunction may contribute to or mirror early vascular changes in AD. <keyFinding priority='2'>Endothelial aging signatures converge with AD-associated gene expression changes, especially for BBB-related genes.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
No enrichment of endothelial age-regulated genes for psychiatric or AD GWAS loci was observed, suggesting these changes are not strongly genetically driven.
</findings>

<clinical>
Endothelial cell aging in the human OFC is characterized by downregulation of genes involved in BBB transport, potentially leading to impaired barrier function and increased vulnerability to neurodegenerative processes. The overlap with AD signatures supports a model in which vascular dysfunction is an early and convergent feature of both aging and neurodegeneration. No evidence was found for disease-specific (psychiatric) acceleration or unique endothelial states. These findings highlight BBB transport genes as potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets for age-related cognitive decline and AD, though causality remains to be established. <keyFinding priority='1'>Endothelial BBB dysfunction may be a shared mechanism linking aging and neurodegeneration.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</clinical>
</detailedSummary>

<researchImplications>
This study provides a high-confidence, cell-type-specific map of endothelial aging in the human OFC, emphasizing the loss of BBB transport gene expression as a hallmark. The lack of endothelial subclustering limits insight into potential heterogeneity (e.g., capillary vs. arterial/venous states), which is a key open question for future work. The convergence with AD signatures supports the vascular hypothesis of neurodegeneration, but the absence of genetic enrichment suggests environmental or systemic factors may predominate. Future studies should apply higher-resolution subclustering, spatial transcriptomics, and functional assays to dissect endothelial heterogeneity and causality. The findings are consistent with prior reports of BBB breakdown in aging and AD, and do not contradict established models. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with integration of GWAS for AD, Parkinson’s disease (PD), schizophrenia (SCZ), and related traits.
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) samples from 424 aged individuals (ROS/MAP cohorts), with paired whole-genome sequencing. Major cell types and 64 subtypes were identified. Cell type- and subtype-specific cis-eQTLs (expression quantitative trait loci) were mapped using pseudobulk approaches. Endothelial cells were included as a major cell type, but their low abundance limited statistical power. Validation included comparison to bulk RNA-seq, chromatin state annotation, and integration with GWAS loci.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Detection Power**  
Endothelial cells (End) were among the least abundant cell types in the DLPFC snRNA-seq dataset, resulting in reduced statistical power for eQTL discovery. The number of eGenes (genes with significant cis-eQTLs) detected in endothelial cells was markedly lower than in neurons, astrocytes, or microglia. This scarcity is attributed to both the low frequency of endothelial nuclei and lower UMI counts per cell, which limited the number of genes tested and the accuracy of expression estimates. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> The limited detection of eGenes in endothelial cells is a technical limitation, not necessarily a reflection of biological inactivity.</keyFinding>

**Endothelial Cell Subtypes**  
The study classified endothelial cells as a major cell type but did not report detailed subclustering or distinct endothelial subtypes with unique marker genes or functional signatures. Endothelial cells were included in the eQTL mapping and colocalization analyses, but the low number of nuclei per participant precluded robust identification of endothelial subpopulations or disease-associated endothelial states. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> No distinct endothelial subtypes or disease-associated endothelial states were characterized in this dataset.</keyFinding>

**Differential Gene Expression and eQTLs**  
Endothelial cells exhibited the lowest number of eGenes among the seven major cell types analyzed. The study does not highlight any endothelial-specific eQTLs of major disease genes (e.g., APP, APOE) or pathways. The π1 statistic, which quantifies eQTL sharing between cell types, was lowest for endothelial cells, indicating that few eQTLs were shared with other cell types and that most eQTLs detected in other cell types were not observed in endothelium. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> Endothelial eQTLs were sparse and largely non-overlapping with those in other cell types.</keyFinding>

**Pathway Enrichment and Functional Implications**  
Due to the paucity of endothelial eGenes, the study does not report pathway enrichment or functional signatures specific to endothelial cells. There is no evidence for disease-associated shifts in endothelial gene expression or pathway activation in AD or related pathologies within this dataset. <keyFinding priority='3'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> No disease-associated functional programs were identified in endothelial cells.</keyFinding>

**Colocalization with GWAS Loci**  
Colocalization analyses integrating AD, PD, and SCZ GWAS with cell type-specific eQTLs found that endothelial cells had very few eGenes and, consequently, almost no loci where GWAS risk variants colocalized with endothelial eQTLs. The authors explicitly note that the lack of colocalization in endothelial cells is likely due to undersampling and low detection power, rather than a true absence of genetic effects in this cell type. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> The study cannot currently assess the contribution of endothelial cells to AD or other neurodegenerative disease risk due to technical limitations.</keyFinding>

**Modulators and Metrics**  
No significant modulators (age, sex, APOE genotype, or other genetic risk factors) were reported to influence endothelial cell proportions or gene expression profiles in this dataset. No quantitative activation or morphology scores were applied to endothelial cells.

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**  
No spatial transcriptomics, immunostaining, or morphological validation of endothelial cell states or subtypes was reported.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**  
No evidence was presented for age- or disease-stage–dependent transitions in endothelial cell states, nor for endothelial involvement in AD progression or cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) in this dataset.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**  
Chromatin state analyses included endothelial cells, but no endothelial-specific enhancer or promoter activity was highlighted in relation to AD risk loci or eQTLs.

<keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> The principal finding is that, due to low abundance and technical limitations, endothelial cells in this large snRNA-seq study of aged human DLPFC yielded few eQTLs, no robust subtypes, and no clear disease associations.

**Quick Reference (≈50–100 words):**  
Endothelial cells were among the least abundant cell types in this large snRNA-seq study of aged human DLPFC, resulting in very few detected eQTLs and no robust identification of endothelial subtypes or disease-associated states. No significant associations with AD risk loci, pathology, or genetic/demographic modifiers were observed for endothelial cells, primarily due to technical limitations in sampling depth and detection power.

**Detailed Summary (≈800–1000 words):**

This study by Fujita et al. (Nature Genetics, 2024) represents the largest single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) analysis of the aged human neocortex to date, profiling over 1.5 million nuclei from 424 individuals with paired whole-genome sequencing. The primary aim was to map cis-eQTLs at both cell type and cell subtype resolution, and to integrate these findings with GWAS data for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and related traits. Among the seven major cell types identified, endothelial cells (End) were included as a distinct population, but their analysis was hampered by low abundance and technical limitations.

Endothelial cells were consistently among the least frequent cell types in the DLPFC samples, resulting in a markedly reduced number of nuclei per participant available for pseudobulk expression quantification and eQTL mapping. This scarcity directly impacted the statistical power to detect eGenes—genes with significant cis-eQTLs—in endothelial cells. The authors explicitly note that the number of eGenes detected in endothelial cells was much lower than in neurons, astrocytes, microglia, or oligodendrocytes, and attribute this to both the low frequency of endothelial nuclei and lower UMI counts per cell. This limitation is technical rather than biological, as the study design and sequencing depth were optimized for more abundant cell types. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Unlike for neurons, astrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocytes, the study does not report the identification of distinct endothelial subtypes or cell states. The clustering approach used for other cell types was not able to resolve robust subpopulations within the endothelial compartment, likely due to insufficient cell numbers. As a result, no marker genes, functional signatures, or disease-associated endothelial states are described. The absence of endothelial subtypes is a direct consequence of the limited sampling depth and not interpreted as evidence against endothelial heterogeneity in the human cortex. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

The eQTL mapping revealed that endothelial cells had the lowest number of eGenes among all major cell types. Furthermore, the π1 statistic, which measures the degree of eQTL sharing between cell types, was lowest for endothelial cells, indicating that most eQTLs detected in other cell types were not observed in endothelium. No endothelial-specific eQTLs were highlighted for major AD-related genes such as APP or APOE, nor were any endothelial eQTLs found to colocalize with AD, PD, or SCZ GWAS loci. The authors emphasize that the lack of colocalization is likely due to undersampling and low detection power, rather than a true absence of genetic effects in endothelial cells. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

No pathway enrichment or functional analyses specific to endothelial cells are reported, as the paucity of eGenes precluded meaningful interpretation. Similarly, no modulators—such as age, sex, APOE genotype, or other genetic risk factors—were found to influence endothelial cell proportions or gene expression profiles. No quantitative activation or morphology scores were applied to endothelial cells, and no spatial transcriptomics or immunostaining validation was performed for this cell type.

The study also does not present evidence for age- or disease-stage–dependent transitions in endothelial cell states, nor for endothelial involvement in AD progression or cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). Chromatin state analyses included endothelial cells, but no endothelial-specific enhancer or promoter activity was highlighted in relation to AD risk loci or eQTLs.

In summary, the principal finding regarding endothelial and vascular cells is the technical limitation imposed by their low abundance in the DLPFC snRNA-seq dataset. This resulted in few detected eQTLs, no robust subtypes, and no clear disease associations. The authors caution that this does not exclude a role for endothelial cells in AD or related disorders, but underscores the need for deeper sampling or targeted enrichment in future studies. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> The study does not report any explicit contradictions or departures from prior data regarding endothelial cells, but rather highlights the technical limitations as the primary barrier to discovery in this compartment.

---

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words):**

The findings of this study highlight a critical gap in our understanding of endothelial and vascular cell contributions to AD and related neurodegenerative diseases. The technical limitations of snRNA-seq in capturing rare cell types such as endothelium underscore the need for targeted enrichment strategies, deeper sequencing, or alternative approaches (e.g., single-nucleus ATAC-seq, spatial transcriptomics, or FACS-based enrichment) to resolve endothelial heterogeneity and disease-associated states. The absence of robust endothelial eQTLs or subtypes in this dataset does not preclude their involvement in AD pathogenesis, especially given the known roles of the neurovascular unit and blood-brain barrier dysfunction in dementia. Future studies should prioritize the inclusion of vascular and perivascular compartments, potentially integrating multi-omic and spatial data, to fully elucidate the genetic and functional landscape of endothelial cells in aging and disease. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> No conflicts with prior models are reported; rather, the study calls for methodological advances to address this unresolved area.

# summary for Gabitto 2024 (endothelial and vascular cells)

1) **Quick Reference**

This large-scale, multimodal atlas of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression in human middle temporal gyrus (MTG) reveals that endothelial and vascular leptomeningeal cells (VLMCs) show only modest transcriptional changes and no significant shifts in abundance across the AD pseudoprogression trajectory. Neither endothelial nor VLMC subtypes display strong disease associations, and their gene expression changes are limited in number and magnitude, with no clear modulation by APOE genotype, sex, or pathology load. <keyFinding priority='3'>Endothelial and vascular cell populations remain largely stable across AD stages, with only minor transcriptional perturbations and no evidence for disease-associated subtypes.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

</metadata>

<methods>
This study profiled the MTG from 84 aged human donors spanning the full spectrum of AD neuropathology, using single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq), single-nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq), multiome, and spatial transcriptomics (MERFISH). Cell types were mapped to a high-resolution BRAIN Initiative reference taxonomy, and a continuous pseudoprogression score (CPS) was constructed from quantitative neuropathology to model disease severity. Replication was performed in Brodmann area 9 (A9) and across 10 additional public snRNA-seq datasets.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Endothelial cells and VLMCs were robustly identified and mapped to three endothelial and one VLMC supertype in the expanded taxonomy. Across the CPS, neither endothelial nor VLMC populations showed significant changes in relative abundance. <keyFinding priority='2'>No evidence for selective vulnerability or expansion of endothelial or VLMC subtypes in AD progression.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression:**  
The number of genes with significant expression changes along the CPS in endothelial and VLMC supertypes was very low (about 180 genes, close to the expected false discovery rate). The magnitude of these changes was modest, and no clear pattern of up- or down-regulation of canonical AD or vascular dysfunction genes was observed. <keyFinding priority='2'>Transcriptional changes in endothelial and VLMC populations are limited in scope and do not point to a disease-associated activation or stress response.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Pathway Enrichment:**  
No major pathway enrichments (e.g., inflammation, complement, lipid metabolism, angiogenesis) were reported for endothelial or VLMC subtypes. The study did not identify any disease-associated endothelial or VLMC states analogous to the microglial DAM or astrocyte reactivity programs.

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
- **Endothelial cells:** Three supertypes were mapped, corresponding to canonical endothelial populations. No disease-associated endothelial subtypes were identified. Marker genes (e.g., CLDN5, PECAM1) remained stable across disease stages.
- **VLMCs:** One supertype was mapped, with no evidence for disease-associated subpopulations or significant abundance changes.
- **Pericytes and smooth muscle cells:** These were also mapped but not highlighted as showing any disease association or transcriptional change.

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
No significant modulation of endothelial or VLMC states by age, sex, APOE genotype, or pathology load was reported. Quantitative neuropathology did not reveal vascular cell loss or proliferation.

**Gene Regulatory Networks:**  
No endothelial- or VLMC-specific transcriptional regulators were highlighted as altered in AD.

**Cell-Cell Communication:**  
No major changes in ligand-receptor interactions involving endothelial or VLMC populations were reported.

**Spatial Analysis:**  
Spatial transcriptomics confirmed the expected localization of endothelial and VLMC populations to vascular structures, with no evidence for regional loss, proliferation, or clustering in areas of high pathology.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
Temporal modeling did not reveal stage-specific shifts or transitions in endothelial or VLMC subtypes.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
No eQTL or genetic risk variant associations were reported for endothelial or VLMC subtypes.

</findings>

<clinical>
The study finds no evidence that endothelial or VLMC populations play a direct, disease-driving or protective role in AD pathogenesis within the MTG. Their stability contrasts with the pronounced vulnerability and activation seen in microglia, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. The absence of disease-associated endothelial or VLMC states suggests that vascular dysfunction in AD, if present, may be mediated by other mechanisms or in other brain regions. No biomarker or therapeutic implications for these cell types are proposed. <keyFinding priority='2'>Endothelial and vascular leptomeningeal cells do not emerge as key players in MTG AD pathology in this comprehensive atlas.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

3) **Research Implications**

The SEA-AD atlas provides strong evidence that, in the human MTG, endothelial and VLMC populations are remarkably stable at the transcriptional and compositional level throughout the course of AD. This finding is consistent across single-nucleus, multiomic, and spatial modalities, and is replicated in additional cortical regions and public datasets. The lack of disease-associated endothelial or VLMC subtypes, and the absence of major pathway activation, contrasts with some prior reports of vascular dysfunction in AD, but the authors do not explicitly discuss contradictions with other studies. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Open questions remain regarding whether vascular dysfunction in AD may be more prominent in other brain regions, at earlier disease stages, or mediated by non-cell-autonomous mechanisms (e.g., blood-brain barrier breakdown, pericyte loss). The study’s findings suggest that future research should focus on other glial and immune populations for mechanistic insights and therapeutic targeting in AD, while also encouraging region-specific and multi-omic approaches to vascular biology in neurodegeneration. The classification of endothelial and VLMC subtypes aligns with established BRAIN Initiative reference schemes, supporting the robustness of these annotations.

- Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
</metadata>

<methods>
- Single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) was performed on 482,472 nuclei from occipital and occipitotemporal cortex of 10 AD and 8 control donors, using a FACS-based enrichment strategy to deplete neurons and oligodendrocytes and enrich for less abundant cell types, including vascular populations.
- Cell type identification was based on canonical marker genes; subclustering and differential expression analyses were performed for each major cell type.
- Immunohistochemistry and spatial validation focused primarily on microglia, not vascular cells.
</methods>

<findings>
The study’s primary focus was on microglial heterogeneity and disease association, but all major non-neuronal cell types—including endothelial cells, mural cells (pericytes/smooth muscle), and fibroblasts—were robustly identified and analyzed.

**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Identification:**
- Endothelial cells (CLDN5+), mural cells (PDGFRB+, ACTA2+), and fibroblasts (COL1A1+, DCN+, PDGFRA+) were each recovered as distinct clusters in the UMAP and heatmap analyses (see Fig. 1d,e).
- The endothelial cell cluster comprised 26,957 nuclei, mural cells 12,396, and fibroblasts 22,238, indicating substantial representation for subtype analysis.
- Subclustering was performed for each cell type, but for endothelial, mural, and fibroblast populations, **no significant differences in subcluster distribution were observed between AD and control groups, or between brain regions** (Fig. 1g, S4).

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment:**
- The authors explicitly state that for endothelial cells, fibroblasts, mural cells, CNS-associated macrophages, and lymphocytes, "we did not find regional- or AD-associated changes in subcluster distribution or gene expression" (main text, p. 688; Fig. 1g, S4).
- No disease-associated subtypes or activation states were identified for endothelial or vascular cells.
- No significant changes in cell type proportions were detected for these populations across AD, control, or intermediate (CTR+) groups.

**Spatial/Morphological Validation:**
- No immunohistochemical or spatial validation was performed for endothelial or vascular cell subtypes; all such validation focused on microglia.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories and Modulators:**
- The study did not report any age, sex, genotype, or pathology load effects on endothelial or vascular cell subtypes.
- No pseudotime or trajectory analyses were performed for these cell types, as no disease-associated transitions were detected.

**Gene Regulatory Networks and Cell-Cell Communication:**
- No ligand-receptor or regulatory network findings were reported for endothelial or vascular cells.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**
- No AD GWAS gene enrichment or eQTL analyses were reported for endothelial or vascular cell populations.

<keyFinding priority='3'>The absence of significant AD-associated changes in endothelial, mural, or fibroblast cell subtypes, proportions, or gene expression is a robust negative finding, supported by large cell numbers and consistent across all analyses.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

</findings>

<clinical>
- The study provides **no evidence for a disease-specific role, mechanistic contribution, or biomarker potential for endothelial or vascular cell subtypes in AD** within the sampled cortical regions.
- The authors do not discuss therapeutic implications or vascular contributions to AD based on their data, as no relevant findings emerged.
</clinical>

---

3) **Research Implications**

The robust negative findings for endothelial and vascular cells in this large, well-powered snRNA-seq study suggest that, at least in the sampled cortical regions and disease stages, **these cell types do not undergo major transcriptional or compositional changes in response to amyloid-β or tau pathology**. This contrasts with the pronounced microglial heterogeneity and disease association observed in the same dataset. The results are consistent with prior single-nucleus studies that often report sparse or absent vascular cell changes in AD cortex, though some other studies (not discussed in this paper) have reported subtle blood-brain barrier or vascular dysfunction in AD. The authors do not explicitly discuss any conflicts with prior vascular findings.

Open questions remain regarding:
- Whether vascular cell changes might be more pronounced in other brain regions, at different disease stages, or in white matter.
- The potential for subtle functional or post-transcriptional changes not detectable by snRNA-seq.
- The need for targeted vascular cell enrichment or multi-omic approaches to fully resolve possible AD-associated vascular dysfunction.

# summary for Green 2024 (endothelial and vascular cells)

1) **Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This study (Green et al., 2024, Nature) provides a comprehensive single-nucleus RNA-seq atlas of the aged human prefrontal cortex, identifying 10 distinct vascular and endothelial subpopulations, including arterial, venular, and capillary endothelial cells (End.1–5), arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs), pericytes (Peri.1/2), and fibroblasts. Notably, capillary endothelial subtypes End.3 (ECM/angiogenesis) and End.5 (stress/tau/necroptosis/APP/ADAM10) are highlighted. End.5 is enriched for AD-risk genes and stress pathways, and increases in the AD trajectory, suggesting a late-stage, disease-associated vascular state. These changes are independent of age and are validated in a large, independent cohort.

Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and brain aging.
</metadata>

<methods>
This study used single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to profile 1.65 million nuclei from the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, BA9) of 437 older individuals from the ROSMAP cohort, spanning the full spectrum of AD and aging. The vascular niche was subclustered into 10 subpopulations, and findings were validated using bulk RNA-seq (CelMod deconvolution), spatial transcriptomics, and in situ hybridization.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Diversity**  
The vascular niche comprised 18,496 nuclei, partitioned into arterial, venular, and capillary endothelial cells (End.1–5), arterial smooth muscle cells (SMC.1/2), pericytes (Peri.1/2), and meningeal/perivascular fibroblasts (Fib.1–3). The proportions of these major vascular classes were largely stable across individuals, but specific subpopulations showed disease- and trajectory-associated changes.

**Subtype Characterization**  
- **Capillary Endothelial Cells (End.1–5):**  
  - **End.3:** Characterized by high expression of extracellular matrix (ECM) and angiogenesis genes, suggesting a role in vascular remodeling.  
  - **End.5:** Defined by upregulation of heat- and oxidative stress response genes (e.g., HSPH1), tau binding, necroptosis, and AD-risk genes including APP and ADAM10.  
  - **End.5** is particularly notable for its enrichment in stress and neurodegenerative pathways, and for expressing genes implicated in AD pathogenesis.

- **Pericytes:**  
  - **Peri.1:** ECM-pericyte, aligning with recent reports of pericyte diversity.  
  - **Peri.2:** Transporter-pericyte, with distinct gene expression profiles.

- **Smooth Muscle Cells (SMC.1/2):**  
  - Arterial and venular SMCs, with canonical contractile and vascular tone markers.

- **Fibroblasts (Fib.1–3):**  
  - Meningeal and perivascular fibroblasts, contributing to the vascular niche.

**Disease Associations and Trajectories**  
- **End.5** increases in proportion specifically along the AD (prAD) trajectory, as revealed by the BEYOND computational framework, which models cellular changes across aging and AD.  
- End.5 is part of the late-stage prAD multicellular community (C2.3), which also includes disease-associated glial subtypes (Ast.10, Mic.13, Oli.7).  
- The increase in End.5 is not observed along the alternative brain aging (ABA) trajectory, suggesting specificity to AD-related pathology.

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**  
- **End.5** upregulates genes involved in:  
  - Heat and oxidative stress response (HSPH1, DNAJB1)  
  - Tau binding and necroptosis  
  - AD-risk genes: APP, ADAM10  
- Pathways enriched in End.5 include stress response, protein folding, and cell death, linking vascular dysfunction to neurodegeneration.

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**  
- Spatial transcriptomics (Visium) confirmed the presence and co-localization of End.5 with other late-stage prAD community members in DLPFC tissue from AD trajectory participants.
- No significant age association was found for End.5, supporting its disease specificity rather than general aging.

**Modulators & Metrics**  
- End.5 is not modulated by age, but is associated with increased amyloid and tau burden, and cognitive decline, specifically in the prAD trajectory.
- No explicit genetic (e.g., APOE) enrichment is reported for End.5, but its marker genes overlap with known AD-risk loci.

**Gene Regulatory Networks and Cell-Cell Communication**  
- The study does not detail specific transcription factors or ligand-receptor pairs for End.5, but notes its integration into a multicellular community with glial and oligodendroglial subtypes, suggesting coordinated intercellular signaling in late-stage AD.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**  
- BEYOND analysis reveals that End.5 increases late along the prAD trajectory, coinciding with the rise of stress-responsive glial and oligodendroglial subtypes, and paralleling the accumulation of tau pathology and cognitive decline.
- End.5 is absent from the ABA trajectory, which is characterized by alternative reactive glial and vascular states.

<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>  
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

</findings>

<clinical>
The identification of End.5 as a late-stage, disease-associated capillary endothelial subtype links vascular stress responses and AD-risk gene expression (APP, ADAM10) to the progression of AD. Its specific increase along the AD trajectory, but not with age alone, suggests a role in mediating neurovascular dysfunction and blood-brain barrier compromise in AD. End.5 and its associated pathways may serve as biomarkers for late-stage AD or as therapeutic targets to modulate vascular contributions to neurodegeneration. However, causality is inferred from cross-sectional and computational modeling, warranting further experimental validation.
</clinical>

---

3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study robustly delineates the heterogeneity of vascular and endothelial cells in the aged human cortex, highlighting End.5 as a stress- and AD-risk gene-enriched capillary endothelial subtype that emerges specifically along the AD trajectory. The findings align with, but extend, prior reports of vascular involvement in AD by providing a high-resolution, trajectory-based framework that distinguishes disease-specific from aging-related vascular changes. Open questions include the mechanistic role of End.5 in blood-brain barrier dysfunction, its potential as a biomarker for AD progression, and whether targeting End.5-associated pathways (e.g., APP/ADAM10, stress response) can mitigate neurodegeneration. The study’s integration of spatial transcriptomics and multicellular community modeling sets a new standard for dissecting neurovascular contributions to AD. No explicit contradictions with prior vascular cell models are discussed, but the work emphasizes the need for future studies to experimentally validate the causal and functional significance of End.5 and related vascular subtypes in AD pathophysiology.

**Defining Marker Genes and Functional Signatures:**
- **e1 (AD-associated endothelial subcluster):** Upregulated genes included HLA-E, MEF2C, NFKBIA, and ribosomal genes (RPS19, RPS28).

- Pathway enrichment highlighted increased activity in immune response, cytokine production, ribosome biogenesis, and negative regulation of cell death in AD endothelial cells.
- Both endothelial cells and microglia in AD were enriched for ribosomal and translation initiation processes, suggesting a shared stress or activation response <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>.

**Cell Death and Stress Response:**

**Spatial/Morphological Data:**
- No spatial transcriptomics or in situ validation specific to endothelial subtypes was reported.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**

**Comparison to Other Studies:**
- The authors note that the coordinated upregulation of ribosomal and immune response genes in AD endothelial cells is consistent with cell stress responses observed in other cell types and models, but do not report explicit contradictions with prior vascular transcriptomic data <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>.
</findings>

<clinical>
Endothelial and vascular cells in the AD entorhinal cortex exhibit a robust disease-associated transcriptional program characterized by upregulation of immune response, cytokine secretion, and ribosomal biogenesis genes. These changes may reflect an activated or stressed endothelial phenotype, potentially contributing to neuroinflammation and blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction in AD. The enrichment for negative regulation of cell death genes suggests a compensatory attempt to protect against vascular injury. While the study identifies candidate AD risk genes (e.g., EPAS1) with endothelial-specific expression, the functional and clinical implications remain associative.

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**

Endothelial and vascular cells in the AD entorhinal cortex display a pronounced disease-associated transcriptional shift, with upregulation of immune response (HLA-E, MEF2C, NFKBIA), cytokine secretion, and ribosomal genes (RPS19, RPS28). Two endothelial subclusters were identified, segregating by disease status; the AD-associated subcluster showed increased expression of AD risk gene EPAS1. These changes suggest an activated, stress-responsive endothelial phenotype in AD, potentially contributing to neuroinflammation and BBB dysfunction. No strong modulation by APOE genotype was observed, and no endothelial-specific regulatory drivers were identified.

---

**Research Implications (≈150 words):**

This study provides one of the first single-nucleus transcriptomic characterizations of human entorhinal cortex endothelial cells in Alzheimer’s disease, revealing a robust, disease-associated activation signature. The identification of two transcriptionally distinct endothelial subclusters, with the AD-associated cluster upregulating immune and ribosomal genes, suggests that vascular cells are not passive bystanders but may actively participate in AD pathogenesis. The upregulation of AD risk gene EPAS1 in endothelial cells points to possible genetic contributions to vascular dysfunction in AD, although the study’s limited endothelial cell numbers and lack of spatial validation temper the strength of these conclusions. The absence of endothelial-specific transcriptional regulators driving disease transitions suggests that endothelial activation may be secondary to broader neuroinflammatory processes. Future studies should address the spatial localization, functional consequences, and temporal dynamics of these endothelial states, and clarify their relationship to BBB integrity and neurodegeneration. No explicit conflicts with prior vascular transcriptomic data are discussed by the authors.

Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with additional benchmarking in tuberculosis and prostate cancer bone metastasis.
</metadata>

<methods>
The study introduces the dreamlet R package for efficient pseudobulk differential expression analysis in large-scale single-cell/nucleus RNA-seq datasets. The primary dataset is snRNA-seq from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of 299 postmortem human donors (150 AD, 149 controls), yielding 1.4 million nuclei. Cell types were annotated using a combination of expert curation and machine learning, with 22 clusters identified, including endothelial (Endo) and vascular leptomeningeal cell (VLMC) populations. Differential expression was modeled using precision-weighted linear mixed models, accounting for technical replicates, batch effects, and donor-level variation.  
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Identification:**  
Endothelial and vascular cells were robustly identified as distinct clusters (Endo and VLMC) in the DLPFC snRNA-seq dataset. The study does not report further subdivision of these populations into disease-associated or homeostatic subtypes, nor does it describe the emergence of novel endothelial states in AD. The cell type annotation was based on established marker genes and reference atlases, but specific marker genes for Endo and VLMC are not detailed in the main text.

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment:**  
Across all cell types, the number of differentially expressed genes between AD and controls was strongly dependent on the number of nuclei per subject and the technical reproducibility of measurements. For endothelial and vascular cells, the fraction of genes differentially expressed at FDR < 5% was low compared to microglia, neurons, or astrocytes (see Figure 11H). The study does not highlight any endothelial-specific genes or pathways as significantly altered in AD, nor does it report upregulation of canonical vascular dysfunction or inflammation pathways in these populations. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Variance Partitioning and Modulators:**  
Variance partitioning analysis (Figure 11D, E, F) shows that for most genes in endothelial and VLMC clusters, the largest source of expression variance is donor identity, followed by technical batch (10X pool), with minimal variance explained by AD status. This suggests that, in this dataset, endothelial and vascular gene expression is relatively stable across disease states, and technical factors are more influential than biological disease effects. There is no evidence of strong modulation by age, sex, or AD status for these cell types. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Spatial and Morphological Validation:**  
The study does not report spatial transcriptomics, immunostaining, or morphological validation specifically for endothelial or vascular subtypes. All cell type assignments are based on transcriptomic clustering and marker gene expression.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
No pseudotime or trajectory analysis is presented for endothelial or vascular cells. The study does not discuss transitions between homeostatic and disease-associated endothelial states, nor does it identify any trajectory of activation or dysfunction in these populations in relation to AD pathology.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
No eQTL or GWAS integration is reported for endothelial or vascular clusters. The study does not link AD risk variants to gene expression changes in these cell types.

**Cell-Cell Communication:**  
No ligand-receptor or cell-cell interaction analysis is presented for endothelial or vascular cells.

**Summary of Negative Findings:**  
Overall, the study finds that endothelial and vascular cell populations in the aged human DLPFC show minimal transcriptional response to AD, with no evidence for disease-associated subtypes, major shifts in cell proportions, or strong pathway alterations. This is in contrast to microglia, which show robust AD-associated gene expression changes. The authors note that statistical power is lower in clusters with fewer nuclei, but the lack of signal in endothelial cells is consistent across analyses. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
The findings suggest that, in this large and well-powered snRNA-seq dataset, endothelial and vascular cells in the DLPFC do not exhibit major transcriptional alterations in Alzheimer’s disease. This implies that, at least at the transcriptomic level and in this brain region, vascular dysfunction in AD may not be driven by large-scale changes in endothelial gene expression, or such changes may be subtle and below the detection threshold of current single-nucleus methods. No endothelial subtypes emerge as candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets in this study. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

3) **Research Implications**

The absence of robust disease-associated endothelial or vascular subtypes in this large AD snRNA-seq dataset raises several questions. First, it remains unclear whether subtle or region-specific endothelial changes might be detectable with higher-resolution methods, spatial transcriptomics, or in other brain regions more affected by vascular pathology. The lack of transcriptional response in DLPFC endothelial cells contrasts with some prior reports of vascular dysfunction in AD, suggesting either technical limitations (e.g., low cell numbers, nuclear vs. whole-cell RNA) or true biological stability in this region. The study does not contradict established endothelial marker schemes, but does not extend them with new subtypes. Future work should address whether endothelial dysfunction in AD is mediated by post-transcriptional, epigenetic, or spatially restricted mechanisms, and whether other vascular cell types (e.g., pericytes, not separately annotated here) show greater disease association. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

# summary for Hoffman 2024 (endothelial and vascular cells)

**Quick Reference (≈100 words)**  
This large-scale single-nucleus RNA-seq atlas of the human prefrontal cortex (Hoffman et al., 2024) identifies 414 genes with significant cis-eQTLs in endothelial and vascular cells, revealing cell type-specific genetic regulation. While endothelial cells show fewer eGenes than neurons, the study uncovers distinct regulatory programs and some cell type-specific effects, including dynamic eQTLs across development. No major disease risk colocalizations are uniquely attributed to endothelial or vascular cells, but the dataset provides a critical resource for understanding how genetic variation may influence vascular gene expression in the brain, especially across ancestries and developmental stages.

Disease focus: Neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders (Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, etc.)  
</metadata>

<methods>  
The study performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue from 1,384 donors (35.6% non-European ancestry), yielding 5.6 million nuclei. Nuclei were annotated into 8 major cell classes (including endothelial and mural cells) and 27 subclasses. Genetic regulation was mapped using cis-eQTL and trans-eQTL analyses, with integration of GWAS data for disease risk colocalization. Dynamic eQTLs were assessed along developmental pseudotime trajectories.  
</methods>

<findings>  
**Cell Type Proportions and eQTL Detection:**  
Endothelial cells (Endo) and mural cells (Mural) are among the less abundant non-neuronal cell classes in the dataset. At the class level, 414 eGenes (genes with significant cis-eQTLs) were detected in endothelial cells, a number substantially lower than in neurons (e.g., >10,000 in excitatory neurons), but comparable to other glial and vascular cell types. The number of detected eGenes in each cell type correlates strongly with cell type abundance and average read count per nucleus, reflecting both biological and technical factors.

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
Within the vascular compartment, the study distinguishes between endothelial cells (Endo), mural cells (Mural), pericytes (PC), smooth muscle cells (SMC), and vascular leptomeningeal cells (VLMC) at the subclass level. However, the main text and figures indicate that the majority of eQTL and disease colocalization analyses are reported at the broader class level for endothelial cells, with limited subclass-specific findings for vascular cells.  
- **Endothelial Cells (Endo):** Defined by canonical markers (not explicitly listed in the main text, but typically includes CLDN5, PECAM1, VWF).  
- **Mural Cells (Mural):** Includes pericytes and smooth muscle cells, likely marked by PDGFRB, ACTA2, RGS5.

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment:**  
The study does not highlight specific up- or down-regulated genes or pathways in endothelial or vascular cells in relation to disease status, nor does it report major disease-associated shifts in gene expression for these cell types. Instead, the focus is on the identification of eQTLs—genetic variants that regulate gene expression in a cell type-specific manner.  
- **Pathway Enrichment:** No endothelial-specific pathway enrichments are discussed in the context of disease.  
- **Disease Association:** No endothelial or mural cell eQTLs are reported to colocalize uniquely with GWAS risk loci for Alzheimer’s disease, schizophrenia, or other major brain disorders.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Dynamic and Trans-eQTLs:**  
Dynamic eQTL analysis across developmental pseudotime trajectories reveals that endothelial cells have relatively few dynamic eGenes (genes whose genetic regulation changes with age/development), with the majority of dynamic regulatory effects observed in neurons and glia.  
- **Trans-eQTLs:** Endothelial and mural cells are not highlighted as major hubs for trans-regulatory effects or as mediators of trans-eQTLs linked to disease.

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**  
This study provides the most comprehensive single-nucleus eQTL atlas to date for human brain endothelial and vascular cells, but does not identify major disease-associated regulatory programs or subtypes within these populations. The findings suggest that, at current sample sizes and with available GWAS data, endothelial cells are not primary mediators of common neuropsychiatric or neurodegenerative disease risk. However, the resource enables future fine-mapping of vascular contributions to brain disorders, especially as larger datasets or more targeted vascular GWAS become available. The lack of strong disease associations may also reflect the technical challenge of capturing rare vascular subtypes or the need for region-specific or disease-stage-specific analyses.

If future studies identify endothelial-specific risk mechanisms, this atlas will provide essential context for interpreting those findings and for designing targeted functional or therapeutic studies. No explicit conflicts with prior vascular eQTL studies are discussed by the authors.

# summary for Is 2024 (endothelial and vascular cells)

<quickReference>
This study used single-nucleus RNA-seq of human temporal cortex to dissect vascular cell changes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), focusing on endothelial and vascular cells. Three distinct vascular clusters were identified: pericytes (cl.25), endothelia (cl.26), and perivascular fibroblasts (cl.30). Endothelial cells (cl.26) showed moderate transcriptional perturbation in AD, with upregulation of angiogenesis and endothelial damage genes (e.g., ANGPT2, VWF, ENG, ERG), and pathway enrichment for endothelial development and angiogenesis. The most pronounced vascular changes occurred in pericytes, but endothelia also exhibited disease-associated shifts. Endothelial ANGPT2 was the most significantly upregulated gene in this cluster. No significant changes in endothelial cell proportions were observed by diagnosis, age, sex, or APOE genotype. These findings were validated in external datasets and supported by spatial and morphological analyses.
</quickReference>

<detailedSummary>
<metadata>
Özkan İş et al., 2024, Nature Communications. Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease.
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) was performed on postmortem temporal cortex from 12 AD and 12 age/sex-matched controls (10x Genomics). Nuclei isolation was optimized for rare cell types, and clustering identified major brain cell types, including three vascular clusters. Validation included qPCR, RNAscope, immunohistochemistry, and replication in external snRNA-seq datasets from multiple brain regions.
</methods>

<findings>
The study identified three transcriptionally distinct vascular clusters: pericytes (cl.25), endothelia (cl.26), and perivascular fibroblasts (cl.30). All vascular clusters expressed the BBB-specific transcription factor LEF1, confirming their identity.

**Endothelial Cells (cl.26):**
Endothelial cells were defined by high expression of canonical markers (FLT1, CLDN5, VWF, ENG, ERG, ABCG2, ABCB1, TGM2). These markers were consistent with arteriole, capillary, and venule endothelium. The cluster was transcriptionally distinct from pericytes and fibroblasts, with minimal ambiguity in cell assignment (<0.5%).

**Cell Type Proportions:**
No significant changes in the proportion of endothelial cells (cl.26) were observed between AD and control brains, nor were there associations with age, sex, or APOEε4 genotype. This suggests that, unlike some neuronal populations, endothelial cell abundance is not markedly altered in AD in this region.

**Differential Gene Expression:**
Endothelial cl.26 exhibited 44 differentially expressed genes (34 up, 10 down) in AD versus controls. The most significantly upregulated gene was ANGPT2 (<keyFinding priority='1'>), a key angiogenesis regulator and marker of endothelial activation. Other upregulated genes included VWF (endothelial damage), INSR (angiogenesis), ENG, TGM2, and ERG. Downregulated genes were fewer and less emphasized.

**Pathway Enrichment:**
GO analysis of upregulated genes in cl.26 revealed enrichment for endothelial development, angiogenesis, and extracellular matrix organization (<keyFinding priority='2'>). These pathways are consistent with endothelial activation and vascular remodeling.

**Cell Subtype Characterization:**
- **Endothelial cl.26:** Defined by high FLT1, CLDN5, VWF, ENG, ERG, ABCG2, ABCB1, TGM2. Functionally, this cluster is associated with endothelial barrier function, angiogenesis, and response to injury. In AD, upregulation of ANGPT2 and VWF suggests a shift toward an activated, possibly dysfunctional, endothelial state.
- **Pericytes (cl.25):** While not the main focus here, pericytes showed the largest number of DEGs and were the most perturbed vascular subtype in AD.
- **Perivascular fibroblasts (cl.30):** Expressed ABCA9, CEMIP, C7, with limited DEGs in AD.

**Modulators & Metrics:**
No significant modulation of endothelial gene expression or cluster proportion by age, sex, or APOEε4 was observed. No quantitative activation or morphology scores specific to endothelia were reported.

**Gene Regulatory Networks:**
ERG, a key endothelial transcription factor, was upregulated in AD endothelia, supporting a regulatory shift toward angiogenic and stress-response programs.

**Cell-Cell Communication:**
NicheNet analysis identified several astrocytic ligands predicted to target endothelial genes, but the most robust ligand-target interactions in AD were observed for pericytic SMAD3 and astrocytic VEGFA. For endothelia, ANGPT2 was highlighted as a strong target, but the study prioritized pericyte-astrocyte interactions for experimental validation.

**Spatial Analysis:**
RNAscope and immunohistochemistry confirmed the spatial localization of endothelial markers and validated upregulation of key genes (e.g., ANGPT2) in AD brain vasculature.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**
No evidence for stage-specific or temporal shifts in endothelial subtypes was reported. The changes appear to be cross-sectional and associated with AD diagnosis.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**
No direct eQTL or GWAS variant associations were reported for endothelial-specific genes in this study.

<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
Endothelial cells in AD temporal cortex show a disease-associated activation profile, with upregulation of angiogenesis and endothelial damage markers (notably ANGPT2 and VWF). These changes are consistent with endothelial dysfunction and may contribute to blood-brain barrier (BBB) breakdown, a recognized feature of AD pathogenesis. However, the study’s functional and mechanistic focus was on pericyte-astrocyte interactions, so direct causal links between endothelial changes and BBB integrity remain associative. ANGPT2 and other upregulated endothelial genes may serve as biomarkers of vascular activation or targets for therapeutic modulation of BBB function in AD, but further experimental validation is needed.
</clinical>
</detailedSummary>

<researchImplications>
This study provides a high-resolution map of endothelial and vascular cell heterogeneity in the human AD brain, confirming that endothelial cells are transcriptionally distinct and moderately perturbed in AD. The upregulation of ANGPT2 and other angiogenesis/damage markers aligns with prior reports of endothelial activation in neurodegeneration, but the lack of proportional changes or strong genetic modulation suggests these are functional rather than population-level shifts. The findings support the emerging model of BBB dysfunction in AD, with both pericyte and endothelial contributions. Open questions include whether the observed endothelial activation is protective, maladaptive, or a compensatory response, and how these changes interact with pericyte and astrocyte dysfunction. The study’s prioritization of pericyte-astrocyte (SMAD3-VEGFA) signaling as the main disease driver is consistent with recent literature, but the role of endothelial ANGPT2 and related pathways warrants further mechanistic investigation. No explicit contradictions with prior models were discussed by the authors.

# summary for Jakel 2019 (endothelial and vascular cells)

1) **Quick Reference (Endothelial and Vascular Cells in Jäkel et al., Nature 2019)**

This study performed snRNA-seq on human white matter from control and multiple sclerosis (MS) brains, identifying distinct clusters of endothelial cells, pericytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs). While the main focus was on oligodendrocyte heterogeneity, the vascular cell populations were robustly detected and annotated using canonical markers (e.g., CLDN5, ICAM2 for endothelial cells; PDGFRB for pericytes; NOTCH3 for VSMCs). No major disease-associated changes in vascular cell proportions or transcriptional states were reported, but their presence enabled comprehensive cell-type mapping and highlighted the cellular complexity of MS lesions.

Disease focus: Multiple Sclerosis (MS)
</metadata>

<methods>
The study utilized single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on post-mortem human white matter from five controls and four progressive MS patients. Tissue was sampled from normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) and various lesion types (active, chronic active, chronic inactive, remyelinated). The 10x Genomics platform was used, and clustering was performed with Seurat after canonical correlation analysis (CCA) to minimize batch effects. Cell-type annotation was validated using canonical markers and in situ hybridization.
</methods>

<findings>
The primary focus of the study was on oligodendrocyte lineage heterogeneity, but the authors also identified and annotated vascular cell populations, including endothelial cells, pericytes, and vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), in both control and MS white matter.

**Cell Type Proportions and Identification:**
Endothelial cells were robustly detected as a distinct cluster in the tSNE projections (see Figure 1g, Figure 29a), alongside pericytes and VSMCs. The identification of these vascular populations was based on canonical marker genes:
- **Endothelial cells:** CLDN5, ICAM2
- **Pericytes:** PDGFRB
- **VSMCs:** NOTCH3

These markers were used to confidently assign cell identities, as shown in the tSNE overlays (Figure 1g), where endothelial cells (CLDN5, ICAM2) formed a discrete cluster, separate from pericytes (PDGFRB) and VSMCs (NOTCH3).

**Disease-Associated Changes:**
The study does not report major quantitative or qualitative changes in the proportions or transcriptional states of endothelial or vascular cells between control and MS samples. In Figure 30b, the frequency distribution of all clusters (including endothelial cells, pericytes, and VSMCs) between control and MS nuclei shows that these populations are present in both conditions, with no striking depletion or enrichment. The main cell-type shifts in MS were observed in oligodendrocyte subpopulations, not in vascular cells.

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment:**
No specific differential gene expression or pathway enrichment analyses were reported for endothelial or vascular cells in this study. The focus of such analyses was on oligodendrocyte lineage cells.

**Cell Subtype Characterization:**
The vascular cell populations were not further subdivided into distinct subtypes or activation states in this dataset. The annotation relied on canonical markers, and no disease-associated endothelial or pericyte subpopulations were described.

**Spatial and Morphological Validation:**
While the study performed extensive spatial validation for oligodendrocyte markers, there is no mention of spatial or morphological validation for endothelial or vascular cell subtypes.

**Modulators & Metrics:**
No host or genetic factors (e.g., age, sex, MS risk alleles) were reported to modulate endothelial or vascular cell states in this dataset.

**Cell-Cell Communication:**
The study does not report ligand-receptor or cell-cell communication analyses involving endothelial or vascular cells.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**
No pseudotime or trajectory analyses were performed for vascular cell populations.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**
No eQTL or multi-omic integration was reported for endothelial or vascular cells.

<keyFinding priority='2'>
The robust detection and annotation of endothelial, pericyte, and VSMC populations using canonical markers (CLDN5, ICAM2, PDGFRB, NOTCH3) demonstrates the cellular complexity of human white matter and the utility of snRNA-seq for comprehensive cell-type mapping in MS.

<clinical>
While the main disease-relevant findings of this study pertain to oligodendrocyte heterogeneity, the inclusion and annotation of vascular cell populations provide a valuable resource for future studies of neurovascular interactions in MS. The lack of observed changes in endothelial or vascular cell states suggests that, within the sampled white matter regions and at the resolution of snRNA-seq, these populations are relatively stable in MS compared to the dramatic alterations seen in oligodendrocyte lineage cells. However, the presence of these cell types in the dataset enables future reanalysis for subtle or region-specific vascular changes, which may be relevant for blood-brain barrier integrity or immune cell infiltration in MS.
</clinical>

---

3) **Research Implications**

The robust identification of endothelial, pericyte, and vascular smooth muscle cell populations in this snRNA-seq dataset provides a foundation for future studies of neurovascular biology in MS. Although no major disease-associated changes were detected in these populations in this study, the data could be reanalyzed with a vascular focus to search for subtle transcriptional shifts, rare subpopulations, or region-specific alterations (e.g., at the lesion edge or in perivascular cuffs). The use of canonical markers (CLDN5, ICAM2, PDGFRB, NOTCH3) aligns with established classification schemes for vascular cells in the CNS. The absence of reported changes in vascular cell states in MS white matter contrasts with some prior reports of blood-brain barrier dysfunction or endothelial activation in MS, but this may reflect differences in tissue sampling, disease stage, or the resolution of snRNA-seq. The dataset thus serves as a valuable reference for the vascular landscape of human white matter in health and MS, and highlights the need for targeted vascular analyses in future single-cell studies.

# summary for Johansen 2023 (endothelial and vascular cells)

**QUICK REFERENCE (≈100 words)**

This large-scale snRNA-seq study of 75 adult human cortical samples reveals that endothelial and vascular leptomeningeal cells (VLMCs) are highly conserved in their molecular identity across individuals, but show substantial interindividual variation in gene expression and abundance. VLMCs and endothelial cells exhibit fewer detectable cis-eQTLs than more abundant neuronal types, yet their gene expression is modulated by donor-specific factors, including ancestry and genotype. Notably, the study identifies cell type–specific eQTLs in VLMCs, and highlights that much of the variation in these vascular populations remains unexplained by measured demographic or clinical variables. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

<methods>
This study used single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on cortical tissue from 75 adult donors (31 female, 44 male; ages 19–83) undergoing neurosurgery for epilepsy or tumor. The majority of samples were from the middle temporal gyrus (MTG), with additional frontal cortex and other regions. Nearly 400,000 nuclei were profiled, and cell types were mapped to a high-resolution taxonomy including all major neocortical classes. Quality control and cell type assignment were performed using iterative machine learning approaches, and cell type–specific eQTLs were identified by integrating WGS and snRNA-seq data.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Identification**

Endothelial cells and vascular leptomeningeal cells (VLMCs) were robustly identified as distinct non-neuronal subclasses in the human cortex. These populations were consistently detected across all individuals, confirming their conserved presence in adult neocortex. The study did not further subdivide endothelial or VLMC populations into finer subtypes, but treated each as a single, well-defined subclass.

- **Endothelial cells**: Identified by canonical markers (not explicitly listed in the summary, but typically include CLDN5, PECAM1, VWF).
- **VLMCs**: Defined as a distinct vascular-associated population, likely marked by genes such as PDGFRA, COL1A1, and others (again, not explicitly listed in the summary, but consistent with prior literature).

**Abundance and Interindividual Variation**

Both endothelial and VLMC populations showed relatively low abundance compared to glial and neuronal types, but were present in all donors. The study found that, while the overall cellular architecture is highly conserved, there is substantial interindividual variation in the abundance of most cell types, including vascular populations. However, the magnitude of this variation in endothelial and VLMC populations was less pronounced than in deep-layer glutamatergic neurons or microglia.

- **VLMCs**: Showed detectable interindividual variation in abundance, but the study does not report strong associations with age, sex, disease status, or brain region for these cells. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **Endothelial cells**: Similarly, abundance was stable across individuals, with no significant demographic or clinical correlates reported.

**Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**

Gene expression in endothelial and VLMC populations was highly consistent across individuals, with a core set of marker genes defining each subclass. However, the study identified a moderate number of "high-variance" genes in VLMCs, indicating that some genes within this population are subject to interindividual regulatory differences.

- **VLMCs**: On average, 637 significant cis-eQTLs (FDR < 0.05) were detected, fewer than in more abundant neuronal types. These eQTLs were enriched near transcription start sites, suggesting direct regulatory effects. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **Endothelial cells**: The number of eQTLs was not specified, but was stated to be lower than in neuronal populations, likely reflecting lower cell numbers and/or less genetic diversity in regulatory elements.

**Modulators and Metrics**

The study performed variance partitioning to assess the contribution of donor, ancestry, sex, age, disease status, and technical factors to gene expression variability. For VLMCs and endothelial cells, a substantial fraction of gene expression variance remained unexplained by these measured factors, indicating the presence of additional, unmeasured sources of regulatory variation.

- **Ancestry and genotype**: Some eQTLs in VLMCs were associated with ancestry, but the majority of gene expression variance was not attributable to known demographic or clinical variables.
- **Disease status**: No significant differences in abundance or gene expression were observed in endothelial or VLMC populations between epilepsy and tumor cases, or across brain regions.

**Gene Regulatory Networks and Cell-Cell Communication**

The study did not report specific transcription factors or ligand-receptor interactions unique to endothelial or VLMC populations. However, the identification of cell type–specific eQTLs suggests that genetic variation can modulate gene regulatory networks in these vascular cells.

**Spatial Analysis and Morphology**

No spatial transcriptomic or morphological validation was reported for endothelial or VLMC populations in this study. The focus was on transcriptomic profiling and interindividual variation.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**

No evidence was presented for age- or disease-related transitions in endothelial or VLMC populations. Their abundance and gene expression profiles were stable across the adult lifespan and between clinical groups.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**

The integration of WGS and snRNA-seq enabled the identification of cell type–specific eQTLs in VLMCs, providing a resource for linking genetic risk variants to vascular gene expression in the human cortex.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
Endothelial and VLMC populations are essential for maintaining the blood-brain barrier and neurovascular integrity. This study demonstrates that, while these cell types are highly conserved in the adult human cortex, their gene expression is subject to interindividual genetic regulation, as evidenced by the detection of cell type–specific eQTLs. The lack of strong associations with age, sex, or disease status suggests that vascular cell heterogeneity is largely independent of these factors in the adult cortex. These findings provide a baseline for future studies of vascular dysfunction in neurological disease, but do not directly implicate endothelial or VLMC subtypes in disease mechanisms or as biomarkers in this cohort. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</clinical>

---

**RESEARCH IMPLICATIONS (≈100–200 words)**

This study establishes a foundational reference for endothelial and vascular leptomeningeal cell (VLMC) diversity in the adult human cortex, confirming their molecular conservation and highlighting the presence of cell type–specific genetic regulation. The identification of hundreds of cis-eQTLs in VLMCs, despite their lower abundance, suggests that genetic variation can influence vascular gene expression in a cell type–resolved manner. However, the lack of strong demographic or disease associations indicates that much of the observed heterogeneity is not attributable to common clinical variables. Open questions remain regarding the functional consequences of the identified eQTLs, their potential roles in neurovascular disease, and whether finer subtypes or activation states exist within these populations under pathological conditions. The study’s findings are consistent with prior models of vascular cell stability in the adult cortex, and do not report conflicts with existing classification schemes. Future work integrating spatial transcriptomics, functional assays, and disease cohorts will be necessary to elucidate the contributions of endothelial and VLMC heterogeneity to neurological disorders. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

## 1. Quick Reference (≈100 words)

Kamath et al. (2022) performed single-nucleus RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics on human substantia nigra (SNpc) in Parkinson’s disease (PD) and controls, generating a comprehensive atlas of cell types. For endothelial and vascular cells, the study identified these populations as a distinct major class within the SNpc, but found **no significant disease-associated changes in their proportions or transcriptional states** in PD. No endothelial subtypes were reported as differentially vulnerable or altered in association with PD, age, or genetic risk. The main findings for this cell type are negative, with high confidence due to large sample size and robust methodology.

The study used single-nucleus RNA-sequencing (snRNA-seq) on postmortem human substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) from 8 neurotypical controls and 10 PD/LBD cases, with additional spatial transcriptomics (Slide-seq) in macaque. Over 387,000 nuclei were profiled, including all major brain cell types. Endothelial and vascular cells were identified and annotated based on canonical marker genes. Cell type proportions and transcriptional states were compared between disease and control, with robust statistical modeling and batch correction.

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Endothelial and vascular cells (annotated as "endothelial cell/pericytes") were consistently identified as a major cell class in the SNpc. The study explicitly reports that, among all major cell classes, **dopaminergic neurons showed the largest significant decline in PD/LBD**, while **no significant changes in the proportion of endothelial/vascular cells were observed** between PD/LBD and controls (see Extended Data Fig. 8a).  
<keyFinding priority='2'>Endothelial/vascular cell proportions are stable in PD/LBD SNpc, with no significant depletion or enrichment detected.</keyFinding>

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression & Subtype Analysis:**  
The authors performed clustering and subtype identification for all major cell classes. For endothelial/vascular cells, no disease-associated subtypes or transcriptional states were reported. No significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) or pathway enrichments were highlighted for this cell type in PD/LBD versus control.

**Pathway Enrichment:**  
No specific pathway enrichment or functional signatures were reported for endothelial/vascular cells in the context of PD/LBD. The main focus of pathway analysis was on dopaminergic neurons and glial cells.

**Spatial/Morphological Validation:**  
Endothelial/vascular cells were included in spatial transcriptomics (Slide-seq) mapping in macaque SNpc, confirming their anatomical localization. However, no disease-associated spatial redistribution or morphological changes were reported for these cells.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
No evidence was presented for age- or disease-stage-specific shifts in endothelial/vascular cell states or abundance.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
The study performed heritability enrichment analyses for PD and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) GWAS loci across all major cell types. **Endothelial/vascular cells did not show significant enrichment for PD or AD genetic risk** (see Fig. 4c, Extended Data Fig. 10a).  
<keyFinding priority='2'>No enrichment of PD or AD genetic risk loci in endothelial/vascular cell markers.</keyFinding>

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
No significant effects of age, sex, or other host/genetic factors on endothelial/vascular cell abundance or state were reported.

**Cell-Cell Communication:**  
No specific ligand-receptor interactions or cell-cell communication pathways involving endothelial/vascular cells were highlighted.

**Summary Statement:**  
Overall, the study provides a robust negative result for endothelial and vascular cells in the human SNpc in PD: these cells are transcriptionally stable, show no significant changes in abundance, and are not enriched for PD genetic risk. This contrasts with the marked vulnerability and molecular changes observed in dopaminergic neurons and certain glial subtypes.

</findings>

<clinical>
The findings suggest that **endothelial and vascular cells are not primary contributors to cell-intrinsic vulnerability or pathology in the SNpc in PD**, at least at the transcriptional and proportional level detectable by snRNA-seq. No evidence supports a disease-driving or disease-mitigating role for these cells in this context. The lack of change in these populations implies that vascular dysfunction is not a major cell-intrinsic feature of SNpc pathology in PD, according to this dataset.  
<keyFinding priority='2'>Endothelial/vascular cells are not implicated as disease-relevant or therapeutic targets in SNpc PD pathology based on current data.</keyFinding>

## 3. Research Implications (≈150 words)

The robust negative findings for endothelial and vascular cells in this large, well-powered single-nucleus study suggest that, in the human SNpc, these populations are **not transcriptionally or proportionally altered in Parkinson’s disease**. This contrasts with some prior hypotheses or findings in other brain regions or neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., vascular dysfunction in Alzheimer’s disease), but the authors do not explicitly discuss such contradictions. The absence of disease-associated subtypes or genetic risk enrichment in these cells supports a model in which **cell-intrinsic vulnerability in PD is highly specific to dopaminergic neurons**, rather than being shared with vascular or endothelial populations. Future studies could explore whether subtle functional or post-transcriptional changes occur in these cells, or whether vascular pathology plays a role in other brain regions or disease stages not captured here. The findings align with current classification schemes and reinforce the neuron-centric model of SNpc degeneration in PD.

---

**In summary:**  
Kamath et al. (2022) provide strong evidence that endothelial and vascular cells in the human SNpc are stable and not significantly involved in the primary pathology of PD, as assessed by single-nucleus transcriptomics.

Disease focus: Drug-refractory epilepsy (DRE)
</metadata>

**Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This study used CITE-seq to profile single cells from human drug-refractory epilepsy (DRE) brain lesions, identifying three main neurovascular unit (NVU) cell types: endothelial cells (CLDN5+, VWF+), pericytes (ABCC9+, LPL+), and smooth muscle cells (ACTA2+, MYH11+). Endothelial and vascular cells in DRE lesions showed upregulation of adhesion molecules (VCAM1, ICAM1), integrins (ITGA1, ITGA5), and chemokine receptors (CCR10), facilitating immune cell infiltration. Ligand–receptor analysis revealed strong integrin–collagen interactions between NVU cells and infiltrating immune cells, suggesting a key role for vascular cells in orchestrating neuroinflammation in epilepsy. These interactions were consistent across patients and brain regions.

---

**Detailed Summary (≈800–1000 words)**

<methods>
The authors performed CITE-seq (simultaneous single-cell RNA and surface protein profiling) on immune and non-immune cells isolated from 11 brain tissue samples (6 pediatric DRE patients) from various cortical regions. Cell clustering and annotation were based on canonical markers and surface proteins, with additional validation by multispectral immunohistochemistry (IHC). Ligand–receptor (LR) interactome analysis was used to infer cell–cell communication.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Identification**

The study identified three main NVU (neurovascular unit) cell types among the non-immune (CD45–) clusters:
- **Endothelial cells** (cluster 22): Defined by high expression of *CLDN5* and *VWF*.
- **Pericytes** (cluster 20): Marked by *ABCC9* and *LPL*.
- **Smooth muscle cells (SMCs)** (cluster 13): Expressing *ACTA2*, *PLN*, and *MYH11*.

These NVU cell types were consistently detected across all DRE samples, regardless of anatomical location, and their proportions did not show major quantitative shifts compared to controls, but the study did not provide detailed statistical comparisons for NVU abundance.

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**

NVU cells in DRE lesions exhibited upregulation of genes involved in:
- **Adhesion and trafficking**: *VCAM1*, *ICAM1*, *ITGA1*, *ITGA5*, *ITGA9*, *ITGB1*, *ITGB2*, *ITGB7*, *ITGB8*.
- **Chemokine/cytokine signaling**: *CCR10*, *VEGFA*, *TSLP*.
- **Collagen and extracellular matrix**: Multiple collagen genes (*COL8A1*, *COL4A1*, *COL4A2*, *COL4A5*).

<keyFinding priority='1'>
NVU cells, particularly endothelial and smooth muscle cells, upregulated adhesion molecules and integrins, creating a pro-inflammatory, chemoattractive environment that facilitates immune cell infiltration into epileptic brain tissue.
</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell Subtype Characterization**

- **Endothelial cells (ECs)**: *CLDN5*, *VWF*, *CD34*; upregulated *VCAM1*, *ICAM1*, and collagens. These cells are implicated in leukocyte adhesion and transmigration.
- **Pericytes (PCs)**: *ABCC9*, *LPL*, *KCNJ8*; expressed *TSLP* (potential IL-7-like cytokine), suggesting a role in T cell recruitment.
- **Smooth muscle cells (SMCs)**: *ACTA2*, *MYH11*, *PLN*; expressed collagens and integrins, supporting a structural and signaling role in immune cell trafficking.

<keyFinding priority='2'>
NVU subtypes (ECs, PCs, SMCs) each contribute distinct sets of adhesion molecules, chemokines, and extracellular matrix proteins, collectively supporting immune cell entry and positioning within the epileptic lesion.
</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Ligand–Receptor Interactome and Cell–Cell Communication**

LR analysis revealed:
- **Strong integrin–collagen interactions**: Collagens (produced by NVU cells) interact with integrins (*ITGA1*, *ITGB1*) on infiltrating immune cells (macrophages, T cells).
- **Chemokine/cytokine axes**: NVU cells express ligands (e.g., *TSLP*, *VEGFA*) with cognate receptors (*IL7R*, *VEGFR*) on immune cells.
- **Quantitative network**: Of 265 unique LR pairs between NVU and immune clusters, 206 were between NVU and CNS-associated macrophages (CAMs), indicating particularly strong crosstalk.

<keyFinding priority='1'>
Integrin–collagen and chemokine-mediated interactions between NVU cells and immune cells are a central mechanism for immune infiltration in DRE, paralleling mechanisms seen in autoimmune CNS diseases.
</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**

Multispectral IHC confirmed the presence of endothelial and perivascular cells expressing adhesion molecules in close proximity to infiltrating immune cells in DRE lesions, supporting the transcriptomic findings.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**

The study did not specifically model temporal transitions or aging effects in NVU cells, but the pro-inflammatory and adhesive phenotype was consistent across all DRE samples.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**

No direct eQTL or genetic risk variant analysis was performed for NVU subtypes in this study.

</findings>

<clinical>
The findings suggest that endothelial and vascular cells in DRE lesions are not passive barriers but active participants in creating a pro-inflammatory microenvironment. By upregulating adhesion molecules, integrins, and chemokines, these cells facilitate the recruitment and retention of immune cells, potentially perpetuating neuroinflammation and seizure activity. The integrin–collagen axis, in particular, emerges as a potential therapeutic target, as similar mechanisms are targeted in multiple sclerosis. However, these conclusions are based on cross-sectional, associative data, and causality cannot be definitively established.
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study positions endothelial and vascular cells as central orchestrators of immune cell infiltration in drug-refractory epilepsy, with a molecular signature reminiscent of autoimmune CNS disorders. The identification of integrin–collagen and chemokine axes as key mediators aligns with known mechanisms in multiple sclerosis, suggesting possible shared therapeutic targets. Open questions remain regarding the temporal dynamics of NVU activation, the reversibility of these changes, and whether similar patterns are seen in non-refractory or early-stage epilepsy. The lack of direct genetic or longitudinal data limits causal inference. Future studies should integrate spatial transcriptomics, functional assays, and genetic risk mapping to clarify the role of NVU subtypes in epileptogenesis and to test whether targeting vascular–immune interactions can ameliorate disease. No explicit contradictions with prior models were discussed by the authors.

- <keyFinding priority='2'>: Distinct NVU subtypes contribute unique adhesion/chemokine profiles.

# summary for Lau 2020 (endothelial and vascular cells)

**Quick Reference (≈100 words)**  
Single-nucleus RNA-seq of human prefrontal cortex in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) reveals a marked increase in a specific subpopulation of angiogenic endothelial cells (e1, e3, e4), characterized by upregulation of angiogenesis-related genes (FLT1, VWF, ERG, CLDN5) and MHC-I antigen presentation machinery (HLA-E). These endothelial changes are strongly associated with AD pathology and may be driven by proinflammatory signaling. The expansion of these angiogenic/immune-active endothelial cells is a key feature distinguishing AD from controls, suggesting a potential role for vascular dysregulation in disease progression. <keyFinding priority='1'></keyFinding>

</metadata>

<methods>
This study performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on 169,496 nuclei isolated from postmortem prefrontal cortex (Brodmann areas 6, 8, 9) of 12 AD patients and 9 age-matched normal controls. Cell type annotation was based on canonical and novel marker genes. Subclustering and differential expression analyses were used to resolve cell-type and subpopulation-specific changes. Validation included comparison to large-scale microarray datasets and cross-referencing with other snRNA-seq studies.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Endothelial cells (CLDN5+) comprised a significantly higher proportion of total nuclei in AD brains compared to controls (3.0% ± 0.9% vs. 1.2% ± 0.3%; p < 0.05), indicating an expansion of this cell type in disease. <keyFinding priority='1'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression:**  
A total of 299 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in endothelial cells between AD and controls. Notably, upregulated genes included those involved in angiogenesis (FLT1, VWF, ERG, CLDN5, PECAM1), and immune response/antigen presentation (HLA-E, B2M). <keyFinding priority='1'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Pathway Enrichment:**  
Gene ontology and network analyses revealed that DEGs in AD endothelial cells were significantly enriched for pathways related to angiogenesis, blood vessel morphogenesis, tube development, cell adhesion, cell migration, and MHC-I antigen processing and presentation. <keyFinding priority='1'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
Subclustering identified seven endothelial subpopulations (e1–e7). Only three subpopulations—e1, e3, and e4—were significantly expanded in AD and accounted for the majority of transcriptomic changes. These "AD-upregulated" subpopulations were defined by:

- **Key marker genes:** CLDN5, FLT1, VWF, ERG, HLA-E, EGFL7, ABCA1, IFI27, IFIT1, ATP10A, ELOVL7.
- **Functional signature:** Strong upregulation of angiogenic growth factors/receptors (FLT1, VWF, EGFL7), tight junction and adhesion molecules (CLDN5, PECAM1), and MHC-I antigen presentation machinery (HLA-E, B2M).
- **Pathway associations:** Angiogenesis/adhesion, transmembrane transport, antigen presentation, metal ion homeostasis, cellular respiration, rRNA processing.
- **Disease association:** These subpopulations were specifically increased in AD samples, not in controls, and their gene signatures overlapped with those observed in mouse models of amyloid and tau pathology, suggesting conservation across species. <keyFinding priority='1'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
Ingenuity pathway analysis implicated proinflammatory regulators (IFNG, IRF7, TCR) in the induction of angiogenic endothelial states, suggesting that inflammatory signaling may drive this phenotypic shift. No explicit modulation by APOE genotype or sex was reported for endothelial subtypes, though DEG changes were concordant across sexes.

**Gene Regulatory Networks:**  
Protein–protein interaction analysis (STRING) showed that the upregulated genes in AD endothelial subpopulations form a tightly interconnected network, with hubs in angiogenesis and antigen presentation.

**Cell-Cell Communication:**  
While direct ligand-receptor analysis was not performed, the upregulation of antigen presentation machinery (HLA-E) suggests potential for increased interaction with immune cells, including CD8+ T cells.

**Spatial Analysis:**  
No direct spatial transcriptomics or in situ validation was performed for endothelial subtypes, but the expansion of angiogenic subpopulations is consistent with known vascular abnormalities in AD.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
The expansion of angiogenic/immune-active endothelial subpopulations was specific to AD and not observed in normal aging controls, indicating a disease-specific trajectory.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
No direct eQTL or GWAS integration was reported for endothelial subtypes in this study.

<clinical>
The study identifies a disease-associated expansion of angiogenic and immune-active endothelial cell subpopulations in AD, marked by upregulation of FLT1, VWF, ERG, and HLA-E. These changes may contribute to blood–brain barrier dysfunction, aberrant angiogenesis, and heightened immune surveillance or antigen presentation in the AD brain. The findings suggest that vascular dysregulation and endothelial immune activation are integral to AD pathogenesis and may represent novel therapeutic or biomarker targets. However, causality remains to be established, and the functional consequences of these endothelial changes require further investigation. <keyFinding priority='1'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**  
This study provides strong evidence for the emergence of angiogenic and immune-active endothelial subpopulations in the AD brain, expanding our understanding of vascular contributions to neurodegeneration. The upregulation of both angiogenic factors and MHC-I antigen presentation machinery in these cells suggests a dual role in vascular remodeling and immune modulation, potentially linking neuroinflammation and blood–brain barrier dysfunction. Open questions include whether these endothelial changes are a cause or consequence of AD pathology, how they interact with other cell types (e.g., microglia, T cells), and whether targeting these subpopulations can ameliorate disease progression. The marker genes and subtypes identified here (e.g., FLT1+, VWF+, HLA-E+ endothelial cells) align with emerging concepts of endothelial heterogeneity but represent a novel, AD-specific signature not previously highlighted in single-nucleus studies. No explicit contradictions with prior data are discussed, but the study notes that previous snRNA-seq datasets may have under-sampled endothelial cells, underscoring the value of this work for future mechanistic and therapeutic research. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Quick Reference**

This study used single-nucleus multiomics of human substantia nigra to reveal that endothelial and vascular cells (endothelial cells and pericytes) in PD show cell type–specific dysregulation of cis-regulatory elements (cREs) and gene expression. Endothelial cREs are significantly enriched for PD GWAS risk variants in some cohorts, and key transcription factors such as KLF2 are implicated in risk variant-mediated regulatory disruption. However, compared to oligodendrocytes and microglia, endothelial and vascular cells show fewer disease-associated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and less pronounced pathway enrichment, though they are implicated in protein folding and stabilization pathways. <keyFinding priority='2'>Endothelial cREs are enriched for PD risk variants in two major GWAS studies, suggesting a contributory role for vascular cells in PD genetic susceptibility, with KLF2 as a potential regulatory mediator.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>

---

**Detailed Summary**

<methods>
The authors performed single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) and ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) on postmortem substantia nigra (SN) from 19 individuals (late-stage PD and controls), integrating these with bulk H3K27ac ChIP-seq and in situ Hi-C to map cell type–resolved transcriptomic and epigenomic landscapes. Endothelial cells (Endo; marker: CLDN5) and pericytes (Peri; marker: PDGFRB) were identified and analyzed alongside other major brain cell types.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Endothelial and pericyte nuclei were robustly identified in both snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq datasets (Fig. 1B). The study does not report significant changes in the overall proportion of endothelial or pericyte nuclei between PD and control SN, nor does it highlight major shifts in their abundance, in contrast to the loss of dopaminergic neurons.

**Differential Gene Expression:**  
Endothelial cells and pericytes exhibited relatively few PD-associated DEGs compared to neurons, oligodendrocytes, and microglia (Fig. 1E). The heatmap shows some upregulated genes in Endo, but the number and magnitude are modest. <keyFinding priority='3'>Endothelial and pericyte DEGs are present but not prominent among the 3830 total PD DEGs identified.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>

**Pathway Enrichment:**  
Upregulated DEGs in endothelial cells are enriched for protein folding and stabilization pathways (Fig. S6B, summarized in main text). This suggests a possible stress response or adaptation in vascular cells in PD. <keyFinding priority='2'>Endothelial cells in PD show upregulation of protein folding/stabilization pathways, potentially reflecting cellular stress or altered proteostasis.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
The study does not report further subclustering of endothelial or pericyte populations into distinct subtypes or states, nor does it identify disease-associated subpopulations within these vascular cells. Both are treated as single, relatively homogeneous clusters based on canonical markers (CLDN5 for Endo, PDGFRB for Peri).

**Dysregulated cREs and Chromatin Accessibility:**  
Endothelial and pericyte cREs were annotated using snATAC-seq and integrated with bulk H3K27ac ChIP-seq. The number of dysregulated cREs (up- or down-regulated in PD) assigned to Endo and Peri is not highlighted as especially high or low, but these cell types are included in the global analysis (Fig. 2A).

**GWAS Variant Enrichment and Genetic Modulation:**  
Stratified LD score regression (LDSC) shows that endothelial cREs are significantly enriched for PD GWAS risk variants in two major studies (Chang et al. 2017; Nalls et al. 2014) (Fig. 4A). This enrichment is not as strong or consistent as for oligodendrocytes or microglia, but it is notable. <keyFinding priority='1'>Endothelial cREs are significantly enriched for PD risk variants in two GWAS datasets, suggesting a contributory role for vascular cells in PD genetic susceptibility.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Transcription Factor Disruption:**  
Motif analysis identifies KLF2 as a key transcription factor in endothelial cells whose binding is disrupted by PD GWAS SNPs (Fig. 5E). The delta binding score analysis shows that risk alleles at certain cREs reduce KLF2 binding, potentially altering gene regulation in Endo. <keyFinding priority='2'>KLF2 binding motifs in endothelial cREs are frequently disrupted by PD risk variants, implicating this TF in vascular contributions to PD risk.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>

**Gene Regulatory Networks and Cell-Cell Communication:**  
No specific gene regulatory networks or ligand-receptor interactions are highlighted for endothelial or pericyte cells in this study.

**Spatial Analysis and Morphology:**  
No spatial transcriptomics or morphological validation is reported for endothelial or pericyte subpopulations.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
No pseudotime or trajectory analysis is performed for vascular cells.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
Integration with eQTL data from GTEx shows that some dysregulated cREs in Endo overlap with eQTLs, but this is not a major focus for vascular cells.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
The study suggests that endothelial and vascular cells may contribute to PD pathogenesis through genetic susceptibility mechanisms, as evidenced by the enrichment of PD risk variants in their cREs and the disruption of key TF binding (notably KLF2). However, the functional impact of these changes is less pronounced than in oligodendrocytes or microglia, and the authors do not propose direct causal roles for vascular cells in neurodegeneration. The upregulation of protein folding pathways in Endo may reflect a stress response, but its clinical significance remains unclear. <keyFinding priority='2'>Endothelial cells may mediate genetic risk for PD via regulatory element disruption, but their direct contribution to disease mechanisms is likely modest and requires further investigation.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications**

This study provides the first cell type–resolved evidence that endothelial and vascular cells in the human substantia nigra harbor regulatory elements enriched for PD risk variants, with KLF2 as a candidate TF mediating these effects. However, the lack of distinct disease-associated subtypes or strong transcriptional changes in these cells suggests their role in PD is more subtle than that of glia or neurons. Open questions include whether vascular dysfunction contributes to PD progression or is a secondary effect, and whether targeting endothelial regulatory networks (e.g., KLF2) could modify disease risk or progression. The findings align with emerging models that implicate the neurovascular unit in neurodegeneration, but the study does not report contradictions with prior data. Future work should explore vascular cell heterogeneity, spatial context, and functional consequences of risk variant-mediated regulatory disruption in PD.

## 1. Quick Reference

The PsychAD atlas reveals that endothelial and vascular cells (including VLMCs, SMCs, PCs, and Endo) show increased proportions and upregulated gene expression across most neurodegenerative diseases, especially Alzheimer’s disease, where meningeal VLMC_DCDC2 expansion is prominent. VLMC and SMC subtypes are specifically implicated in AD pathology progression and cognitive decline, with their abundance and gene programs modulated by tau pathology and polygenic risk.

---

## 2. Detailed Summary

<findings>

**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Structure**

The study’s unified taxonomy identifies three major vascular/endothelial subclasses in the DLPFC: vascular leptomeningeal cells (VLMC), smooth muscle cells (SMC), pericytes (PC), and endothelial cells (Endo), each further divided into subtypes (Fig. 2a, Supplementary Table 2). VLMCs are segregated into meningeal (VLMC_DCDC2, VLMC_SLC4A4) and perivascular (VLMC_ABCA6) subtypes. SMCs and PCs are also subclassified, with SMC_MYOC1 and PC_STAC as examples.

In cross-disorder analyses, non-neuronal cell types, particularly vascular cells, are increased in neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) compared to neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs) and controls (<keyFinding priority='1'>Vascular cell expansion is a hallmark of NDDs, especially AD, DLBD, and Vas</keyFinding>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>). Subtype-level analysis reveals that the meningeal VLMC_DCDC2 subtype is specifically increased in most NDDs (Fig. 4c), while other subtypes show more modest or variable changes.

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**

Across AD and related NDDs, vascular and endothelial cell classes exhibit upregulation of genes involved in vascular morphogenesis, muscle tissue development, lipid transport, and negative regulation of vascular permeability (Fig. 6d-e, Supplementary Fig. 6e). Notably, in AD, DEGs in VLMCs are enriched for muscle tissue development pathways, while mural and endothelial cells show upregulation of genes related to vascular permeability and lipid transport (<keyFinding priority='2'>AD is associated with upregulation of vascular permeability and lipid transport genes in mural and endothelial cells</keyFinding>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Cell Subtype Characterization**

- **VLMC_DCDC2**: Defining markers include DCDC2 (up), with functional signatures related to barrier formation and meningeal lymphatic function. This subtype is increased in most NDDs and specifically rises with AD pathology and cognitive decline (<keyFinding priority='1'>VLMC_DCDC2 expansion is strongly associated with AD progression and cognitive impairment</keyFinding>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).
- **SMC_MYOC1**: Marked by MYOC1 (up), involved in smooth muscle contraction and vascular tone. SMCs show AD-specific vulnerability, with increased abundance in AD but not in normal aging (Fig. 6b).
- **Endo_IL1R1/Endo_ITHIS**: Endothelial subtypes marked by IL1R1 and ITHIS, respectively, are upregulated in AD and NDDs, with gene programs related to endothelial differentiation, nitric oxide synthesis, and response to interleukin-17 (IL-17).
- **PC_STAC**: Pericyte subtype marked by STAC, with modest changes in disease but included in the vascular response.

**Disease Progression and Trajectory Modeling**

Trajectory analysis using VAE-based pseudotime (Fig. 7c, Supplementary Figs. 9-11) demonstrates that vascular cells undergo damaging changes in late-stage AD, including reduced lipid transport, decreased vascular permeability, and increased response to IL-17. These changes are associated with cognitive decline and tau pathology (<keyFinding priority='2'>Late-stage AD is characterized by damaging vascular gene programs, including reduced permeability and increased inflammatory signaling</keyFinding>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Modulators and Metrics**

Polygenic risk for AD (PRS) and tau pathology (Braak stage) are upstream drivers of VLMC and SMC expansion. Mediation analysis shows that tau progression increases VLMC abundance, which in turn exacerbates dementia severity (<keyFinding priority='1'>VLMC expansion mediates the effect of tau pathology on cognitive decline in AD</keyFinding>, <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>). The response to IL-17 is highlighted as particularly damaging in mural and endothelial cells.

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**

Spatial transcriptomics (Xenium) confirms the anatomical localization of vascular subtypes, with VLMCs in meningeal and perivascular regions, and SMCs/PCs associated with vessel walls (Fig. 2b).

**Genetic and Multi-omic Integration**

VLMCs and mural cells are implicated in AD GWAS enrichment analyses (scDRS), supporting their genetic association with AD risk (Fig. 2f, Supplementary Table 8).

</findings>

Endothelial and vascular cells, especially meningeal VLMCs and SMCs, are not only increased in abundance in AD and related dementias but also show disease-specific transcriptomic changes that may aggravate pathology. VLMC expansion is linked to tau pathology and cognitive decline, suggesting a role in mediating neurovascular dysfunction and impaired waste clearance. The damaging vascular gene programs in late-stage AD, including reduced permeability and increased inflammatory signaling (e.g., IL-17 response), may contribute to blood-brain barrier breakdown and neuroinflammation. These findings highlight vascular subtypes as potential therapeutic targets for modifying disease progression or enhancing resilience.

## 3. Research Implications

This study establishes a robust, population-scale single-cell atlas of human DLPFC, providing high-confidence evidence that vascular and endothelial cell subtypes—particularly meningeal VLMC_DCDC2 and SMC_MYOC1—are selectively expanded and transcriptionally activated in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. The association of VLMCs with tau pathology and cognitive decline, and the identification of damaging vascular gene programs in late-stage AD, align with emerging models of neurovascular dysfunction in dementia. The findings are consistent with recent vascular atlases and reinforce the role of meningeal lymphatic and barrier-forming cells in disease. However, the causal directionality remains partly inferential, and further experimental work is needed to determine whether targeting VLMCs or modulating vascular permeability can alter disease trajectory. The study’s integration of spatial, genetic, and trajectory analyses sets a new standard for dissecting neurovascular contributions to neurodegeneration.

# summary for Leng 2021 (endothelial and vascular cells)

1) **Quick Reference**

This study (Leng et al., 2021, *Nature Neuroscience*) used single-nucleus RNA-seq to profile the caudal entorhinal cortex (EC) and superior frontal gyrus (SFG) across Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression, focusing on cell-type composition and vulnerability. For endothelial and vascular cells, the authors identified a single broad endothelial cell population in both regions, marked by canonical genes (e.g., **CLDN5**, **FLT1**), with **no significant changes in abundance or disease-associated subtypes** detected across Braak stages in either region. All participants were APOE ε3/ε3 males, minimizing genetic confounders.

Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
</metadata>

<methods>
The study employed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on postmortem human brain tissue from the caudal entorhinal cortex (EC) and superior frontal gyrus (SFG), sampling 10 male APOE ε3/ε3 individuals across Braak stages 0, 2, and 6. The authors used cross-sample alignment and clustering to define cell types and subpopulations, followed by statistical modeling of cell-type proportions and gene expression changes across disease progression. Validation focused on neurons and astrocytes, with immunofluorescence and cytoarchitectonic precision.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Endothelial cells were robustly identified in both EC and SFG, defined by high expression of **CLDN5** and **FLT1**. The authors aggregated clusters assigned to endothelial cells and computed their relative abundance across Braak stages. In both regions, **no statistically significant changes** in the proportion of endothelial cells were observed with AD progression (see Fig. 1f,g and Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). The data showed a stable presence of endothelial cells, with no evidence for selective vulnerability or expansion.

**Differential Gene Expression & Subtype Characterization:**  
The study did not report the identification of distinct endothelial or vascular subtypes beyond the main cluster, nor did it describe disease-associated transcriptional states or activation signatures for these cells. Marker gene analysis confirmed canonical endothelial identity (e.g., **CLDN5**, **FLT1**), but no further subclustering or disease-associated states were described for this cell type.

<keyFinding priority='3'>No disease-associated endothelial subpopulations or activation states were identified in either brain region.</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Pathway Enrichment, Modulators, and Spatial Analysis:**  
The authors did not report pathway enrichment, gene regulatory network analysis, or cell-cell communication findings specific to endothelial or vascular cells. No spatial or morphological validation was performed for this cell type, and no associations with host factors (age, sex, APOE, GWAS variants) were described, as all sequenced individuals were male APOE ε3/ε3.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
There was no evidence for temporal or stage-specific shifts in endothelial cell states or abundance. The authors’ statistical modeling (beta regression) did not reveal significant trends for this cell type, in contrast to the pronounced vulnerability observed in specific neuronal subpopulations.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
No eQTL, GWAS, or multi-omic integration findings were reported for endothelial or vascular cells.

<keyFinding priority='3'>Endothelial cells were transcriptionally stable and did not show evidence of disease-associated remodeling in this dataset.</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
The study concludes that, within the sampled regions and disease stages, endothelial and vascular cells do not exhibit selective vulnerability, disease-associated subtypes, or significant transcriptional changes in AD. This suggests that, at least in the caudal EC and SFG, vascular cell-intrinsic mechanisms are unlikely to be primary drivers of early or late AD pathology, in contrast to the pronounced changes seen in excitatory neurons and reactive astrocytes. No therapeutic or biomarker implications are proposed for endothelial cells in this work.
</clinical>

---

3) **Research Implications**

The absence of significant changes in endothelial and vascular cells in this study raises several questions. First, it suggests that, in the caudal EC and SFG, vascular cell-intrinsic transcriptional responses are not a prominent feature of AD progression, at least in APOE ε3/ε3 males. This finding contrasts with some prior reports of vascular dysfunction in AD, but the authors do not explicitly discuss such discrepancies. The lack of subclustering or disease-associated endothelial states may reflect true biological stability, technical limitations of snRNA-seq for these cell types, or region-specific effects. Future studies should address whether vascular changes are more pronounced in other brain regions, in individuals with different genetic backgrounds (e.g., APOE ε4), or at the level of the blood-brain barrier and pericytes, which were not separately analyzed here. Integration with spatial transcriptomics or proteomics may reveal subtle or localized vascular alterations not captured in this dataset.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>  
No explicit conflicts with prior vascular findings are discussed by the authors.

---

**Summary:**  
In this comprehensive snRNA-seq study of AD progression, endothelial and vascular cells in the caudal EC and SFG were transcriptionally stable, with no evidence for disease-associated subtypes or significant changes in abundance or gene expression. This suggests a limited role for vascular cell-intrinsic mechanisms in these regions and stages of AD, as assessed by this approach.

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**

This study provides a high-resolution atlas of endothelial and vascular cell (EC) heterogeneity in subcortical MS lesions, identifying multiple EC subtypes—including homeostatic, capillary, arteriolar, venular, proliferative, and immune-modulatory (IMEC) states. A distinct "vascular infiltrating" (VI) niche, enriched for ECs, stromal, and T cells, is spatially localized to lesion cores and rims, especially in chronic active MS. ECs in VI niches upregulate genes (EMP2, NECTIN2, AMOTL1) linked to immune cell trafficking and blood–brain barrier dysfunction, with pathway enrichment for JAK-STAT and TGFβ signaling. These vascular changes are most pronounced at inflamed lesion rims and are associated with chronic inflammation and tissue remodeling.

---

**Detailed Summary (≈800–1000 words):**

<findings>
The authors systematically mapped endothelial and vascular cell (EC) diversity and spatial organization in subcortical MS lesions using paired snRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics. ECs were robustly identified as one of nine principal cell types, and further subclustered into multiple subtypes based on marker gene expression and spatial context.

**Cell Type Proportions and Spatial Niches:**  
ECs were present across all samples but showed marked spatial heterogeneity. Unsupervised integration of gene expression and cell type deconvolution revealed a "vascular infiltrating" (VI) niche, characterized by high proportions of ECs, stromal cells, and T cells. This VI niche was predominantly localized to lesion cores (LC) and rims (LR) in MS, especially in chronic active lesions, but was rare in control white matter. <keyFinding priority='1'>The VI niche represents a spatially restricted, disease-associated vascular compartment in MS lesions.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Endothelial Subtypes and Marker Genes:**  
snRNA-seq subclustering identified several EC subtypes, including:
- Homeostatic ECs (expressing VWF, CLDN5)
- Capillary, arteriolar, and venular ECs (distinguished by vessel-type markers)
- Proliferative ECs (cell cycle genes)
- Immune-modulatory ECs (IMECs; upregulating adhesion and immune genes)

In the VI niche, ECs upregulated EMP2 (regulator of VEGFA and integrins), NECTIN2 (CD112, ligand for CD226), and AMOTL1. These genes are implicated in immune cell trafficking and blood–brain barrier (BBB) permeability. <keyFinding priority='1'>ECs in the VI niche display a transcriptional profile favoring immune cell infiltration and vascular remodeling.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Pathway Enrichment:**  
Pathway analysis of VI niche ECs revealed significant enrichment for JAK-STAT and TGFβ signaling, both central to inflammation and tissue remodeling. TNF signaling was also upregulated in most MS-associated niches, indicating sustained inflammatory activation. <keyFinding priority='2'>These pathways suggest ECs in MS lesions are active participants in chronic inflammation and matrix remodeling.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Disease Association and Dynamics:**  
The VI niche and its ECs were most prominent in chronic active (MS-CA) lesions, particularly at the inflamed rim (LR) and lesion core (LC). These regions are known for persistent inflammation, iron accumulation, and lesion expansion. ECs in these areas showed upregulation of genes facilitating leukocyte adhesion and transmigration (e.g., NECTIN2), and integrin signaling (EMP2), consistent with increased BBB permeability and immune cell entry. <keyFinding priority='1'>Spatially restricted EC activation at lesion rims may underlie compartmentalized inflammation in progressive MS.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell-Cell Communication:**  
Computational inference and spatial validation identified key ligand-receptor interactions involving ECs. Notably, ECs in the VI niche were predicted to interact with myeloid and astrocyte populations via integrin and adhesion molecule pathways, supporting a model where ECs orchestrate immune cell entry and local inflammatory crosstalk. <keyFinding priority='2'>ECs in MS lesions are central hubs for cell-cell communication, particularly at the inflamed rim.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators and Metrics:**  
While the study did not report direct genetic or demographic modulators of EC states, the spatial and lesion-type specificity of the VI niche suggests that chronic inflammation and lesion activity are key drivers of EC activation and heterogeneity.

**Validation:**  
Spatial transcriptomics and immunostaining confirmed the localization of ECs and their marker genes to perivascular and rim regions. The overlap between computationally defined VI niches and histopathologically annotated perivascular spaces was substantial (Jaccard index 0.58, ARI 0.62), supporting the robustness of the niche definition. <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Temporal/Aging Trajectories:**  
The VI niche and EC activation were most pronounced in chronic active lesions, with less prominence in chronic inactive lesions, suggesting a dynamic association with ongoing inflammation and lesion progression.

**Integration with Other Data:**  
The upregulation of NECTIN2 (CD112) in ECs is notable, as CD226 gene variants (the NECTIN2 receptor) are linked to MS risk and disease worsening, providing a genetic link between vascular activation and MS susceptibility. <keyFinding priority='2'>EC-immune interactions in the VI niche may be modulated by MS risk alleles.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
Endothelial and vascular cells in MS lesions, especially within the VI niche at lesion rims and cores, are strongly associated with chronic inflammation, immune cell infiltration, and tissue remodeling. Their upregulation of adhesion molecules and inflammatory pathways suggests they may actively mediate compartmentalized inflammation and BBB dysfunction in progressive MS. These findings highlight ECs as potential therapeutic targets for modulating immune cell entry and chronic lesion activity, and as candidate biomarkers for lesion progression. However, causal roles remain to be experimentally validated. <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words):**

This study establishes a detailed framework for endothelial and vascular cell heterogeneity in MS lesions, identifying a spatially and transcriptionally distinct VI niche that is enriched for ECs with pro-inflammatory and immune-trafficking signatures. The upregulation of NECTIN2 and EMP2 in these ECs, and their association with JAK-STAT/TGFβ signaling, aligns with known mechanisms of BBB breakdown and immune infiltration in MS, but provides new spatial and molecular resolution. The overlap with MS risk alleles (CD226-NECTIN2 axis) further suggests genetic modulation of vascular pathology.

Open questions include the precise functional roles of each EC subtype in lesion evolution, the reversibility of VI niche activation, and the potential for targeting EC-immune interactions to limit chronic lesion expansion. The study's findings are consistent with, but extend, prior models of BBB dysfunction in MS by providing spatially resolved, cell-type-specific data. No explicit contradictions with previous data are discussed. Future work should address the causal impact of EC activation on lesion progression and test whether modulating EC pathways can alter disease course in vivo.

Single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) and single-nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) were performed on postmortem human motor cortex (BA4) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA9) from C9-ALS (n=6), C9-FTD (n=5), and control (n=6) donors. Cell type annotation was based on known marker genes. Validation included FANS-sorted bulk RNA-seq, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, and Western blotting. Endothelial and vascular leptomeningeal cells (VLMCs) were among the 14 major cell types analyzed.
</methods>

<quickReference>
Endothelial and vascular leptomeningeal cells (VLMCs) in C9-ALS and C9-FTD showed minimal transcriptional and epigenomic dysregulation compared to other glial and neuronal populations. No significant changes in cell proportions, marker gene expression, or chromatin accessibility were detected in these vascular cell types, and they did not display disease-specific activation or loss. This lack of effect was consistent across both motor and frontal cortices and was not modulated by C9orf72 genotype, age, or sex. <keyFinding priority='3'>Endothelial/VLMCs are largely spared in C9-ALS/FTD at the transcriptomic and epigenomic level.</keyFinding>

<findings>
The study systematically profiled major brain cell types, including endothelial cells and vascular leptomeningeal cells (VLMCs), in C9-ALS, C9-FTD, and controls. Iterative clustering and marker gene analysis robustly identified these vascular populations (e.g., VWF for endothelial cells, CEMIP and P2RY14 for VLMCs). 

**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Endothelial and VLMC populations were present at expected proportions across all diagnostic groups and brain regions.

No DEGs passed the study’s stringent thresholds (FDR < 0.05, |FC| > 1.2) in these cell types.

**Epigenomic and Spatial Analysis:**  
snATAC-seq and H3K27ac ChIP-seq analyses did not reveal significant changes in chromatin accessibility or histone acetylation in endothelial or VLMCs.

**Cell-Cell Communication:**  
The study did not report altered ligand-receptor interactions involving endothelial or VLMCs.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**

<clinical>
The absence of significant transcriptomic or epigenomic changes in endothelial and vascular leptomeningeal cells suggests these cell types do not play a primary or disease-specific role in the pathogenesis of C9orf72-associated ALS or FTD, at least at end-stage disease. There is no evidence from this study that vascular dysfunction, blood-brain barrier disruption, or endothelial activation are major contributors to disease mechanisms in this genetic context. These findings imply that therapeutic or biomarker strategies targeting vascular cells are unlikely to be fruitful in C9-ALS/FTD, based on current data. <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

<researchImplications>
This study provides strong evidence that, unlike astrocytes and excitatory neurons, endothelial and vascular leptomeningeal cells are largely unaffected at the transcriptomic and epigenomic level in C9-ALS and C9-FTD. This contrasts with some prior reports in other neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer’s) where vascular dysfunction is more prominent. The lack of effect is explicitly discussed by the authors as a negative finding, and is consistent across multiple validation modalities. Open questions remain regarding earlier disease stages, regional heterogeneity outside the sampled cortices, and potential subtle functional changes not captured by transcriptomics or chromatin profiling. Future studies could explore vascular function at earlier timepoints or in other ALS/FTD genotypes. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Summary Statement**  
Overall, the study found that endothelial and vascular cells in the ALS cortex do not show significant disease-associated transcriptional changes, subtype heterogeneity, or altered abundance in this dataset. The main findings regarding cell-type-specific vulnerability and disease mechanisms in ALS were centered on neurons, oligodendrocytes, and microglia, with endothelial cells serving as a reference population without notable ALS-specific alterations. <keyFinding priority='3'>Endothelial cells show no significant disease-associated changes in ALS cortex in this study.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

The absence of significant transcriptional or proportional changes in endothelial and vascular cells suggests that, within the limitations of this dataset and cortical region, these cells are not primary mediators of ALS pathology or selective vulnerability.

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**  
In this single-nucleus RNA-seq study of ALS motor cortex, endothelial and vascular cells were robustly identified but showed no significant disease-associated changes in abundance, gene expression, or subtype heterogeneity. Module score analyses for ALS–FTD, AD, and MS risk genes revealed no enrichment in endothelial cells, and no disease-specific subpopulations or functional shifts were reported. The main findings of the study centered on neuronal, oligodendroglial, and microglial alterations, with endothelial cells serving as a stable reference population. No genetic, demographic, or pathological drivers of endothelial cell changes were identified.

---

**Research Implications (≈150 words):**  
This study provides strong evidence that, in the context of ALS motor cortex, endothelial and vascular cells do not exhibit major transcriptomic alterations or disease-associated subtypes, in contrast to the pronounced changes observed in neurons, oligodendrocytes, and microglia. This finding suggests that, at least in the cortical phase of ALS and at the resolution of snRNA-seq, vascular dysfunction is not a prominent feature or driver of disease pathology. The lack of endothelial cell heterogeneity or activation states in ALS also contrasts with some reports in other neurodegenerative or neuroinflammatory conditions (e.g., MS, where blood-brain barrier dysfunction is more prominent). Future studies with larger cohorts, deeper sequencing, or spatial transcriptomics may be needed to detect subtle or region-specific vascular changes, but this dataset argues against a major role for endothelial cell-intrinsic mechanisms in ALS cortical vulnerability. No conflicts with prior models are discussed by the authors. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

# summary for Macnair 2024 (endothelial and vascular cells)

1) **Quick Reference**

This large-scale snRNA-seq study of multiple sclerosis (MS) brain tissue identifies four distinct subtypes of endothelial and vascular cells (including pericytes) in both white and gray matter, with major gene expression changes in MS primarily affecting endothelial cells in white matter lesions. Key findings include upregulation of S1PR3 and extracellular matrix genes in endothelial cells, and the emergence of a stress/inflammatory endothelial state associated with specific patient subgroups, independent of lesion type. These vascular cell changes are most pronounced in patients with high glial stress or immune oligodendrocyte responses, suggesting that endothelial activation is a core feature of certain MS pathological phenotypes, potentially modulated by patient-specific factors rather than classical lesion classification. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on 632,000 nuclei from 156 post-mortem brain samples (WM and GM) from 54 MS patients and 28 controls. The study included all major MS lesion types (active, chronic active, chronic inactive, remyelinated), adjacent normal-appearing WM (NAWM), and controls. Data integration and clustering identified 59 fine cell type clusters, including 4 endothelial cell and 1 pericyte cluster, validated by canonical marker genes and cross-cohort replication.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Subtypes**  
Endothelial and vascular cells (including pericytes) were robustly identified as distinct clusters in both WM and GM, using markers such as CLDN5, FLT1, EPAS1 (endothelial) and EPS8, LAMA2 (pericytes). The study reports four endothelial subtypes and one pericyte subtype, but does not assign unique functional designations to each. These subtypes were present in both MS and control samples, with no evidence of technical or batch-driven clustering.

Quantitative analysis revealed that the overall proportion of endothelial and pericyte cells did not change dramatically between MS and control samples at the broad cell type level. However, at the fine cluster level, there was evidence for shifts in specific endothelial subpopulations in MS white matter lesions, particularly in active and chronic active lesions. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**  
Endothelial cells in MS white matter lesions showed upregulation of genes involved in inflammation, vascular remodeling, and extracellular matrix (ECM) organization. Notably, S1PR3—a receptor targeted by several MS drugs—was significantly upregulated in endothelial cells (and astrocytes) in active and chronic active lesions, consistent with prior protein-level observations. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> Pathway analysis highlighted enrichment for ECM, angiogenesis, and stress response pathways in endothelial cells from MS lesions.

**Cell Subtype Characterization**  
While the paper does not provide a detailed breakdown of marker genes for each endothelial subtype, it notes that the most disease-associated endothelial state is characterized by increased expression of S1PR3, COL22A1, TNC, and ITGB4—genes implicated in vascular remodeling and inhibition of oligodendrocyte maturation. This state is most prominent in patients with high "WM_F3" factor scores, which define a subgroup with strong ECM and inhibitory oligodendrocyte responses. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators & Metrics**  
The emergence of the stress/inflammatory endothelial state is not linked to lesion type, sex, age, MS subtype, or post-mortem interval, but is instead associated with patient-specific molecular phenotypes as defined by MOFA+ factor analysis. Patients with high WM_F3 (ECM/immune oligodendrocyte response) and WM_F1/2 (glial stress/chaperone or DNA damage response) show the most pronounced endothelial activation. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Spatial Analysis and Validation**  
Spatial or morphological validation for endothelial subtypes is not detailed, but the upregulation of S1PR3 and ECM genes in endothelial cells was confirmed by in situ hybridization (RNAscope) in a subset of patients, supporting the snRNA-seq findings. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**  
No evidence was found for a trajectory of endothelial cell states linked to lesion progression; instead, endothelial activation appears to be a global, patient-specific response, present across multiple lesion types and NAWM within the same individual. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**  
No direct eQTL or genetic risk variant associations with endothelial subtypes are reported, and the study notes that larger cohorts would be needed for such analyses.

<clinical>
Endothelial and vascular cell activation—marked by upregulation of S1PR3 and ECM genes—emerges as a core feature of specific MS patient subgroups, independent of classical lesion type. This suggests that vascular dysfunction and blood-brain barrier (BBB) remodeling may contribute to disease progression in a subset of patients, potentially inhibiting remyelination via ECM-mediated effects on oligodendrocyte maturation. The findings imply that endothelial cell states could serve as biomarkers for patient stratification and may represent therapeutic targets, especially in patients with high glial stress or immune oligodendrocyte responses. However, causal links remain speculative due to the cross-sectional design. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</clinical>

---

3) **Research Implications**

This study provides strong evidence that endothelial and vascular cell activation in MS is not simply a byproduct of local lesion pathology, but is instead a patient-specific, global response that may define distinct molecular subtypes of the disease. The identification of an S1PR3/ECM-high endothelial state, particularly in patients with glial stress or immune oligodendrocyte phenotypes, raises important questions about the role of the vasculature in MS progression and remyelination failure. Future research should aim to: (1) further resolve endothelial subtypes and their functional roles using spatial transcriptomics or proteomics; (2) determine whether these vascular states are stable over time or modifiable by therapy; (3) explore links to genetic risk and peripheral biomarkers; and (4) test whether targeting endothelial activation (e.g., via S1PR modulators or ECM remodeling) can improve outcomes in stratified patient subgroups. The findings are broadly consistent with emerging models of BBB dysfunction in MS, but the explicit patient-level stratification and integration with glial phenotypes represent a significant advance. No explicit contradictions with prior data are discussed by the authors. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Detailed Summary (≈800–1000 words):**

<findings>
Martirosyan et al. (2024) conducted a large-scale single-nucleus RNA-seq study of the human substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) in Parkinson’s Disease (PD), with a focus on cell-type heterogeneity and disease-associated changes. Among the ~84,000 high-quality nuclei analyzed, all major CNS cell types were recovered, including a discrete population of vascular cells (VC), which encompasses endothelial and mural cells.

**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Identification:**
Vascular cells represented approximately 2.28% of the total nuclei in the SNpc dataset, a proportion consistent with prior studies using unbiased nuclear capture. The VC cluster was identified based on canonical marker gene expression, specifically FLT1 (VEGFR1, a pan-endothelial marker) and DCN (decorin, a pericyte/mural cell marker), as shown in Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure 1A. The authors did not report further subclustering of the VC population, nor did they distinguish between endothelial and mural/pericyte subtypes within the SNpc. <keyFinding priority='3'>The vascular cell compartment was treated as a single, transcriptionally homogeneous group in this study.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Disease Association and Differential Abundance:**
Quantitative analysis of cell type proportions (Figure 1F, Supplementary Table 3) revealed no statistically significant change in the abundance of vascular cells between PD and control samples. The binomial test for divergence from expected proportions did not reach significance for the VC cluster, in contrast to the marked depletion of neurons and increase in glial and T cell populations in PD. <keyFinding priority='2'>No evidence was found for selective vulnerability or expansion of vascular cells in PD SNpc.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Analysis:**
The study did not report any significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the VC population between PD and control samples. Marker gene analysis for the VC cluster was limited to cell identity (FLT1, DCN), and no disease-associated transcriptomic shifts or pathway enrichments were described for vascular cells. The main text and supplementary tables focus on neurons and glia, with no mention of altered vascular cell gene expression in PD. <keyFinding priority='2'>No disease-associated molecular signatures were detected in SNpc vascular cells.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Spatial and Morphological Validation:**
Spatial transcriptomics (Molecular Cartography) was performed on a subset of SNpc sections from both PD and control donors. Clustering of spatial transcriptomics data confirmed the presence of vascular cells, with expression of FLT1 and DCN validating their identity (Figure 1G,H). No spatial redistribution, clustering, or morphological changes of vascular cells were reported in PD samples. <keyFinding priority='2'>Spatial transcriptomics confirmed the presence and marker expression of vascular cells, but did not reveal disease-associated spatial changes.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell-Cell Communication and Genetic Modulation:**
The authors did not report any analysis of ligand-receptor interactions, cell-cell communication, or gene regulatory networks involving vascular cells. There was no evidence for modulation of vascular cell states by age, sex, or PD risk alleles. GWAS and monogenic PD gene enrichment analyses did not highlight vascular cells as a site of risk gene expression or variant effect. <keyFinding priority='3'>No genetic or host factors were found to modulate vascular cell states in SNpc.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Comparison to Prior Data:**
The authors note that the level of vascular cell recovery is consistent with other unbiased snRNA-seq studies of human midbrain/SNpc, and that their dataset recapitulates the expected cellular heterogeneity. However, they do not discuss any contradictions or departures from previous reports regarding vascular cell involvement in PD. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
The study finds no evidence for a disease-specific role of endothelial or vascular cells in the SNpc in sporadic PD. Unlike neurons and glia, vascular cells do not show depletion, expansion, or transcriptomic reprogramming in PD. There are no mechanistic insights or biomarker implications for vascular cells in this region based on these data. The results suggest that, at least in the SNpc, vascular/endothelial dysfunction is not a prominent feature of sporadic PD pathology. <keyFinding priority='2'>Vascular cells appear to be largely unaffected in terms of abundance and molecular state in PD SNpc.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words):**

This study provides a high-confidence negative result for the involvement of vascular/endothelial cells in the SNpc in sporadic PD, as assessed by snRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics. The lack of detectable subtypes, disease-associated states, or transcriptomic changes in vascular cells suggests that, in contrast to glia and neurons, the vascular compartment is relatively stable in this brain region and disease context. This finding aligns with prior unbiased single-nucleus studies, reinforcing the notion that vascular dysfunction may not be a primary driver of PD pathology in the SNpc, or that such changes are below the detection threshold of current single-nucleus approaches.

Open questions remain regarding the potential for subtle endothelial or blood-brain barrier dysfunction in other brain regions, or in genetic/atypical forms of PD. The absence of subclustering may reflect technical limitations or true biological homogeneity in this region. Future studies could employ targeted enrichment, higher-resolution spatial methods, or functional assays to further probe vascular cell diversity and function in PD. The findings do not contradict prior models, but rather fill a gap by providing a robust negative result for vascular cell involvement in sporadic PD SNpc. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

# summary for Mathys 2019 (endothelial and vascular cells)

1) **Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This study (Mathys et al., 2019, Nature) performed single-nucleus RNA-seq on 80,660 nuclei from the prefrontal cortex of 48 individuals with varying Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. Endothelial and vascular cells (including pericytes) were identified as rare populations (0.2% each), marked by FLT1 and AMBP, respectively. No significant AD-associated transcriptional or compositional changes were reported for these vascular cell types, and no distinct disease-associated endothelial or pericyte subpopulations were identified. The main findings for these cells are their robust identification and annotation, with no evidence for major AD-related perturbation in this dataset. <keyFinding priority='3'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

- Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
</metadata>

<methods>
This study used droplet-based single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to profile 80,660 nuclei from the prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 10) of 48 individuals from the ROSMAP cohorts, spanning a spectrum of AD pathology. Cell types were annotated using canonical marker genes, and sub-clustering was performed for all major cell types. Endothelial cells were identified by FLT1 expression, and pericytes by AMBP. The analysis included rigorous quality control and cross-validation with bulk RNA-seq and immunohistochemistry, but endothelial and pericyte populations were too rare for robust differential expression or sub-clustering analyses.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Identification**  
Endothelial and vascular cells (including pericytes) were robustly identified as rare populations, each constituting approximately 0.2% of all nuclei (see Fig. 2c, Extended Data Fig. 3a, b). Endothelial cells were marked by FLT1 and CLDN5, while pericytes were marked by AMBP. The proportions of these cell types were consistent across individuals and matched previous single-nucleus datasets from adult human cortex, supporting the reliability of their annotation. <keyFinding priority='3'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**  
The study performed systematic differential expression analysis for all major cell types. However, due to the low abundance of endothelial and pericyte nuclei, these populations were explicitly excluded from differential gene expression analyses and sub-clustering (see Methods: "Owing to their low cell counts, pericyte and endothelial cell populations were excluded from differential analyses."). As a result, no AD-associated differentially expressed genes or altered pathways were reported for these vascular cell types. <keyFinding priority='3'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization**  
No distinct subtypes or disease-associated states were identified for endothelial or pericyte cells. The main analysis focused on neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and oligodendrocyte precursor cells, where multiple subpopulations and disease-associated states were described. For endothelial and pericyte cells, only their robust identification and annotation based on marker genes (FLT1, CLDN5 for endothelial; AMBP for pericytes) were reported. <keyFinding priority='3'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators & Metrics**  
No quantitative changes in the proportion of endothelial or pericyte cells were reported between AD-pathology and no-pathology groups. There was no evidence for modulation by age, sex, APOE genotype, or pathology burden for these cell types in this dataset. <keyFinding priority='3'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Gene Regulatory Networks, Cell-Cell Communication, Spatial Analysis**  
No analyses of gene regulatory networks, ligand-receptor interactions, or spatial/morphological validation were reported for endothelial or pericyte cells. The study did not present in situ or immunohistochemical validation for these vascular populations, focusing such efforts on glial and neuronal subtypes.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories, Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**  
No pseudotime or trajectory analyses were performed for endothelial or pericyte cells, and no integration with genetic risk or multi-omic data was reported for these populations.

**Summary Statement**  
Overall, the study robustly identified endothelial and pericyte cells as rare but distinct populations in the aged human prefrontal cortex using canonical markers. However, due to their low abundance, no significant AD-associated transcriptional changes, subtypes, or disease associations were detected or reported for these vascular cell types. The main findings for these cells are their reliable annotation and the absence of evidence for major AD-related perturbation in this dataset. <keyFinding priority='3'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
No disease-specific roles, mechanistic insights, or biomarker/therapeutic implications were proposed for endothelial or vascular cells in this study. The absence of significant findings for these cell types suggests that, within the limits of this dataset, endothelial and pericyte transcriptional profiles are not detectably altered in AD, or that such changes are below the detection threshold due to low cell numbers. <keyFinding priority='3'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</clinical>

---

3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

The robust identification of endothelial and pericyte cells in this large snRNA-seq dataset confirms the feasibility of profiling vascular cell types in post-mortem human cortex. However, the absence of significant AD-associated transcriptional changes or subtypes for these populations highlights a key limitation: their low abundance in droplet-based single-nucleus datasets restricts the power to detect subtle or rare disease-associated states. This study does not contradict prior reports of vascular dysfunction in AD, but rather underscores the need for targeted enrichment or higher-throughput approaches to resolve endothelial and pericyte heterogeneity and their potential roles in neurodegeneration. Future studies should consider cell-type enrichment, spatial transcriptomics, or multi-omic integration to better characterize vascular contributions to AD pathology. The findings here are consistent with known classification schemes for vascular cells (FLT1, CLDN5, AMBP markers), but do not provide evidence for disease-associated endothelial or pericyte states in the prefrontal cortex at single-nucleus resolution. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

# summary for Mathys 2023 (endothelial and vascular cells)

1) **Quick Reference (Endothelial and Vascular Cells)**

This large-scale single-nucleus RNA-seq study of 2.3 million nuclei from 427 aged human prefrontal cortices (Mathys et al., 2023, Cell) provides a comprehensive atlas of vascular cell types—including endothelial cells, pericytes, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts—but reports only modest or non-significant Alzheimer’s disease (AD)-associated transcriptional changes in these populations. No major disease-associated endothelial or vascular subtypes were identified, and cell proportion changes were not significant across AD progression or cognitive status. The study’s power to detect subtle changes in rare vascular cell types is limited by low cell numbers per individual.

Mathys H, Peng Z, Boix CA, et al. (2023). "Single-cell atlas reveals correlates of high cognitive function, dementia, and resilience to Alzheimer’s disease pathology." Cell 186, 4365–4385. Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD), cognitive impairment, and resilience.
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) was performed on prefrontal cortex tissue from 427 ROSMAP participants, spanning the full spectrum of AD pathology and cognitive impairment. After quality control, 2.3 million nuclei were analyzed. Cell types were annotated using marker genes and reference datasets. Differential gene expression was assessed using pseudobulk approaches, with validation in independent datasets and by in situ and immunohistochemical methods for selected findings.
</methods>

<findings>
The study provides a high-resolution atlas of 54 cell types, including several vascular populations: endothelial cells (End), smooth muscle cells (SMCs), fibroblasts (Fib), and pericytes (Per). Vascular and epithelial cells collectively comprised only 0.8% of all nuclei (17,974 cells), with endothelial cells forming a subset of this group.

**Cell Type Proportions:**  
The relative abundance of vascular cell types, including endothelial cells, did not significantly change with AD pathology progression, cognitive impairment, or resilience status. This was determined by both group-based and regression analyses (see Figure 7A–B and Data S1, pages 12A–12B). The authors note that the low frequency of vascular cells limited statistical power for detecting subtle compositional changes (<keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Differential Gene Expression:**  
Systematic differential expression analysis across 54 cell types revealed that, after correction for multiple testing and covariates, endothelial and other vascular cells exhibited few or no significant AD-associated gene expression changes. The heatmap in Figure 2A shows that the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in vascular cell types was minimal compared to neurons, glia, and immune cells. Most significant DEGs were found in neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia, with vascular cells largely unaffected (<keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Pathway Enrichment:**  
No major pathway enrichments or coordinated transcriptional programs were reported for endothelial or vascular cells in association with AD pathology, cognitive function, or resilience. In contrast, neurons and glia showed robust changes in synaptic, metabolic, and DNA damage response pathways.

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
The study annotated vascular cell types using canonical markers (see Figure S1I), but did not identify disease-associated subtypes or states within the endothelial or vascular populations. No evidence was presented for homeostatic versus disease-associated endothelial states, nor for transitions along AD or aging trajectories. The authors did not report spatial or morphological validation for vascular subtypes.

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
No significant effects of host factors (age, sex, APOE genotype, diabetes, or vascular pathology) on endothelial or vascular cell gene expression were reported after correction for AD pathology. Diabetes was noted to have a cell-type-specific effect in oligodendrocytes, but not in vascular cells.

**Gene Regulatory Networks & Cell-Cell Communication:**  
No major findings were reported for gene regulatory networks, transcription factors, or ligand-receptor interactions involving endothelial or vascular cells in the context of AD.

**Spatial Analysis:**  
No spatial transcriptomic or in situ validation was performed for vascular cell subtypes.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
No evidence was found for stage-specific shifts or pseudotime trajectories in vascular cells.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
No eQTL or genetic risk variant associations were reported for endothelial or vascular cell subtypes.

The authors explicitly acknowledge that the low abundance of vascular cells in snRNA-seq datasets limits the power to detect subtle or rare disease-associated states in these populations. They caution that the number of DEGs detected in rare cell types is likely underestimated (<keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

</findings>

<clinical>
The study does not identify any endothelial or vascular cell subtypes as major contributors to AD pathology, cognitive decline, or resilience. No mechanistic or biomarker implications are proposed for these cell types. The findings suggest that, within the limits of current snRNA-seq technology and sample size, vascular cell transcriptional changes are not a prominent feature of AD in the aged human prefrontal cortex. However, the authors note that further studies with greater sampling depth or targeted enrichment may be required to fully assess the role of vascular cells in AD (<keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).
</clinical>

---

3) **Research Implications**

This study provides a valuable reference atlas for vascular cell types in the aged human prefrontal cortex but highlights the technical limitations of snRNA-seq for rare populations such as endothelial and other vascular cells. The lack of significant AD-associated transcriptional changes or compositional shifts in these populations suggests that, at least in this brain region and cohort, vascular cell-intrinsic responses are not a dominant feature of AD pathology. However, the authors explicitly caution that low cell numbers per individual reduce power to detect subtle or rare disease-associated states, and that the number of DEGs in vascular cells is likely underestimated. No novel endothelial subtypes or disease-associated states were identified, and the findings are consistent with prior reports of limited vascular cell representation in single-nucleus datasets. Future studies employing targeted enrichment, spatial transcriptomics, or single-cell multi-omics may be required to resolve the contribution of vascular cells to AD pathogenesis and resilience. No explicit contradictions with prior vascular cell studies are discussed in the paper (<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

Single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) was performed on 1.3 million nuclei from 283 post-mortem samples across six brain regions (entorhinal cortex [EC], hippocampus [HC], anterior thalamus [TH], angular gyrus [AG], midtemporal cortex [MT], prefrontal cortex [PFC]) from 48 individuals (26 AD, 22 non-AD). Vascular and endothelial cells were annotated as a major cell class ("vasculature/epithelia"). Validation included in situ hybridization and cross-dataset comparisons.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Regional Distribution**
Endothelial and vascular cells (termed "vasculature/epithelia") comprised 2.4% of all nuclei (33,198 cells). Their abundance varied modestly across regions, but no statistically significant region-specific enrichment or depletion was reported for this class in the main text or supplementary figures. The overall fraction of vascular cells showed a slight, non-significant increase in AD (odds ratio [OR] = 1.24), mainly in EC, HC, and PFC, especially in late AD (<keyFinding priority='2'>Vascular cell proportion is mildly increased in late-stage AD, but this effect is not robust or regionally specific.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Subtype Identification and Characterization**
The study annotated vascular/epithelial cells as a major class but did not further subdivide them into molecularly distinct endothelial, pericyte, or other vascular subtypes in the main figures or text. No detailed marker gene lists, functional programs, or spatial validation for endothelial or vascular subtypes are provided in the main or extended data figures. The only mention of vascular subtypes is in the methods, where pericytes, smooth muscle cells (SMC), fibroblasts, and endothelial cells are listed as minor classes, but no region- or disease-specific findings are described for these subtypes.

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**
No significant AD-associated differential gene expression (DEG) programs or pathway enrichments are reported for vascular or endothelial cells in the main text or figures. The extended data and supplementary tables do not highlight any vascular-specific modules or DEGs associated with AD pathology, Braak stage, or cognitive resilience. There is no evidence for disease-associated activation, inflammation, or barrier dysfunction signatures in the vascular/epithelial compartment in this dataset.

**Modulators & Metrics**
No associations are reported between vascular cell states and host factors (age, sex, APOE genotype), nor are any quantitative activation or morphology metrics described for this cell class.

**Gene Regulatory Networks and Cell-Cell Communication**
No vascular/endothelial-specific gene regulatory networks or ligand-receptor interactions are highlighted as altered in AD. The main cell-cell communication findings focus on neuronal and glial interactions.

**Spatial Analysis**
No in situ or morphological validation is presented for vascular or endothelial subtypes.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**
No evidence is provided for temporal or stage-specific transitions in vascular or endothelial cell states in AD.

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**
This large-scale single-nucleus RNA-seq study of six brain regions in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) identifies vascular/epithelial cells (including endothelial and related types) as a stable, minor population (~2.4% of nuclei) with no significant region- or disease-specific subtypes or transcriptional programs. Vascular cell proportions are mildly increased in late-stage AD, but without robust statistical or functional support. No disease-associated gene expression changes, functional modules, or spatial/morphological alterations are reported for endothelial or vascular cells, and no genetic or demographic modulators are identified.

---

**Research Implications (≈150 words):**
The absence of significant findings for endothelial and vascular cells in this comprehensive multi-region AD atlas suggests that, at the transcriptomic level and with current snRNA-seq sensitivity, these cell types do not undergo major compositional or molecular changes in AD, at least in the sampled regions and disease stages. This contrasts with some prior reports of vascular dysfunction in AD, but the authors do not explicitly discuss such discrepancies. The lack of subtype resolution (e.g., distinguishing endothelial from pericyte or SMC states) may reflect technical limitations or the relatively low abundance of these cells in the dataset. Future studies with targeted enrichment, higher sequencing depth, or spatial transcriptomics may be required to resolve subtle or regionally restricted vascular changes in AD. The findings here do not support a primary role for vascular cell-intrinsic transcriptional alterations in AD pathogenesis, but do not exclude functional or post-transcriptional contributions.

# summary for Miyoshi 2024 (endothelial and vascular cells)

1) **Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This study provides a comprehensive spatial and single-nucleus transcriptomic analysis of Alzheimer’s disease (AD), including sporadic AD (sAD), Down syndrome-associated AD (DSAD), and the 5xFAD mouse model, with a focus on the human frontal cortex and posterior cingulate cortex. Endothelial and vascular cells—including arterial, capillary, pericyte, smooth muscle, and fibroblast subtypes—showed disease- and region-specific transcriptomic changes. Notably, vascular and glial gene signatures were upregulated in gray matter regions in early AD, with sex differences (female-enriched inflammatory/vascular signatures). Pathway analyses highlighted dysregulation in angiogenesis, blood–brain barrier (BBB) transport, and VEGF signaling, with ANGPTL4 upregulation in astrocytes and altered cell–cell communication involving vascular cells. These changes were modulated by disease stage, sex, and amyloid pathology.

<methods>
- Single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST, 10x Genomics Visium) were performed on postmortem human frontal cortex (FCX) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) from controls, early-stage AD, late-stage AD, and DSAD (total n=55 for snRNA-seq; n=39 for ST).
- Mouse 5xFAD and wild-type brains were profiled at 4, 6, 8, and 12 months.
- Vascular cell subtypes were annotated using canonical markers and unbiased clustering; spatial and cell-type-specific gene expression was validated with imaging mass cytometry (IMC) and immunofluorescence.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Subtypes**
Endothelial and vascular cells were robustly identified in both snRNA-seq and ST datasets, including arterial endothelial cells (SOX2+), capillary endothelial cells, transport pericytes (CKB+), extracellular matrix pericytes, smooth muscle cells (SMCs), perivascular fibroblasts, and meningeal fibroblasts. These subtypes were annotated based on established markers and spatial localization.

Quantitative changes in vascular cell proportions were observed:
- Disease-associated shifts in vascular cell abundance were detected, particularly in gray matter (GM) regions and in early-stage AD and DSAD, as shown by differential abundance analysis (<keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).
- Vascular and glial cell marker genes were disproportionately upregulated in spatial DEGs from GM clusters (L1–L6b), especially in early AD and DSAD, suggesting early vascular involvement in disease (<keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**
- Vascular cell marker genes were among the most upregulated in spatial DEGs in disease, particularly in upper and deep cortical layers.
- Pathway enrichment analyses of upregulated genes in both late-stage AD and DSAD highlighted:
  - Angiogenesis and vasculature development
  - Vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation
  - Endothelial cell migration
  - VEGF receptor signaling
  - Blood–brain barrier (BBB) transport
  - Response to amyloid-β and hypoxia
(<keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

- Downregulated pathways in vascular cells included water homeostasis and cholesterol biosynthetic processes, suggesting BBB and metabolic dysfunction.

**Cell Subtype Characterization**
- **Arterial and Capillary Endothelial Cells:** Expressed SOX2 and other canonical markers; upregulated genes related to angiogenesis and endothelial migration in disease, especially in DSAD and late-stage AD.
- **Pericytes (T-pericyte, M-pericyte):** Showed upregulation of genes involved in BBB transport and actin cytoskeleton organization; pericyte marker genes were among spatial DEGs in disease clusters.
- **Smooth Muscle Cells (SMCs):** Upregulated genes related to vascular SMC proliferation and response to cAMP in disease.
- **Fibroblasts (Perivascular, Meningeal):** Enriched for extracellular matrix and actin filament organization genes; upregulated in disease, particularly in DSAD.

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**
- IMC confirmed increased expression of vascular proteins (e.g., CL-P1, CD44, Cystatin C) in vascular and perivascular clusters in late-stage AD and DSAD.
- Spatial transcriptomics revealed that vascular gene expression changes were regionally restricted, with the strongest effects in upper cortical layers and GM.

**Sex Differences and Modulators**
- Female samples showed broad upregulation of vascular and glial genes, with enrichment for inflammation, oxidative stress, and glucose metabolism pathways in vascular cells, independent of brain region (<keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).
- Male DEGs in vascular cells were more related to cytoskeletal organization and alternative splicing.

**Cell–Cell Communication**

  - ANGPTL4 (angiopoietin-like 4) signaling was upregulated in astrocytes and vascular cells in DSAD, confirmed by immunofluorescence (<keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).
  - CD99 signaling, involving endothelial cells, was downregulated in DSAD.
  - NECTIN signaling, important for synapse maintenance and also expressed in vascular cells, was diminished in DSAD.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**
- In the 5xFAD mouse model, vascular gene expression changes increased with age and amyloid burden, paralleling human disease progression.
- Vascular modules were moderately preserved across species, with some differences in the strength and timing of changes.

**Genetic and Multi-omic Integration**
- Some vascular module hub genes (e.g., CLU, CD44) overlapped with AD GWAS loci and were upregulated in both human and mouse amyloid-associated regions.

</findings>

<clinical>
Endothelial and vascular cells in AD and DSAD exhibit early and regionally specific transcriptomic changes, particularly in GM and upper cortical layers, implicating angiogenesis, BBB dysfunction, and altered cell–cell signaling in disease pathogenesis. The upregulation of ANGPTL4 in astrocytes and vascular cells, and the disruption of endothelial signaling pathways (e.g., CD99, NECTIN), suggest that vascular dysfunction may contribute to neuroinflammation, impaired BBB integrity, and amyloid pathology. These findings highlight vascular cell states as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets, especially in genetically at-risk populations (e.g., DSAD) and in females, who show stronger vascular/inflammatory signatures. However, most associations are cross-sectional and require further functional validation.

3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study advances the understanding of endothelial and vascular cell heterogeneity in AD by integrating spatial and single-nucleus transcriptomics with proteomic and imaging validation. The identification of early, region-specific vascular gene expression changes—particularly in upper cortical layers and in DSAD—supports a model in which vascular dysfunction is an early and potentially driving event in AD pathogenesis. The upregulation of ANGPTL4 and disruption of endothelial signaling pathways (CD99, NECTIN) provide mechanistic links between vascular cells, astrocytes, and neuroinflammation. These findings align with, but also extend, previous models of BBB breakdown and vascular contribution to dementia, emphasizing the importance of spatial context and genetic risk (e.g., DSAD, sex differences). Open questions include the causal role of these vascular changes in disease progression, their reversibility, and their potential as therapeutic targets. The study’s cross-sectional design and reliance on postmortem tissue limit causal inference, and future work should include longitudinal and functional studies. No explicit contradictions with prior vascular models were discussed by the authors (<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

# summary for Nagy 2020 (endothelial and vascular cells)

<quickReference>
This single-nucleus RNA-seq study of human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in major depressive disorder (MDD) identified a single endothelial cell cluster ("Endo") with canonical markers (CLDN5, VTN) and found only two differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in this population between MDD cases and controls. The magnitude of transcriptional changes in endothelial cells was minimal compared to other cell types, and no endothelial subtypes or disease-associated states were reported. Of the two DEGs, one (FADS2) is previously associated with depression. No significant changes in endothelial cell proportions or strong modulation by clinical or genetic factors were observed.

Disease focus: Major depressive disorder (MDD)
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) was performed on ~80,000 nuclei from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA9) of 17 male MDD cases and 17 matched controls. Unsupervised clustering identified 26 cell populations, including one endothelial cluster. Differential expression was assessed within each cluster. Validation included FANS-qPCR and RNAScope for selected genes, but not for endothelial-specific findings.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Identification:**  
A single endothelial cell cluster ("Endo") was identified, annotated by canonical markers CLDN5 and VTN. The number of endothelial nuclei was not specified in detail, but the cluster was present in both cases and controls. No significant difference in the proportion of endothelial cells between MDD and controls was reported (<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>).

**Subtype Heterogeneity:**  
No subtypes or distinct endothelial cell states were identified. The study did not report further subdivision of the endothelial population, nor did it describe any disease-associated or homeostatic endothelial subpopulations. The cluster was defined solely by established endothelial markers (<keyFinding priority='3'>No evidence for endothelial subtypes or disease-associated states in this dataset.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Differential Gene Expression:**  
Only two genes were differentially expressed in the endothelial cluster between MDD and controls (FDR < 0.10). The main DEG highlighted is FADS2, which is previously associated with depression in genetic studies. The direction of change (up/down) for FADS2 in endothelial cells is not explicitly stated in the main text, but the gene is listed as a DEG in the Endo cluster (see Fig. 3f). The second DEG is not named in the main text, and no further functional annotation is provided for these genes in the endothelial context (<keyFinding priority='2'>Minimal transcriptional changes in endothelial cells in MDD, with FADS2 as a notable DEG.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Pathway Enrichment and Functional Implications:**  
No pathway enrichment or functional signature is described for the endothelial cluster, likely due to the very small number of DEGs. The study does not report any endothelial-specific pathway alterations (e.g., blood-brain barrier, angiogenesis, inflammation) in MDD (<keyFinding priority='3'>No evidence for altered endothelial pathways in MDD in this dataset.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Spatial/Morphological Validation:**  
No spatial, morphological, or in situ validation was performed for endothelial findings. The study did not use immunostaining or RNAScope for endothelial markers or DEGs.

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
No significant modulation of endothelial gene expression or abundance by age, sex (all male cohort), antidepressant exposure, or other clinical variables was reported. No genetic or host factors were linked to endothelial changes.

**Cell-Cell Communication:**  
The study's cell-cell interaction analysis focused on excitatory neurons and OPCs, not endothelial cells. No ligand-receptor or cross-talk findings involving endothelial cells were reported.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
No pseudotime or trajectory analysis was performed for endothelial cells.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
FADS2, one of the two DEGs in endothelial cells, is a gene previously associated with depression in GWAS, but the study does not provide endothelial-specific genetic integration or eQTL analysis.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
The study provides little evidence for a direct role of endothelial or vascular cells in the pathophysiology of MDD at the transcriptional level in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The minimal number of DEGs and lack of pathway enrichment suggest that, in contrast to OPCs and excitatory neurons, endothelial cells do not exhibit major disease-associated transcriptional changes in this brain region in MDD. The identification of FADS2 as a DEG is notable given its prior genetic association with depression, but the functional significance in endothelial cells remains unclear. No therapeutic or biomarker implications for endothelial cells are proposed.
</clinical>
</detailedSummary>

<researchImplications>
This study suggests that, in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex of male MDD subjects, endothelial and vascular cells show minimal transcriptional response compared to other cell types, with no evidence for disease-associated endothelial subtypes or major pathway alterations. The lack of endothelial heterogeneity or activation states contrasts with findings in some neurodegenerative or inflammatory brain disorders, where vascular dysfunction is more prominent. The identification of FADS2 as a DEG in endothelial cells is intriguing but not mechanistically explored. Future studies could address whether other brain regions, female subjects, or more targeted vascular profiling (e.g., spatial transcriptomics, blood-brain barrier assays) reveal endothelial contributions to MDD. The findings are consistent with prior bulk and single-cell studies that have not highlighted endothelial cells as primary drivers of MDD pathology, but do not rule out subtle or region-specific vascular involvement. No explicit conflicts with prior endothelial-focused MDD models are discussed by the authors.

Disease focus: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on primary motor cortex (MCX, BA4) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC, BA9) from 73 donors (ALS, FTLD, and controls). 625,973 nuclei were profiled and annotated into 44 transcriptionally distinct subpopulations, including detailed vascular (endothelial and mural) cell subtypes. Validation included immunofluorescence and immunohistochemistry for key vascular markers.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Subtypes**
Endothelial and vascular cells were robustly recovered and annotated into arterial, venous, and capillary endothelial subtypes, as well as mural (smooth muscle, pericyte) and fibroblast populations (see Figure 1D/E, S1). These subtypes were reproducible across donors, regions, and disease groups. No major shifts in overall endothelial cell abundance were reported, but the study focused on transcriptional and functional changes.

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**
In ALS (and to a lesser extent FTLD), MCX endothelial cells showed significant downregulation of genes encoding tight and adherens junction proteins (e.g., CLDN5, PECAM1, RAPGEF3, MICALL2), as well as brain endothelial-enriched transcription factors (LMO2, PPARD, TSC22D1) and transporters (MFSD2A, TFRC). Immune response genes (IRAK3, HLA-E) were also reduced. These changes were largely specific to the MCX in ALS, with little evidence for similar alterations in the PFC. <keyFinding priority='1'>This pattern suggests region- and disease-specific impairment of blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity in ALS motor cortex.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell Subtype Characterization**
- **Endothelial Subtypes**: Arterial, venous, and capillary endothelial cells were annotated using canonical markers (see Table S2). Disease-associated transcriptional changes were most pronounced in MCX capillary and arterial endothelial cells in ALS.
- **Mural Cells**: Smooth muscle and pericyte subtypes were identified, but the main findings centered on endothelial dysfunction.
- **Fibroblasts**: Present but not a focus of disease-related findings.

**Functional and Morphological Validation**
- **Arp2/3 Complex (ARPC3)**: ARPC3, a subunit of the actin-related protein complex critical for junctional integrity, was downregulated in MCX endothelial cells in ALS. Immunofluorescence confirmed marked depletion of vascular ArpC3 protein in ALS MCX endothelium (p=0.003), with no change in overall vessel density. <keyFinding priority='1'>Loss of ArpC3 is linked to impaired tight/adherens junction formation and BBB breakdown.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **Junctional Protein Localization**: Immunofluorescence for claudin-5 (CLDN5) and VE-cadherin (CDH5) showed diminished junctional localization of claudin-5 in ALS MCX microvessels (p=0.038), with a trend for VE-cadherin (p=0.077). This supports mislocalization of junctional proteins as a mechanism for BBB dysfunction. <keyFinding priority='2'>Spatial validation confirms transcriptional findings of junctional disruption.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **HLA-E Downregulation**: HLA-E, an MHC class I antigen and NK cell inhibitor, was among the most downregulated endothelial genes in ALS and FTLD. Protein expression was reduced in ALS MCX endothelium (p=0.010). <keyFinding priority='2'>Loss of HLA-E may facilitate NK cell-mediated BBB breakdown and neuroinflammation.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Pathway Analysis**
GO and KEGG enrichment highlighted loss of endothelial junctional integrity, cytoskeletal organization, and immune regulation in ALS MCX endothelium. No major upregulation of inflammatory or reactive endothelial signatures was reported.

**Modulators & Metrics**
No specific genetic or demographic modifiers (e.g., APOE, sex, age) were highlighted as drivers of vascular changes. The findings were consistent across sporadic and C9orf72 ALS.

**Cell-Cell Communication**
No direct ligand-receptor or cross-talk analyses were reported for endothelial cells, but the loss of HLA-E implicates altered immune-endothelial interactions.

**Spatial Analysis**
Immunofluorescence and quantification of vascular markers provided strong spatial validation of transcriptomic findings.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**
No pseudotime or trajectory analyses were performed for vascular cells.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**
No eQTL or GWAS integration specific to endothelial subtypes was reported.

</findings>

<clinical>
The study provides strong evidence that endothelial and vascular dysfunction—specifically, loss of tight/adherens junction gene expression, depletion of Arp2/3 complex, and downregulation/mislocalization of claudin-5 and HLA-E—are prominent features of ALS motor cortex, but not prefrontal cortex or FTLD. These changes likely contribute to BBB breakdown, facilitating neuroinflammation and potentially allowing peripheral immune cell infiltration. The loss of HLA-E may further enable NK cell-mediated vascular injury. While causality cannot be established from cross-sectional data, these findings suggest that vascular impairment is a non-cell-autonomous driver of ALS pathogenesis and may represent a therapeutic target for restoring BBB integrity or modulating neuroimmune interactions. <keyFinding priority='1'>Endothelial dysfunction is a convergent, region-specific signature in ALS, with potential implications for biomarker development and intervention.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</clinical>

---

**Quick Reference**

Endothelial and vascular cells in ALS motor cortex show marked downregulation of tight/adherens junction genes (e.g., CLDN5, PECAM1), depletion of Arp2/3 complex (ARPC3), and loss/mislocalization of claudin-5 and HLA-E, validated by immunofluorescence. These changes are region- and disease-specific (ALS MCX), suggesting impaired BBB integrity and increased susceptibility to neuroinflammation, with HLA-E loss potentially enabling NK cell-mediated injury. No major genetic or demographic drivers were identified.

---

**Research Implications**

This study establishes a robust, region-specific signature of endothelial dysfunction in ALS motor cortex, characterized by loss of junctional gene expression, cytoskeletal regulators, and immune modulators. The findings align with prior reports of BBB breakdown in ALS but provide single-cell and spatial resolution, confirming that these changes are not generalized across cortex or FTLD. The identification of HLA-E loss as a potential mechanism for NK cell-mediated vascular injury is novel and warrants further investigation. Open questions include whether these vascular changes precede or follow neuronal degeneration, their reversibility, and their potential as therapeutic targets. The study does not report major endothelial subtype-specific differences beyond the MCX/PFC dichotomy, nor does it identify genetic risk factors driving vascular changes, highlighting the need for future work integrating eQTL and longitudinal data. No explicit contradictions with prior models are discussed; rather, the findings reinforce and extend the concept of vascular impairment as a key non-cell-autonomous contributor to ALS pathogenesis.

Disease focus: Parkinson’s disease (PD)
</metadata>

<methods>
This study generated single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data from 100 postmortem human donors (75 PD, 25 controls), sampling five brain regions: dorsal motor nucleus of the Xth nerve (DMNX), globus pallidus interna (GPI), primary motor cortex (PMC), dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC), and primary visual cortex (PVC). Nuclei were isolated, hashed, and sequenced using 10x Genomics 3’ v3.1 chemistry. Data underwent rigorous quality control, batch correction, and clustering using SCANPY and Pegasus, with cell type annotation based on marker genes and reference datasets.  
</methods>

<findings>
The dataset comprises 2,096,155 high-quality nuclei, with robust representation across all five brain regions and both disease and control groups. UMAP visualization and clustering identified nine major cell types, including endothelial and mural (vascular) cells, as expected for the sampled brain regions.

**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Endothelial and mural cells were consistently detected as distinct clusters in the integrated dataset (see Fig. 3g, Fig. 6). The study notes that regions affected early in PD (e.g., DMNX, GPI) yielded fewer total nuclei, but there is no specific mention of significant changes in the proportion of endothelial or mural cells between PD and control samples, nor across Braak stages. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
The paper does not report further subclustering or identification of distinct endothelial or mural cell subtypes beyond the major class-level annotation. No disease-associated, homeostatic, or intermediate endothelial subpopulations are described. Marker genes used for annotation are not explicitly listed for endothelial or mural cells in the main text, but standard markers (e.g., CLDN5, PECAM1 for endothelium; PDGFRB for mural cells) are implied by reference to established datasets. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression & Pathway Enrichment:**  
No specific differential gene expression results, pathway enrichment, or regulatory network analyses are reported for endothelial or mural cells in relation to PD status, Braak stage, genotype, or other clinical variables. The focus of the manuscript is on dataset generation, quality control, and broad cell type annotation, rather than in-depth analysis of cell-type-specific disease mechanisms. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Spatial Analysis & Validation:**  
No spatial transcriptomics, in situ hybridization, or immunostaining validation is presented for endothelial or mural cell subtypes. Morphological or spatial heterogeneity of vascular cells is not discussed.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
The study design enables analysis of disease progression (Braak staging), but no temporal or pseudotime modeling of endothelial or mural cell states is reported.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
Although WGS data are available, the manuscript does not present eQTL, GWAS, or multi-omic integration analyses specific to endothelial or mural cells.

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
No quantitative activation scores, morphology metrics, or host/genetic modifiers are reported for endothelial or mural cells.

The study provides a foundational resource for exploring the molecular landscape of PD across multiple brain regions and cell types. However, for endothelial and mural cells, no disease-specific roles, mechanistic insights, or biomarker/therapeutic implications are proposed in this Data Descriptor. The dataset enables future hypothesis-driven analyses but does not itself report evidence for vascular cell involvement in PD pathogenesis. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</clinical>

**Research Implications**

This dataset represents the largest multi-region snRNA-seq resource for Parkinson’s disease to date, with robust annotation of major cell types, including endothelial and mural cells. However, the current publication does not provide in-depth analysis of vascular cell heterogeneity, disease-associated subtypes, or transcriptional changes in PD. Open questions remain regarding whether endothelial or mural cells exhibit region-specific vulnerability, altered gene expression, or functional changes in PD brains. The lack of reported subclustering or differential expression for these cell types means that future studies—leveraging this dataset—are needed to address these gaps. The resource is well-suited for such analyses, and the authors’ annotation approach is consistent with established classification schemes, but no conflicts or departures from prior vascular cell models are discussed. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

# summary for Reiner 2021 (endothelial and vascular cells)

1) **Quick Reference (Endothelial and Vascular Cells in Schizophrenia snRNA-seq, Reiner et al., 2021)**  
Single-nucleus RNA-seq of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia (Reiner et al., 2021) identified 20 transcriptomic cell populations, but found that nearly all differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were restricted to neuronal subtypes, with minimal or no significant transcriptomic alterations reported in endothelial or vascular cells. No major disease-associated endothelial subtypes or marker gene shifts were highlighted, and the study did not report genotype or demographic drivers for vascular cell states.

Disease focus: Schizophrenia
</metadata>

<methods>
This study employed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on approximately 275,000 nuclei isolated from frozen postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) samples. The cohort included 12 male individuals with schizophrenia and 14 male controls. The analysis aimed to resolve cell-type-specific transcriptomic changes associated with schizophrenia, with clustering yielding 20 distinct transcriptomic cell populations. Downstream analyses included differential gene expression, pathway enrichment, and regulatory network inference.
</methods>

<findings>
The primary finding of this study is that schizophrenia-associated transcriptomic alterations are highly cell-type specific and overwhelmingly concentrated in neuronal populations. Out of 4,766 differential expression events (DEGs) identified across 2,994 unique genes, approximately 96% were localized to five neuronal cell types. These neuronal subtypes exhibited enrichment for genes associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder GWAS loci, and further analyses implicated cell-type-specific gene ontologies and regulatory factors.

In contrast, the study reports minimal or no significant differential gene expression in non-neuronal populations, including endothelial and vascular cells. Although the clustering approach identified 20 transcriptomic cell populations—presumably encompassing canonical glial (astrocyte, oligodendrocyte, microglia) and vascular (endothelial, pericyte, smooth muscle) types—there is no mention in the abstract of any endothelial or vascular cell cluster exhibiting significant disease-associated transcriptomic changes. The authors explicitly state that nearly all DEGs were found in neuronal cell types, implying that endothelial and vascular cells did not show robust or statistically significant alterations in gene expression in schizophrenia within the sampled DLPFC tissue.

No distinct endothelial or vascular subtypes, marker gene shifts, or functional pathway changes are described for these cell types. There is also no report of changes in the proportion of endothelial or vascular cells between schizophrenia and control samples, nor any spatial or morphological validation of vascular cell states. The study does not discuss modulators such as age, sex, or genetic risk factors (e.g., GWAS loci, APOE) in relation to endothelial or vascular cell populations.

The absence of findings for endothelial and vascular cells is notable given the comprehensive single-nucleus profiling and the large number of nuclei analyzed. This suggests that, at least in the DLPFC and within the resolution and statistical power of this study, endothelial and vascular transcriptomic alterations are not a prominent feature of schizophrenia pathology.

</findings>

<clinical>
The lack of significant transcriptomic changes in endothelial and vascular cells suggests that, in the DLPFC, these cell types may not play a primary or direct role in the molecular pathology of schizophrenia as detected by snRNA-seq. The findings imply that disease mechanisms in this brain region are predominantly neuronal, at least at the level of steady-state gene expression. This does not exclude possible roles for vascular dysfunction in other brain regions, at other disease stages, or at the level of protein, epigenetic, or functional changes not captured by transcriptomics. The absence of endothelial or vascular cell involvement in this dataset limits immediate therapeutic or biomarker implications for these cell types in schizophrenia, based on the evidence presented.
</clinical>

---

3) **Research Implications**

The results from Reiner et al. (2021) indicate that, in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, endothelial and vascular cells do not exhibit major transcriptomic alterations in schizophrenia, in contrast to the pronounced changes observed in specific neuronal subtypes. This finding narrows the focus of future mechanistic and therapeutic studies toward neuronal populations in this brain region. However, it leaves open several questions: whether vascular or endothelial dysfunction might be present in other cortical or subcortical regions, at different disease stages, or detectable only through other modalities (e.g., proteomics, spatial transcriptomics, or functional assays). The absence of endothelial or vascular subtypes with disease-associated marker profiles in this study is consistent with some prior single-cell studies that also report limited glial or vascular involvement in schizophrenia DLPFC, but contrasts with findings in other neuropsychiatric or neurodegenerative disorders where vascular pathology is more prominent. The authors do not explicitly discuss conflicts with prior models, and the tag <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> is appropriate. Future studies with larger sample sizes, broader brain region coverage, or multi-omic integration may be required to fully rule out subtle or context-dependent vascular contributions to schizophrenia pathophysiology.

This study applied single-nucleus RNA-seq with allele-specific SNP mapping to mosaic human Rett syndrome brain and mouse models, enabling cell-type-resolved analysis of MECP2 mutation effects. Endothelial and vascular cells were identified as a distinct cluster but showed minimal transcriptomic changes between MECP2-mutant and wild-type nuclei, with no evidence for disease-associated subtypes or significant differential gene expression.

<methods>
The study used single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) on postmortem occipital cortex from three female Rett syndrome donors (MECP2 R255X mutation) and on visual cortex from mosaic female Mecp2+/– mice. A novel SNP-based approach enabled assignment of each nucleus to wild-type or mutant transcriptotype, allowing direct within-individual comparison. Cell types were identified by clustering and canonical marker gene expression. Endothelial and vascular cells were defined by expression of canonical markers (e.g., *CLDN5*).  
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Endothelial and vascular cells formed a discrete cluster in both mouse and human datasets, consistent with prior single-cell atlases.

No pathway enrichment, spatial, or morphological analyses were reported for endothelial/vascular cells. The study did not perform pseudotime or trajectory analysis for this cell type, nor did it report any spatial or in situ validation of vascular cell states.

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
No evidence was found for modulation of endothelial/vascular cell states by host factors (age, sex, X-inactivation skewing) or by MECP2 genotype. No activation or morphology scores were applied to this cell type.

**Gene Regulatory Networks, Cell-Cell Communication, and Multi-omic Integration:**  
No gene regulatory network analysis, ligand-receptor interaction, or eQTL/multi-omic integration was reported for endothelial/vascular cells.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>  
The authors do not discuss any findings in vascular cells that contradict prior literature or models. The absence of MECP2-dependent effects in this cell type is consistent with the known neuronal enrichment of MECP2 expression.

</findings>

<clinical>
The study provides no evidence for a direct role of endothelial or vascular cells in Rett syndrome pathophysiology, at least at the transcriptomic level detectable by snRNA-seq. The lack of disease-associated subtypes or gene expression changes suggests that MECP2 dysfunction does not cell-autonomously affect vascular cells in the human or mouse cortex.

---

**Research Implications**

The absence of MECP2-dependent transcriptional changes or disease-associated subtypes in endothelial and vascular cells in both mouse and human Rett syndrome brain suggests that these cells are not primary contributors to disease pathogenesis, at least at the level of steady-state gene expression. This finding aligns with the neuronal enrichment of MECP2 and supports a neuron-centric model of Rett syndrome. However, the study does not exclude the possibility of subtle, non-transcriptional, or non-cell-autonomous effects on the neurovascular unit, nor does it address potential changes in vascular function or blood-brain barrier integrity that might arise through indirect mechanisms. Future studies with higher sensitivity, spatial transcriptomics, or functional assays may be needed to fully rule out vascular contributions, especially in other brain regions or disease stages. The lack of vascular cell involvement is consistent with prior models and does not contradict existing literature. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Rexach JE, Cheng Y, Chen L, et al. Cross-disorder and disease-specific pathways in dementia revealed by single-cell genomics. Cell. 2024 Oct 3;187(19):5753–5774. doi:10.1016/j.cell.2024.08.019
Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD), behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) and ATAC-seq were performed on postmortem human brain tissue from 41 individuals (AD, bvFTD, PSP, and controls), sampling three cortical regions (insula [INS], primary motor cortex [BA4], and primary visual cortex [V1]) with variable vulnerability to tau pathology. Over 590,000 high-quality nuclei were analyzed after stringent QC. Endothelial and vascular cells (ENDs and pericytes) were identified and subclustered using canonical marker genes and reference-based mapping. Differential abundance and gene expression were assessed using linear mixed models, with validation by bulk RNA-seq deconvolution and chromatin accessibility (snATAC-seq).
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Identification**
Endothelial and vascular cells (ENDs and pericytes) were robustly identified across all brain regions and conditions. ENDs were further divided into 13 subclusters, hierarchically grouped into two major classes: (1) those with higher expression of immune signaling genes, and (2) those enriched for angiogenesis and endothelial maintenance genes (Figure S3F). Pericytes were also identified as a distinct canonical class.

Quantitative changes in the proportion of ENDs or pericytes were not a major feature of disease in this study. The pie chart in Figure 1D and Table S4 indicate that, among the 49 subclusters with significant compositional changes in disease, only a minority were ENDs or pericytes, and these changes were not highlighted as prominent or disease-specific. <keyFinding priority='3'>Endothelial and vascular cell proportions remained largely stable across AD, bvFTD, and PSP, with no major disease-specific depletion or enrichment reported.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**
Within ENDs, subclusters were defined by distinct marker genes:
- Immune signaling ENDs: upregulation of genes involved in immune response (not individually specified in the main text, but likely including canonical markers such as ICAM1, VCAM1, and cytokine receptors).
- Angiogenesis/maintenance ENDs: upregulation of genes such as VWF, FLT1, and other vascular maintenance factors.

No specific disease-associated END subtypes were highlighted as being uniquely enriched or depleted in AD, bvFTD, or PSP. <keyFinding priority='2'>The majority of differentially expressed genes in ENDs were shared across disorders, with only a small minority being disorder-specific.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Pathway analysis for ENDs and pericytes was not a major focus, and no strong enrichment for disease-relevant pathways (e.g., blood-brain barrier dysfunction, angiogenesis, or vascular inflammation) was reported as a distinguishing feature in any disorder. <keyFinding priority='3'>No evidence for major disease-specific activation of vascular or endothelial pathways in tauopathies was presented.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell State and Disease Association**
The systematic subclustering revealed that ENDs and pericytes maintain their canonical transcriptional identities across regions and disease states. There was no evidence for emergence of novel, disease-associated endothelial or pericyte states analogous to the disease-associated microglia or astrocyte states described in this study. <keyFinding priority='2'>Endothelial and vascular cells did not display the same degree of disease-associated heterogeneity or state transitions as glial or neuronal populations.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators & Metrics**
No significant modulation of END or pericyte states by host factors (age, sex, APOE, or GWAS variants) was reported. No quantitative activation or morphology scores were applied to these cell types.

**Gene Regulatory Networks and Cell-Cell Communication**
The study did not identify endothelial- or pericyte-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs) as major drivers of disease-associated changes. No prominent ligand-receptor interactions involving ENDs or pericytes were highlighted as altered in disease.

**Spatial Analysis and Validation**
No spatial or morphological validation (e.g., immunostaining or in situ hybridization) specific to END or pericyte subtypes was reported.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**
No evidence was presented for temporal or pseudotime shifts in END or pericyte states related to disease progression or aging.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**
No enrichment of AD, bvFTD, or PSP GWAS risk variants in END or pericyte marker genes was reported.

<keyFinding priority='1'>The principal finding is that, in contrast to glial and neuronal populations, endothelial and vascular cells show remarkable stability in both abundance and transcriptional state across tauopathies and controls.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
The study demonstrates that endothelial and vascular cells do not undergo major disease-specific compositional or transcriptional changes in AD, bvFTD, or PSP, in contrast to the pronounced glial and neuronal heterogeneity observed. This suggests that, at least in the cortical regions and disease stages sampled, vascular dysfunction is not a primary or distinguishing feature of these tauopathies at the single-nucleus transcriptomic level. There is no evidence from this dataset to support a direct mechanistic role for endothelial or pericyte subtypes in driving or mitigating tau pathology, nor are these cell types highlighted as promising therapeutic or biomarker targets in these disorders. <keyFinding priority='2'>The relative stability of endothelial and vascular cells may indicate that vascular contributions to dementia in these tauopathies are secondary or less prominent than glial/neuronal mechanisms.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**
Endothelial and vascular cells (ENDs and pericytes) in the human cortex display remarkable stability in both abundance and transcriptional state across Alzheimer’s disease, bvFTD, and PSP, as revealed by single-nucleus RNA-seq. Subtypes defined by immune signaling or angiogenesis/maintenance markers were present in all conditions, but no major disease-specific changes in proportion or gene expression were observed. Unlike glial and neuronal populations, ENDs and pericytes did not exhibit disease-associated heterogeneity or state transitions, and were not modulated by genetic or demographic risk factors. <keyFinding priority='1'>Vascular cell stability is a key cross-disorder finding.</keyFinding>

---

**Research Implications (≈150 words):**
This study provides strong evidence that, in contrast to glial and neuronal populations, endothelial and vascular cells in the cortex are largely unaffected at the transcriptomic level in major tauopathies. This finding aligns with some prior single-cell studies that have not identified prominent vascular signatures in AD or related dementias, but contrasts with models proposing a central role for blood-brain barrier dysfunction in neurodegeneration. The lack of disease-specific END or pericyte states suggests that vascular contributions to dementia may be more subtle, regionally restricted, or secondary to glial/neuronal pathology, at least in the sampled regions and disease stages. Open questions remain regarding whether vascular changes might be more prominent in other brain regions, at earlier or later disease stages, or in other forms of dementia (e.g., vascular dementia). The study’s findings argue against targeting endothelial or pericyte subtypes as primary therapeutic strategies in tauopathies, but do not exclude their involvement in other contexts. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

# summary for Ruzicka 2020 (endothelial and vascular cells)

1) **Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This large-scale single-nucleus RNA-seq study of human prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia (Ruzicka et al., 2020, medRxiv) identified 20 major cell types/states, including a distinct endothelial (Endo) population. Endothelial cells showed minimal schizophrenia-associated transcriptional changes, with no significant shifts in cell proportion or robust differentially expressed genes. There was no enrichment of schizophrenia GWAS loci or transcriptional pathology in endothelial cells, contrasting sharply with neuronal populations. The study’s findings suggest that, in this dataset, endothelial and vascular cells are not primary mediators of schizophrenia-associated molecular pathology, and their transcriptional profiles remain largely stable across disease and control groups.

- Disease focus: Schizophrenia
</metadata>

<methods>
This study performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on postmortem human prefrontal cortex (Brodmann Area 10) from 24 schizophrenia and 24 matched control subjects. Over 500,000 nuclei were profiled using the MULTI-seq multiplexing approach, and cell states were identified using the ACTIONet framework. Cell type annotations were validated with canonical marker genes, and differential expression was assessed using a pseudo-bulk approach with covariate adjustment. Spatial validation and GWAS integration were performed for prioritized findings.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Identification**  
Among the 20 major cell types/states annotated, a distinct endothelial (Endo) population was robustly identified based on canonical marker gene expression (e.g., CLDN5). Endothelial cells formed a discrete cluster in the ACTIONet cell-cell similarity network, consistent with prior human brain single-cell atlases. The proportion of endothelial cells did not differ significantly between schizophrenia and control groups, as shown in the cell-type composition plots (Fig. 1e, f), and there was no evidence of disease- or batch-driven clustering within this population. <keyFinding priority='3'>Endothelial cell proportions are stable across schizophrenia and control samples.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**  
The study’s primary focus was on neuronal populations, where thousands of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. In contrast, endothelial cells exhibited minimal transcriptional perturbation in schizophrenia. The volcano plots for non-neuronal populations (Extended Data Fig. 6c) show a lack of significant DEGs in the Endo cluster, with no genes reaching the thresholds for robust up- or downregulation. <keyFinding priority='2'>No significant schizophrenia-associated DEGs were detected in endothelial cells.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Pathway enrichment analyses, which revealed strong synaptic and neurodevelopmental signatures in neurons, did not identify any endothelial-specific pathways altered in schizophrenia. The curated set of neuronally-associated functional pathways (Fig. 2e) and the functional enrichment of transcriptional regulators (Fig. 4a) did not implicate endothelial or vascular processes.

**GWAS and Genetic Integration**  
A major result of the study was the mapping of schizophrenia GWAS loci to cell-type-specific DEGs. Of 145 GWAS loci, 68 were linked to DEGs in at least one cell type, predominantly neurons. The heatmap of GWAS locus-to-cell-type mapping (Fig. 3a) and the correlation plots (Fig. 3b) show that endothelial cells do not harbor significant genetic or transcriptional convergence for schizophrenia risk. <keyFinding priority='2'>Schizophrenia GWAS loci do not converge on endothelial cell DEGs.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Transcriptional Pathology Scores and Disease Association**  
The “transcriptional pathology score” (TPS), which quantifies the similarity of an individual’s cell-type-specific expression profile to the schizophrenia-associated signature, was markedly elevated in neuronal populations of schizophrenia cases but not in endothelial cells. The TPS distribution (Fig. 2c, Extended Data Fig. 4) shows no disease-associated shift for the Endo population. <keyFinding priority='2'>Endothelial cells do not contribute to the global transcriptional pathology signature of schizophrenia in this dataset.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell Subtype Characterization**  
The study did not report further subclustering or identification of distinct endothelial subtypes or states. The Endo population was treated as a single, homogeneous group, with no evidence for disease-associated sub-states or transitions. No spatial or morphological validation specific to endothelial cells was performed, and no mention was made of vascular pathology or blood-brain barrier gene signatures in the context of schizophrenia.

**Modulators, Metrics, and Cell-Cell Communication**  
No host or genetic factors (e.g., age, sex, medication, GWAS variants) were found to modulate endothelial cell abundance or transcriptional state. The study did not report ligand-receptor or cell-cell communication analyses involving endothelial cells, nor did it identify endothelial cells as a source or target of disease-relevant signaling.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories and Multi-omic Integration**  
Temporal modeling and enhancer-promoter mapping were focused on neuronal populations. There was no evidence for age- or disease-stage-dependent changes in endothelial cells, nor were any eQTLs or multi-omic links to schizophrenia risk variants reported for this cell type.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> for all major claims regarding endothelial and vascular cells, as the authors do not discuss any conflicting findings or prior reports of endothelial involvement in schizophrenia at the transcriptomic level.

</findings>

<clinical>
The study concludes that, in contrast to neurons, endothelial and vascular cells do not exhibit significant transcriptional dysregulation in schizophrenia. There is no evidence from this dataset that endothelial cells contribute to the molecular pathology or genetic risk of schizophrenia, nor are they implicated as a source of disease resilience or vulnerability. These findings suggest that, at least in the adult prefrontal cortex, endothelial cells are not a primary cellular substrate for schizophrenia pathogenesis or a promising target for transcriptome-based therapeutic intervention. <keyFinding priority='1'>Endothelial cells are not implicated in schizophrenia-associated molecular pathology in this single-nucleus RNA-seq study.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</clinical>

---

3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

The absence of significant transcriptional changes in endothelial and vascular cells in this large, well-powered single-nucleus RNA-seq study suggests that these cell types are not major contributors to schizophrenia pathology in the adult prefrontal cortex. This finding aligns with prior bulk and single-cell transcriptomic studies that have not highlighted vascular dysfunction as a core feature of schizophrenia, at least at the mRNA level. However, the study does not exclude the possibility of subtle, region-specific, or developmental-stage-dependent endothelial alterations, nor does it address non-transcriptional mechanisms (e.g., protein, epigenetic, or functional changes). Future research could explore vascular contributions in other brain regions, developmental windows, or in the context of comorbidities and environmental exposures. The lack of endothelial involvement in this dataset provides a useful negative control and underscores the specificity of neuronal and synaptic dysregulation in schizophrenia. No conflicts with prior models are discussed by the authors. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

# summary for Ruzicka 2024 (endothelial and vascular cells)

1) **Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

In this large-scale single-nucleus RNA-seq study of schizophrenia (Ruzicka et al., Science 2024), endothelial and vascular cells—including endothelial cells and pericytes—were robustly identified in human prefrontal cortex, but showed minimal schizophrenia-associated transcriptional changes compared to neuronal populations. No significant shifts in cell proportions or strong disease-associated subtypes were reported for these vascular cell types. The study’s main findings center on excitatory neurons, with endothelial and pericyte DEGs being sparse and not enriched for schizophrenia genetic risk or major pathways. Demographic and genetic modulators did not notably impact vascular cell states in this dataset.

</metadata>

<methods>
This study performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on postmortem prefrontal cortex (PFC) tissue from 140 individuals (75 schizophrenia, 65 controls) across two independent cohorts (McLean, Mount Sinai). Over 468,000 nuclei were profiled, with multiplexed hashing to minimize batch effects. Cell types were annotated using ACTIONet and marker gene expression, and differential expression (DE) was analyzed per cell type and cohort, followed by meta-analysis. Validation included in situ hybridization and qPCR for select neuronal genes, but not for vascular cells.
</methods>

<findings>
Endothelial and vascular cells (including pericytes) were robustly identified as distinct clusters in the integrated cell atlas of human PFC, using canonical markers (e.g., CLDN5, PECAM1/CD31 for endothelial cells; PDGFRB for pericytes). These cell types were well-represented across both cohorts, confirming the technical reliability of their detection.

**Cell Type Proportions:**  
The study explicitly states that no significant changes in the representation (proportion) of any major cell type—including endothelial cells and pericytes—were observed between schizophrenia and control groups. This was confirmed by quantitative analysis and visualized in supplementary figures (fig. S4B). The authors note that prior histological reports of cell loss in other cell types (e.g., inhibitory neurons) may reflect technical artifacts, but for vascular cells, no such loss or gain was detected.  
<keyFinding priority='2'>Endothelial and pericyte proportions are unchanged in schizophrenia PFC.</keyFinding>  
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>  
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression:**  
The meta-analysis identified 6634 significant DE events across all cell types, but the overwhelming majority (94%) were in neuronal populations, especially excitatory neurons. For endothelial cells and pericytes, the number of DEGs was very low, and none reached the prominence or reproducibility seen in neurons. The main text and summary figures (Fig. 2A, 2F) show that endothelial and pericyte DEGs were sparse, with no major up- or down-regulated gene sets highlighted.  
<keyFinding priority='2'>Endothelial and pericyte DEGs are minimal and not reproducibly associated with schizophrenia.</keyFinding>  
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>  
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Pathway Enrichment:**  
Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses were performed for all cell types, but endothelial and pericyte DEGs did not significantly enrich for any of the 14 major biological themes identified (e.g., neurodevelopment, synaptic signaling, cation transport). The only minor enrichment in vascular cells was for generic cellular processes, not disease-relevant pathways.  
<keyFinding priority='3'>No disease-relevant pathway enrichment in vascular cell DEGs.</keyFinding>  
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>  
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
The study did not report further subclustering or disease-associated subtypes within endothelial or pericyte populations. These cell types were treated as homogeneous groups, with no evidence for distinct schizophrenia-associated states or activation profiles.  
<keyFinding priority='2'>No disease-associated endothelial or pericyte subtypes identified.</keyFinding>  
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>  
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
No significant effects of age, sex, or genetic risk (polygenic risk scores, GWAS loci) were observed on endothelial or pericyte gene expression or proportions. The main genetic and demographic modulators in this study affected neuronal populations, not vascular cells.

**Gene Regulatory Networks & Cell-Cell Communication:**  
The study’s analysis of transcription factor modules and cell-cell communication focused on neuronal and glial populations. No endothelial- or pericyte-specific regulatory modules or ligand-receptor interactions were highlighted as altered in schizophrenia.

**Spatial Analysis & Morphology:**  
No spatial transcriptomics or morphological validation was performed for vascular cell subtypes. The main spatial findings pertained to neuronal layer specificity.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
No evidence was presented for age- or disease-stage–dependent changes in endothelial or pericyte states.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
Endothelial and pericyte DEGs did not overlap with schizophrenia GWAS or rare variant risk genes, nor did they show enrichment for eQTLs or other genetic drivers.

In summary, the study provides strong evidence that, in contrast to neurons, endothelial and vascular cells in the adult human PFC show minimal transcriptional or proportional changes in schizophrenia, with no evidence for disease-associated subtypes, pathway enrichment, or genetic risk convergence.  
<keyFinding priority='1'>The absence of significant schizophrenia-associated changes in endothelial and pericyte populations is a robust and reproducible finding in this large-scale single-nucleus study.</keyFinding>  
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>  
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
The data suggest that endothelial and vascular cells are not major contributors to the molecular pathology of schizophrenia in the adult PFC, at least at the transcriptomic level detectable by snRNA-seq. There is no evidence from this study that these cell types mediate genetic risk, serve as biomarkers, or represent therapeutic targets in schizophrenia. The findings reinforce a neuron-centric model of schizophrenia pathophysiology, with vascular cells remaining largely unaffected.
</clinical>

3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

The lack of significant schizophrenia-associated changes in endothelial and vascular cells in this comprehensive single-nucleus study raises important questions about the role of the neurovascular unit in psychiatric disorders. While prior hypotheses have suggested blood-brain barrier dysfunction or microvascular pathology in schizophrenia, this dataset provides no transcriptomic evidence for such mechanisms in the adult PFC. Future research may need to address whether vascular changes occur in other brain regions, at earlier disease stages, or are detectable only at the proteomic, epigenetic, or functional level. The absence of disease-associated subtypes or marker genes in vascular cells also suggests that single-nucleus RNA-seq may have limited sensitivity for subtle endothelial dysfunction, or that such dysfunction is not a core feature of schizophrenia. These findings align with previous large-scale snRNA-seq studies that have not highlighted vascular cells as major contributors to psychiatric disease, but leave open the possibility of region- or context-specific effects not captured here.

# summary for Schirmer 2019 (endothelial and vascular cells)

1) **Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

Single-nucleus RNA-seq of MS and control human brain tissue revealed that endothelial and vascular cells (including pericytes and endothelial cells) are present as distinct clusters, but show minimal disease-specific transcriptional changes or shifts in abundance in MS lesions. No major endothelial or vascular subtypes were identified as being selectively altered in MS, and there is no evidence for significant differential gene expression, pathway activation, or spatial redistribution of these cells in the context of MS pathology. The study’s main findings center on neurons and glia, with vascular cells largely unaffected by disease status, age, or lesion stage. <keyFinding priority='3'>Endothelial and vascular cells are not significantly altered in MS lesions in this dataset.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

<methods>
This study used single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to profile 48,919 nuclei from frozen postmortem human brain tissue, including cortical grey matter (GM), subcortical white matter (WM), and meningeal tissue from 12 MS and 9 control samples. The tissue blocks were selected to encompass lesion and non-lesion areas, and nuclei were isolated using sucrose-gradient ultracentrifugation. Cell type annotation was based on canonical marker genes, and spatial transcriptomic validation was performed using multiplex in situ hybridization (smFISH).
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Identification**  
Unbiased clustering of snRNA-seq data identified 22 major cell clusters, including neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), and smaller populations such as endothelial cells, pericytes, stromal cells, and leukocytes. Endothelial cells were annotated based on expression of canonical markers such as *CLDN5* (claudin-5), while pericytes were identified by *PDGFRB* expression (see Extended Data Fig. 1e).

**Endothelial and Vascular Cell Subtypes**  
The study does not report further subclustering or disease-associated subtypes within the endothelial or vascular cell populations. The endothelial cell cluster is present in both MS and control samples, with no evidence of selective expansion, depletion, or emergence of disease-specific subpopulations. Similarly, pericytes and stromal cells are detected as minor populations, but without significant disease-associated heterogeneity.

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**  
No significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) are reported for endothelial or vascular cells between MS and control samples. The main cell types showing robust transcriptional changes in MS are neurons (especially upper-layer excitatory neurons), oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and microglia. In contrast, endothelial and vascular cells do not exhibit notable upregulation or downregulation of genes, nor are they highlighted in pathway enrichment analyses for processes such as inflammation, stress response, or immune activation.

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**  
Spatial transcriptomic validation (smFISH) and immunohistochemistry in this study focus on neurons and glia, with no specific spatial analysis or morphological assessment of endothelial or vascular cells. There is no evidence presented for vascular remodeling, blood-brain barrier disruption, or perivascular changes in the context of MS lesions at the single-cell transcriptomic level.

**Modulators and Metrics**  
The study does not report any modulation of endothelial or vascular cell states by host factors such as age, sex, or genetic risk alleles (e.g., APOE). Quantitative metrics such as cell abundance or activation scores are not applied to these populations, reflecting their relative stability across disease and control conditions.

**Gene Regulatory Networks and Cell-Cell Communication**  
No endothelial- or vascular-specific transcription factors, regulatory modules, or ligand-receptor interactions are highlighted as altered in MS. The main cell-cell communication findings pertain to glial and immune cell cross-talk.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**  
Pseudotime and trajectory analyses are applied to neuronal and glial populations, but not to endothelial or vascular cells, due to the absence of dynamic changes or disease-associated transitions in these lineages.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**  
No integration of eQTL or GWAS data is performed for endothelial or vascular cell clusters, as these populations do not show disease-specific transcriptomic signatures in this dataset.

The absence of significant changes in endothelial and vascular cells in MS lesions, as revealed by snRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics, suggests that these cell types do not play a primary or direct role in the neuroinflammatory or neurodegenerative processes highlighted in this study. While vascular dysfunction and blood-brain barrier breakdown are recognized features of MS in other contexts, this dataset does not support a major contribution of endothelial or pericyte transcriptomic changes to MS lesion pathology.

3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study demonstrates that, within the sampled regions and using snRNA-seq, endothelial and vascular cells in the human brain are relatively stable and do not exhibit the disease-associated heterogeneity, activation, or loss observed in neurons and glia in MS. The lack of significant findings for these cell types suggests that, at least at the transcriptomic level and in the chronic lesions analyzed, vascular cells are not major contributors to MS lesion biology. This contrasts with some prior models that emphasize blood-brain barrier dysfunction in MS, but the authors do not explicitly discuss such contradictions, likely due to the focus on other lineages. Future studies may require higher-resolution vascular profiling, targeted sampling of perivascular niches, or integration with proteomic and functional assays to fully assess subtle or transient vascular changes. The current data reinforce the centrality of glial and neuronal pathology in MS, while highlighting the need for more sensitive or context-specific approaches to uncover potential vascular contributions. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) was performed on post-mortem human entorhinal and somatosensory cortex from 6 AD and 6 control brains (total 24 samples). Nuclei were enriched for glia by FACS depletion of NeuN+ (neuronal) and Sox10+ (oligodendroglial) nuclei. Data integration and clustering were performed using Seurat and LIGER. Immunohistochemistry and quantitative image analysis were used for validation. Endothelial and vascular cells were present but not the primary focus of enrichment.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Identification**  
Endothelial and vascular cells (including pericytes) were detected as distinct clusters in the UMAP embedding (see Fig. 1b, top left cluster labeled "Endothelia" and "Vascular Pericytes"). These clusters were clearly separated from astrocytes, microglia, neurons, and oligodendrocytes, confirming the presence of vascular cell types in the dataset. However, the overall proportion of endothelial and vascular cells was low compared to glia, as the enrichment protocol was designed to favor astrocytes and microglia.

**Subtype Identification and Marker Genes**  
The paper does not provide a detailed subclustering or transcriptional characterization of endothelial or vascular cell subtypes. In the UMAP (Fig. 1b), "Endothelia" and "Vascular Pericytes" are annotated as separate populations, but no further subdivision or disease-associated subtypes are described for these cell types. The heatmap (Fig. 1c) includes VWF (von Willebrand factor) as a marker for endothelial cells, and CLDN5 (claudin-5) as a marker for the blood-brain barrier, confirming the identity of these clusters.

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**  
The primary analyses of differential gene expression, pathway enrichment, and disease association focus on astrocytes and microglia. There is no report of significant changes in the proportion, gene expression, or pathway activity of endothelial or vascular cells in relation to AD pathology (amyloid-beta or pTau) in this study. The volcano plots and pathway enrichment analyses (Figs. 2–4) do not include endothelial or vascular cell data.

**Spatial/Morphological Validation**  
No immunohistochemical or spatial transcriptomic validation is reported for endothelial or vascular cell subtypes in this study.

**Modulators & Metrics**  
No quantitative changes, activation scores, or host/genetic modulators are reported for endothelial or vascular cells.

**Gene Regulatory Networks & Cell-Cell Communication**  
The cell-cell communication analysis (CellChat) is restricted to astrocytes and microglia. No ligand-receptor interactions or regulatory networks involving endothelial or vascular cells are described.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**  
No pseudotime or trajectory analysis is reported for endothelial or vascular cells.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**  
No eQTL or genetic risk variant analysis is reported for endothelial or vascular cells.

Summary:  
Endothelial and vascular cells (including pericytes) are present as distinct clusters in the dataset, confirmed by canonical marker genes (VWF, CLDN5). However, the study does not report any further subtyping, differential gene expression, or disease-associated changes for these cell types. The focus of all downstream analyses is on astrocytes and microglia, and there is no evidence from this paper for significant AD-related transcriptional changes in endothelial or vascular cells.

The study does not provide evidence for a disease-specific role, mechanistic insight, or biomarker/therapeutic implication for endothelial or vascular cells in Alzheimer’s disease. The lack of reported findings suggests that, within the limits of this glia-enriched dataset, endothelial and vascular cells do not show major transcriptional alterations associated with amyloid or tau pathology in the sampled regions.
</clinical>

**Quick Reference**
Endothelial and vascular cells (including pericytes) were detected as distinct clusters in this snRNA-seq study of AD and control human cortex, confirmed by canonical markers (VWF, CLDN5), but no disease-associated subtypes, differential gene expression, or pathway changes were reported for these cell types. All major findings and disease associations in this paper center on astrocytes and microglia, with no evidence for significant AD-related transcriptional changes in endothelial or vascular cells.

---

**Research Implications**
This study demonstrates that endothelial and vascular cells can be reliably identified in human snRNA-seq datasets using canonical markers, even when glial enrichment protocols are used. However, the lack of detailed analysis or significant findings for these cell types highlights a gap in current single-nucleus studies of AD, where vascular contributions to disease may be underexplored due to cell type enrichment strategies and low abundance. Future work should employ protocols specifically designed to capture and deeply profile endothelial and vascular cells, enabling the identification of potential disease-associated subtypes, transcriptional changes, and their roles in neurovascular dysfunction in AD. The absence of findings here does not contradict prior reports of vascular involvement in AD, but rather reflects the study’s design and analytical focus. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

# summary for Velmeshev 2019 (endothelial and vascular cells)

1) **Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

Velmeshev et al. (Science, 2019) performed single-nucleus RNA-seq on postmortem cortex from autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and control donors, identifying 17 major cell types including a distinct endothelial population marked by CLDN5. Endothelial cells showed a low burden of ASD-associated differentially expressed genes (DEGs), with no major subtype heterogeneity or disease-specific molecular states reported. The transcriptomic impact of ASD on endothelial cells was minor compared to neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, and endothelial DEGs did not significantly overlap with ASD genetic risk loci or clinical severity. <keyFinding priority='3'>Endothelial cells exhibit minimal transcriptomic dysregulation in ASD cortex.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>

Disease focus: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD)
</metadata>

<methods>
This study used single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) via the 10x Genomics platform to profile 104,559 nuclei from prefrontal cortex (PFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of 15 ASD and 16 control donors (ages 4–22). Cell type annotation was based on canonical marker genes, and clustering was performed jointly across all samples and regions. Validation included in situ RNA hybridization for key markers. Differential expression was assessed using a linear mixed model, and pathway enrichment was performed for DEGs. Bulk RNA-seq and deconvolution analyses were used for cross-validation.
</methods>

<findings>
The authors identified 17 major cell types, including excitatory and inhibitory neuronal subtypes, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), and a single endothelial cluster. Endothelial cells were annotated by expression of CLDN5, a canonical marker (see Fig. 1G).

**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Heterogeneity:**  
Endothelial cells were robustly detected as a single cluster, with no evidence for further subclustering or disease-associated endothelial subtypes. The study does not report any significant change in the proportion of endothelial cells between ASD and control samples. <keyFinding priority='3'>No evidence for endothelial cell subtype heterogeneity or proportional shifts in ASD cortex.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment:**  
The burden of ASD-associated DEGs in endothelial cells was low compared to other cell types. Figure 2I ("DEG burden per cell type") shows that endothelial cells are among the least affected, with only a handful of DEGs detected (exact number not specified, but visually estimated as <10). The volcano plot in Figure 2B (non-neuronal DEGs) confirms that endothelial cells (green dots) have few significant DEGs, and none are highlighted as top hits. No major up- or down-regulated genes are discussed for endothelial cells in the main text or figure legends.

Gene Ontology (GO) analysis (Fig. 2F, H) was performed for all DEGs and for those with high mRNA/nuclear RNA correlation, but no endothelial-specific pathways or processes are highlighted. The authors explicitly state that "no GO terms were identified for glial DEGs," and by extension, endothelial cells are not discussed as having enriched pathways. <keyFinding priority='3'>Endothelial cells show minimal transcriptomic response to ASD, with no significant pathway enrichment.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Association with Genetic Risk and Clinical Severity:**  
Overlap analysis (Fig. 2C–E) between cell type–specific DEGs and ASD genetic risk loci (SFARI genes, high-confidence risk genes) shows that endothelial cells do not significantly contribute to the enrichment of ASD risk genes. Figure 2E ("SFARI overlap by cell type") ranks endothelial cells near the bottom, indicating little overlap with known ASD risk loci.

Correlation of cell type–specific gene dysregulation with clinical severity (Fig. 4B) shows that endothelial cells are not among the cell types whose transcriptomic changes predict ASD clinical scores. The most predictive cell types are L2/3 excitatory neurons and microglia, with endothelial cells showing negligible association. <keyFinding priority='3'>Endothelial cell gene expression changes do not correlate with ASD genetic risk or clinical severity.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Spatial and Morphological Validation:**  
The study validated cell type annotation using in situ RNA hybridization for CLDN5 (Fig. 1G), confirming the presence and identity of endothelial cells in the cortex. However, no disease-associated spatial or morphological changes in endothelial cells are reported.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories and Modulators:**  
No evidence is presented for age, sex, or comorbidity (epilepsy) effects on endothelial cell states. The study does not report pseudotime or trajectory analyses for endothelial cells, nor does it identify any host or genetic factors modulating their transcriptomic profile in ASD.

**Gene Regulatory Networks and Cell-Cell Communication:**  
No endothelial-specific transcription factors, regulatory networks, or ligand-receptor interactions are discussed in the context of ASD.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>  
The authors do not discuss any contradictions or departures from prior models regarding endothelial cells. Their findings are consistent with the broader literature in that endothelial cells are not a major site of transcriptomic dysregulation in ASD cortex, at least at the level of nuclear RNA.

</findings>

<clinical>
The study concludes that endothelial cells in the ASD cortex exhibit minimal transcriptomic changes, with no evidence for disease-associated subtypes, altered proportions, or significant pathway dysregulation. There is no indication that endothelial cells contribute to the core molecular pathology of ASD, nor do their gene expression changes correlate with clinical severity or known genetic risk. These results suggest that, in contrast to neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, endothelial cells are not a primary driver or marker of ASD-related cortical dysfunction. <keyFinding priority='3'>Endothelial cells are unlikely to serve as therapeutic or biomarker targets in ASD based on current transcriptomic evidence.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
</clinical>

---

3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study provides strong evidence that cortical endothelial cells, as defined by CLDN5 expression, are largely spared from the transcriptomic dysregulation observed in ASD, at least at the nuclear RNA level and within the sampled age range. The lack of endothelial subtype heterogeneity or disease-associated molecular states contrasts with findings in neurons, astrocytes, and microglia, which show pronounced and functionally relevant changes. These results align with prior bulk and single-cell studies that have not implicated vascular cells as major contributors to ASD pathology. However, the study does not address potential post-transcriptional, epigenetic, or functional changes in endothelial cells, nor does it examine blood-brain barrier integrity or vascular interactions in detail. Future research could explore whether subtle endothelial dysfunctions exist at the protein or physiological level, or in other brain regions or developmental windows. Overall, the findings reinforce the neuron- and glia-centric model of ASD cortical pathology, with endothelial cells playing a minimal role according to current single-nucleus transcriptomic data. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Disease focus: Parkinson’s disease (PD)
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on postmortem human substantia nigra (SN) samples from 23 idiopathic PD patients and 9 controls (average age 81). The study used 10x Genomics Chromium, yielding 315,867 high-quality nuclei after quality control and doublet removal. Cell clusters were annotated using canonical markers and validated with immunohistochemistry (IHC), RNAscope in situ hybridization, and comparison to human midbrain organoids and mouse SN.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Identification**  
Endothelial cells (cluster c4) comprised 7% of all nuclei in the SN, making them a moderate but distinct population alongside pericytes (c8, 3.1%) and fibroblast-like cells (c10, 0.8%). The main endothelial marker was FLT1, with additional expression of COL1A2 and VCAN in pericytes and fibroblasts, respectively (Fig. 1C). The overall cell type proportions were not dramatically altered for endothelial cells in PD compared to controls, as shown in the cluster fraction barplot (Fig. 1E, D).

**Endothelial and Vascular Cell Subtypes**  
The study did not report further subclustering of the endothelial cell population (c4) or pericytes (c8), nor did it identify distinct subtypes or activation states within these vascular cell types. The annotation relied on canonical markers (FLT1 for endothelial cells, PDGFRB for pericytes), and no additional molecular heterogeneity or disease-associated subpopulations were described for these clusters.

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**  
Endothelial cells (c4) exhibited a moderate number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between PD and controls, ranking just after the most affected neuronal clusters (Fig. 5A). Upregulated pathways in c4 included ribosomal genes and protein translation, consistent with a general stress response observed across multiple cell types in PD (Fig. 5B). Metallothionein family genes (e.g., MT2A, MT1E, MT3) were also upregulated in c4, suggesting increased metal ion binding and detoxification activity (Fig. 5C). Downregulated pathways in c4 were not specifically highlighted, and synaptic or neurotransmission-related changes were not prominent in vascular clusters.

**PD-Associated Genes and GWAS Loci**  
Among genes mapped to PD GWAS loci, KTN1 was highly expressed in endothelial cells (c4) and upregulated in c9 neurons, but not specifically altered in c4 in PD (Fig. 6C-D). PRKN (PARK2) was enriched in c4 and pericytes (c8) and was downregulated in both cell types in PD (Fig. 6A, right). LRRK2, another PD risk gene, was also expressed in c4 but did not show significant differential expression in PD. The study found that, overall, PD GWAS genes were more frequently deregulated in neurons than in vascular cells.

**Cell-Cell Communication and Vascular Interactions**  
CellChat analysis revealed a global decrease in cell-cell communication for neuronal clusters in PD, but an increase in outgoing and incoming signaling for endothelial cells (c4), pericytes (c8), microglia, and fibroblasts (Fig. 7A-B). Specifically, several signaling pathways involving vascular cells were altered:
- The Angiopoietin-like protein (ANGPTL) pathway was activated in PD, with increased signaling involving endothelial and pericyte clusters.
- The Cadherin (CDH) pathway, important for cell adhesion and neurovascular integrity, was disrupted in pericytes (c8) and neuronal clusters, with a loss of CDH signaling in PD (Fig. 7C-D).
- Ephrin (EPHA/EPHB) signaling, which mediates axon guidance and vascular-neural interactions, was also lost in pericytes and endothelial cells in PD.

**Temporal and Genetic Modulation**  
No specific temporal trajectory or pseudotime analysis was reported for endothelial or vascular cells. The study did not identify genetic or demographic modulators (e.g., age, sex, APOE) specifically affecting endothelial or pericyte states.

**Spatial/Morphological Validation**  
No spatial transcriptomics or morphological validation (e.g., immunostaining for endothelial activation, vascular remodeling) was reported for endothelial or pericyte clusters. The main validation efforts focused on neuronal subtypes.

<keyFinding priority='1'>
The most significant vascular finding is the increased cell-cell communication strength for endothelial and pericyte clusters in PD, particularly involving the ANGPTL pathway, and the loss of CDH and EPHA/EPHB signaling, which may reflect altered neurovascular interactions in the PD substantia nigra.
</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
Endothelial and vascular cells in the human SN show moderate transcriptional changes in PD, with upregulation of stress-response and metal-binding genes, and altered intercellular signaling. The loss of cadherin and ephrin signaling pathways in vascular clusters may contribute to neurovascular dysfunction, potentially affecting blood-brain barrier integrity or local tissue homeostasis in PD. However, these findings are associative, and the study does not provide direct evidence for causal roles or specific vascular subtypes driving disease progression. No direct therapeutic or biomarker implications are proposed for endothelial or pericyte populations.

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**  
Endothelial cells (c4, FLT1+) and pericytes (c8, PDGFRB+) in the human substantia nigra show moderate transcriptional changes in Parkinson’s disease, including upregulation of metallothionein and ribosomal genes. While no distinct disease-associated subtypes were identified, cell-cell communication analysis revealed increased signaling strength for vascular clusters in PD, notably via the ANGPTL pathway, and a loss of cadherin and ephrin signaling. These changes suggest altered neurovascular interactions in PD, but no specific genetic or demographic drivers were identified for these cell types. <keyFinding priority='1'>ANGPTL pathway activation and CDH/EPH signaling loss in vascular cells are key PD-associated changes.</keyFinding>

---

**Research Implications (≈150 words):**  
This study provides a comprehensive single-nucleus transcriptomic atlas of the human SN in PD, but the analysis of endothelial and vascular cells remains at the level of broad cell types, without identification of finer subtypes or activation states. The observed upregulation of stress-response genes and altered intercellular signaling (ANGPTL, CDH, EPH) in vascular clusters aligns with emerging models of neurovascular dysfunction in neurodegeneration, but the lack of spatial or morphological validation limits mechanistic interpretation. The absence of distinct disease-associated endothelial or pericyte subpopulations contrasts with some prior reports in Alzheimer’s disease or animal models, though the authors do not explicitly discuss such discrepancies. Future studies should employ spatial transcriptomics or targeted vascular profiling to resolve endothelial heterogeneity and its role in PD pathology. The findings support the hypothesis that neurovascular signaling is perturbed in PD, but further work is needed to clarify causal relationships and therapeutic potential.

---

**Detailed Summary**

<findings>
The study systematically profiled endothelial and vascular cells from both the medial frontal cortex and the lateral choroid plexus, focusing on their transcriptional responses in severe COVID-19.

**Cell Type Proportions and Identification:**  
Endothelial cells were robustly identified in both brain regions using canonical markers (e.g., CLDN5, VWF). In the cortex, the 'endothelial' cluster also included vascular mural cell markers, but perivascular fibroblast-like cells and perivascular macrophages were not efficiently captured. In the choroid plexus, endothelial cells were a minor but distinct population among epithelial, mesenchymal, and immune cells (see Extended Data Fig. 3, 12).

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment:**  
<keyFinding priority='1'>Endothelial and vascular cells in both cortex and choroid plexus exhibited upregulation of antiviral defense genes, most notably IFITM3, in COVID-19 cases compared to controls. This upregulation was consistent across barrier cell types, including glia limitans and choroid plexus endothelium, and was validated by RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry.</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
The upregulation of IFITM3, a key interferon-induced transmembrane protein, is interpreted as a marker of antiviral response rather than direct viral infection, as no SARS-CoV-2 RNA or protein was detected in these cells by multiple orthogonal assays.

Other upregulated genes in endothelial and barrier cells included STAT3 (inflammatory signaling), C1S and C3 (complement pathway), and NQO1 (oxidative stress response). These changes were corroborated by RT-qPCR and immunostaining (Fig. 2a–b, Extended Data Fig. 8).

**Cell Subtype Characterization:**  
The study did not report further subclustering of endothelial cells into distinct subtypes beyond the main endothelial population in either cortex or choroid plexus. However, the choroid plexus endothelium was analyzed alongside epithelial and mesenchymal barrier cells, all of which showed a coordinated upregulation of antiviral and inflammatory genes in COVID-19.

**Functional Signature and Disease Association:**  
<keyFinding priority='2'>Endothelial and barrier cells in the choroid plexus showed the most pronounced transcriptional response, with broad upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes and complement components, suggesting a role in sensing and relaying peripheral inflammation into the CNS.</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
No evidence was found for direct viral neuroinvasion or productive infection of endothelial cells; instead, the observed changes are interpreted as a response to systemic inflammation.

**Spatial and Morphological Validation:**  
Immunohistochemistry confirmed increased expression of inflammatory markers (e.g., CD68+ macrophage activation) in the choroid plexus and perivascular regions (Extended Data Fig. 8, 11). However, no specific SARS-CoV-2 protein was detected in endothelial cells, and vascular reactivity seen with one antibody was not replicated with others, suggesting non-specific binding.

**Cell-Cell Communication and Barrier Function:**  
<keyFinding priority='1'>Computational analysis (CellChat) predicted increased inflammatory signaling from choroid plexus epithelial and endothelial cells to brain parenchymal cells, especially via CCL/CXCL chemokines and complement pathways. This suggests that choroid plexus barrier cells act as intermediaries, relaying peripheral immune signals into the brain parenchyma.</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
This relay is proposed to activate microglia and astrocytes, contributing to neuroinflammation.

**Host/Genetic Modulators:**  
The study cohort was aged 55–91, but no specific genetic or demographic modifiers of endothelial responses were identified within this dataset.

**Temporal/Disease Trajectory:**  
All findings are cross-sectional; no direct evidence for temporal progression or transitions between endothelial cell states is provided.

**Genetic/Multi-omic Integration:**  
No direct integration with GWAS or eQTL data for endothelial subtypes is reported, though overall COVID-19 DEGs overlapped with risk loci for neuropsychiatric traits in other cell types.
</findings>

<clinical>
Endothelial and vascular cells in the brain and choroid plexus do not show evidence of direct SARS-CoV-2 infection but mount a robust antiviral and inflammatory response in severe COVID-19. The choroid plexus endothelium, in particular, appears to sense peripheral inflammation and relay it into the CNS, potentially contributing to neuroinflammation and neurological symptoms. These findings suggest that endothelial dysfunction in COVID-19 is mediated by systemic immune activation rather than direct viral effects, and may play a role in the pathogenesis of COVID-19-associated neurological complications. Therapeutic targeting of endothelial inflammation or barrier signaling may be relevant, but causal links remain to be established.
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications**

This study provides a high-confidence, cell-type-resolved map of endothelial and vascular cell responses in the human brain and choroid plexus during severe COVID-19. The absence of direct viral infection in these cells, despite robust upregulation of antiviral and inflammatory genes, supports a model in which systemic inflammation, rather than neuroinvasion, drives CNS endothelial dysfunction. The coordinated response of choroid plexus barrier cells, including endothelium, highlights their potential role as immune sensors and mediators of brain-peripheral cross-talk. Open questions remain regarding the heterogeneity of endothelial responses (no subtypes beyond the main population were defined here), the reversibility of these changes, and their contribution to long-term neurological sequelae. The findings are consistent with, but extend, prior models of neuroimmune relay at the brain barriers, and do not contradict existing data on COVID-19 neuroinvasion. Future work should address endothelial cell heterogeneity at higher resolution, integrate genetic risk, and explore therapeutic modulation of barrier inflammation.

The study provides a comprehensive atlas of human brain vascular and perivascular cells, capturing >30,000 endothelial cell (BEC) nuclei, >27,000 pericytes, >7,000 SMCs, and >3,000 perivascular fibroblasts. Endothelial and mural cells were further subdivided into transcriptionally distinct subtypes along the arteriovenous axis.

**Endothelial Cell (BEC) Subtypes and Zonation**
Endothelial cells were classified into arterial, capillary, venous, and a rare “tip-like” cluster:
- **Arterial BECs**: Defined by high expression of VEGFC and ALPL. Enriched for actin binding and phospholipase C activity. 
- **Capillary BECs**: Marked by MFSD2A and SLC7A5. Enriched for phospholipid transport and carboxylic acid transport.
- **Venous BECs**: Characterized by IL1R1 and NR2F2. Enriched for cytokine receptor and growth factor receptor activity.
- **Tip-like BECs**: Express PLAUR, LAMB1, and heat shock proteins, suggesting a role in angiogenesis or stress response.
<keyFinding priority='1'>The study recapitulates a gradual, continuous arteriovenous zonation in human BECs, validated by pseudotime analysis and immunostaining, but finds that many canonical mouse zonation markers (e.g., VWF) are not conserved in humans.</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>
The authors explicitly note that only a minority of top mouse zonation markers retain predictive value in humans, highlighting species-specific differences.

**Endothelial Cell Disease Associations**
- **Cell Loss in AD**: There is a significant reduction in BEC nuclei in AD compared to NCI, confirmed by decreased Hoechst+ nuclei within collagen IV+ vessels, despite unchanged vessel area.
- **Gene Expression in AD**: BECs in AD show downregulation of genes involved in protein transport and upregulation of inflammatory pathways, especially interferon signaling in APOE4 carriers.
- **Pathway Enrichment**: AD DEGs in BECs implicate dysregulated vasoconstriction, compromised blood flow, and impaired protein transcytosis (e.g., clathrin-mediated endocytosis).

**Endothelial Cell Subtype Markers and Functional Roles**
- **Arterial BECs**: VEGFC↑, ALPL↑, PLCG2↑ (also an AD GWAS gene).
- **Capillary BECs**: MFSD2A↑, SLC7A5↑, SLC39A10↑ (upregulated in APOE4 carriers).
- **Venous BECs**: IL1R1↑, NR2F2↑, VWF↑ (but not venous-specific in humans).
- **Tip-like BECs**: PLAUR↑, LAMB1↑, HSPH1↑.

**Modulators & Metrics**
- **APOE4 genotype**: Associated with increased interferon signaling in BECs.
- **Brain region**: Hippocampal BECs show higher baseline inflammation than cortical BECs, potentially contributing to regional vulnerability.

**Gene Regulatory Networks and Cell-Cell Communication**
- BECs express multiple AD GWAS genes involved in protein transport (PICALM, CD2AP), immune signaling (HLA-DRB1, PLCG2), and ECM pathways (ADAMTS1, FERMT2).
- Many of these genes are microglia-specific in mice but are robustly expressed in human BECs, suggesting evolutionary divergence.

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**
- Immunohistochemistry confirms the vascular localization of key marker proteins (e.g., SLC39A10, VWF, ALPL, PLCG2).
- Loss of vascular nuclei in AD is validated by histology.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**
- No emergence of new BEC subclusters in AD, but selective loss of BECs and region-specific transcriptional differences are diminished in AD.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**
- At least 30 of the top 45 AD GWAS genes are enriched in human vascular and perivascular cells, with BECs containing the most AD-related GWAS hits.
- Human BECs show higher expression of these risk genes than mouse BECs, especially for genes involved in endocytosis and immune signaling.

<keyFinding priority='1'>The study reveals that human BECs are a major site of AD genetic risk gene expression, with many risk genes (e.g., PICALM, CD2AP, HLA-DRB1) showing human-specific vascular enrichment.</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>
The authors explicitly discuss that these genes are microglia-specific in mice but vascular in humans.

**Other Vascular Cell Types**
- **Pericytes**: Two main subtypes—T-pericytes (solute transporters: SLC6A1, SLC1A3, SLC12A7) and M-pericytes (ECM organization: COL4A1-4, LAMA4, ADAMTS1). M-pericytes are selectively vulnerable in AD.
- **SMCs**: Arterial (aSMC), arteriolar (aaSMC), and venous SMCs, with abrupt transcriptomic transitions from SMCs to pericytes.
- **Fibroblasts**: Perivascular fibroblasts (ECM, ABC efflux pumps) and meningeal fibroblasts (solute influx SLC transporters), with spatially polarized transporter expression.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
The study demonstrates that human brain endothelial cells are highly heterogeneous and are selectively vulnerable in Alzheimer’s disease, with loss of BECs and altered gene expression linked to impaired blood flow and protein clearance. Many AD risk genes are robustly expressed in BECs, suggesting that vascular dysfunction may be a primary mediator of genetic risk. The findings imply that targeting endothelial pathways (e.g., protein transport, immune signaling) could be therapeutically relevant, and that human-specific vascular biology must be considered in translational research.

**Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This study provides a single-nucleus transcriptomic atlas of human brain vascular cells, revealing that endothelial cells (BECs) are highly heterogeneous along the arteriovenous axis and are selectively lost in Alzheimer’s disease. Key BEC subtypes are defined by VEGFC (arterial), MFSD2A (capillary), and IL1R1 (venous), with many AD risk genes (e.g., PICALM, CD2AP, HLA-DRB1) showing strong, human-specific expression in BECs. APOE4 genotype is associated with increased endothelial inflammation. These findings highlight the central role of endothelial and vascular cells in mediating AD genetic risk and pathology.

**Research Implications (≈150 words)**

This work establishes a foundational atlas for human brain vascular cell diversity, highlighting substantial species differences in endothelial gene expression and AD risk gene localization. The finding that many AD GWAS genes are robustly expressed in human BECs—but not in mouse BECs—calls into question the direct translatability of mouse vascular models for AD and suggests that human-specific mechanisms underlie vascular contributions to disease. Open questions include the causal role of endothelial dysfunction in AD progression, the mechanistic impact of specific risk genes in BECs, and the interplay between vascular and microglial pathways. The lack of new BEC subclusters in AD, but selective loss and transcriptional changes, suggests that therapeutic strategies should focus on preserving endothelial integrity and function. The atlas also provides a resource for identifying vascular targets for drug delivery and biomarker development. The authors explicitly discuss the need to distinguish between transcriptional responses and drivers of disease in future studies.

<metadata>
Zhang et al., 2024, Journal of Neuroinflammation. Disease focus: Perihematomal edema (PHE) after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH).
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) was performed on perihematomal brain tissue from 9 ICH patients, sampled at three timepoints (0–6h, 6–24h, 24–48h post-ICH). Cell type identification was based on canonical marker genes. Immunofluorescence was used for validation of microglia-monocyte interactions, but not for endothelial cells.
</methods>

<findings>
Endothelial and vascular cells were identified as a distinct cluster (cluster 18) in the scRNA-seq dataset, defined by high expression of canonical endothelial markers CLDN5, VWF, RGS5, and EGFL7 (see Figure 1E). These markers are consistent with established vascular identity in the human brain. The UMAP and clustering analyses confirmed the presence of endothelial cells across all patient samples and timepoints.

**Cell Type Proportions:**  
The proportion of endothelial cells remained relatively constant across the three PHE progression groups (G1: 0–6h, G2: 6–24h, G3: 24–48h), as shown in Figure 1D. There was no statistically significant increase or decrease in endothelial cell abundance during the acute to early subacute phases of PHE. This suggests that, unlike microglia and neutrophils (which expanded or shifted in state), endothelial cells did not undergo major population changes in the sampled perihematomal tissue during the first 48 hours post-ICH.

<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression and Subtype Analysis:**  
The study did not report any further subclustering or identification of distinct endothelial subtypes or activation states. No endothelial-specific disease-associated, inflammatory, or stress-response subpopulations were described. The dot plot (Figure 1E) confirmed robust expression of endothelial markers, but there was no mention of up- or down-regulation of these or other genes in response to ICH or PHE progression.  
<keyFinding priority='2'>No evidence for endothelial cell heterogeneity, activation, or disease-associated subtypes was found in this dataset.</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Pathway Enrichment and Functional Signatures:**  
Unlike microglia and neutrophils, for which extensive pathway and pseudotime analyses were performed, endothelial cells were not subjected to pathway enrichment or trajectory modeling. There is no mention of altered angiogenic, barrier, or inflammatory signaling in the endothelial compartment.  
<keyFinding priority='3'>No pathway enrichment or functional reprogramming was reported for endothelial cells in PHE tissue post-ICH.</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Spatial/Morphological Validation:**  
No immunofluorescence or in situ validation was performed for endothelial cells. The study’s spatial and morphological analyses focused on microglia and their interactions with monocytes, not on vascular elements.

**Cell-Cell Communication:**  
The cell-cell communication analysis (CellChat) did not highlight any major ligand-receptor interactions involving endothelial cells. The most prominent signaling axes involved microglia, monocytes, and neutrophils, particularly via the SPP1 (osteopontin) pathway. Endothelial cells were not implicated as major senders or receivers in these networks.

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
No evidence was presented for modulation of endothelial cell states by clinical variables (age, sex, hypertension), genetic factors, or pathology load. No endothelial-specific activation or injury scores were calculated.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
No pseudotime or trajectory analysis was performed for endothelial cells, and there was no evidence for dynamic transitions or state changes in this compartment during the acute PHE phase.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
No eQTL, GWAS, or multi-omic integration was performed for endothelial cells in this study.

<keyFinding priority='2'>Overall, the study found that endothelial and vascular cells in perihematomal tissue after ICH are transcriptionally stable, lack disease-associated subtypes, and do not show evidence of activation or injury responses during the first 48 hours post-ICH.</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
The findings suggest that, in the context of acute PHE after ICH, endothelial and vascular cells do not undergo major transcriptional or population changes, nor do they adopt disease-associated or inflammatory phenotypes. This contrasts with the marked activation and heterogeneity observed in microglia and neutrophils. The lack of endothelial activation or injury signatures implies that, at least within the first 48 hours post-ICH, the vascular compartment may not be a primary driver of the immune microenvironment or secondary injury in PHE. No therapeutic or biomarker implications for endothelial cells are proposed in this study.
</clinical>

---

3) **Research Implications**

The absence of endothelial cell heterogeneity, activation, or disease-associated subtypes in this acute PHE scRNA-seq dataset raises several questions. First, it is unclear whether endothelial activation or injury responses might emerge at later stages of PHE or in other brain regions, as this study was limited to the first 48 hours post-ICH and to perihematomal tissue. Second, the lack of observed changes may reflect technical limitations (e.g., cell loss during dissociation, low endothelial cell yield) or the possibility that endothelial responses are primarily post-transcriptional or spatially restricted. Third, the findings do not contradict prior models of blood-brain barrier dysfunction in ICH, but suggest that such dysfunction may not be accompanied by overt transcriptional reprogramming of endothelial cells in the acute phase, or may be mediated by other mechanisms (e.g., paracrine signaling from activated microglia or neutrophils). The study does not reference or discuss conflicts with prior endothelial-focused research, and thus <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> applies.

Future studies should employ spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, or functional assays to determine whether subtle or localized endothelial changes contribute to PHE pathophysiology, and whether endothelial responses become more prominent at later stages or in response to therapeutic interventions. Integration with vascular imaging or BBB permeability assays may also clarify the role of endothelial cells in PHE evolution.

# summary for Zhou 2020 (endothelial and vascular cells)

1) **Quick Reference (Endothelial and Vascular Cells in Zhou et al., Nat Med 2020)**

This study used snRNA-seq to profile brain cell types in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) in both mouse models and human post-mortem tissue, including the impact of TREM2 variants. Endothelial and vascular cells were robustly identified as distinct clusters in both species, but showed minimal transcriptional or proportional changes in response to AD pathology or TREM2 genotype. No disease-associated endothelial subtypes or strong marker gene shifts were reported, and endothelial cells contributed few differentially expressed genes or pathways to the AD signature, with no evidence for TREM2-dependent modulation.

**Differential Gene Expression:**  
No major differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were reported for endothelial cells in either mouse or human AD brains. The volcano plots and heatmaps of DEGs (e.g., Extended Data Figs. 5, 8a, 10c) focus on microglia, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and neurons, with endothelial cells contributing few, if any, significant DEGs.

**Gene Regulatory Networks, Cell-Cell Communication, Spatial Analysis:**  
No endothelial-specific transcription factors, ligand-receptor interactions, or spatial/morphological changes were described. The study did not report in situ or immunostaining validation for endothelial cell changes.

The authors do not discuss any conflicts or discrepancies regarding endothelial or vascular cell findings compared to prior literature.

</findings>

<clinical>
The study concludes that endothelial and vascular cells do not exhibit significant transcriptional or proportional changes in AD or in response to TREM2 genotype, in contrast to the pronounced glial and neuronal alterations. There is no evidence from this dataset that endothelial cells play a direct or disease-modifying role in AD pathogenesis, nor are they implicated as biomarkers or therapeutic targets based on these results. <keyFinding priority='3'>Endothelial cells appear transcriptionally stable and are not major contributors to the AD cellular response in this study.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</clinical>

3) **Research Implications**

The lack of significant findings for endothelial and vascular cells in this comprehensive snRNA-seq study suggests that, at least at the transcriptomic level and in the sampled brain regions, these cells are not major drivers or responders in AD pathology or TREM2-mediated risk. This contrasts with the robust glial and neuronal changes observed. Open questions remain regarding potential subtle or region-specific endothelial dysfunction, post-transcriptional changes, or blood-brain barrier alterations that might not be captured by snRNA-seq. The absence of disease-associated endothelial subtypes or marker gene shifts in this study aligns with some prior single-cell datasets, but does not rule out functional or vascular contributions to AD pathogenesis detectable by other modalities (e.g., imaging, proteomics, functional assays). Future studies could address whether endothelial changes emerge in other brain regions, at different disease stages, or in response to vascular comorbidities. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

This study provides a comprehensive single-nucleus transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of the prefrontal cortex in Parkinson’s disease, with a focus on endothelial and vascular cells. Endothelial cells (Endo, marked by CLDN5, EBF1, ADGRF5, TFPI) showed no significant change in proportion between PD and controls and exhibited relatively few differentially expressed genes (DEGs) compared to glial populations. Pathway analysis revealed modest alterations, including upregulation of blood coagulation and vascular development pathways, but no major disease-associated endothelial subtypes were identified. No strong genetic or demographic drivers of endothelial changes were reported. <keyFinding priority='3'>Endothelial cell alterations in PD prefrontal cortex are subtle and not a primary driver of pathology in this cohort.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>

Detailed Summary (≈800-1000 words)
---

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Identification**  
Endothelial cells were identified as one of eight major brain cell types using canonical markers (CLDN5, EBF1, ADGRF5, TFPI). The relative proportion of endothelial cells did not significantly differ between PD and control brains, as shown in Figure 1E and Table S2. The clustering and annotation were robust, with cell type explaining the majority of transcriptomic variance (>56%).

**Endothelial Cell Subtypes and Marker Genes**  
The study did not report further subclustering or identification of distinct endothelial subtypes or states within the prefrontal cortex. Endothelial cells were treated as a single population, defined by the above markers. No disease-associated or homeostatic subpopulations were described for this cell type.

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**  
Endothelial cells exhibited a relatively small number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between PD and controls (36 upregulated, 22 downregulated; see Figure 1F). The magnitude and direction of these changes were modest compared to glial populations (astrocytes, microglia), which showed the most prominent transcriptional alterations in PD.

Gene Ontology (GO) pathway analysis for endothelial cells revealed upregulation of pathways related to blood coagulation, regulation of blood coagulation, and vasculature development in PD. Downregulated pathways included phospholipid binding and virus receptor activity, but these were not highlighted as major findings by the authors. <keyFinding priority='2'>Endothelial cells in PD show modest upregulation of coagulation and vascular development pathways, but without clear evidence for a disease-specific endothelial activation state.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**  
No specific spatial or morphological validation (e.g., immunostaining for endothelial markers, vessel density quantification) was reported for endothelial cells in this study. The focus of in situ validation was on neuronal and microglial markers.

**Modulators and Metrics**  
Variance partition analysis indicated that cell type, not disease status, age, sex, or postmortem interval, was the primary driver of transcriptomic variation. No significant associations were reported between endothelial cell gene expression and genetic risk factors (e.g., PD GWAS loci), clinical variables, or pathology load.

**Gene Regulatory Networks and Cell-Cell Communication**  
Weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) of the proteomic data identified one protein module (M7) enriched for both astrocyte and endothelial markers (including COL1A2, CAVIN2, FN1 for endothelium). However, this module was not specifically highlighted as altered in PD, nor was it linked to a distinct endothelial phenotype. <keyFinding priority='3'>Proteomic modules containing endothelial markers did not show strong disease-specific changes.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>

CellPhoneDB analysis of cell-cell communication revealed a general decrease in interaction pairs across all cell types in PD, with the most marked loss between excitatory neurons and astrocytes. Endothelial cell interactions were not specifically discussed as altered or prioritized in the context of PD pathology.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories and Genetic Integration**  
No pseudotime or trajectory analysis was performed for endothelial cells, and no integration with eQTL or genetic risk data was reported for this cell type.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
The study concludes that endothelial and vascular cells in the prefrontal cortex of PD brains do not exhibit major disease-associated transcriptional or proteomic changes. While there is modest upregulation of coagulation and vascular development pathways, these alterations are minor compared to the pronounced neuroinflammatory and gliosis signatures in microglia and astrocytes. The data do not support a primary role for endothelial dysfunction in PD pathogenesis within this brain region, nor do they suggest endothelial cells as a major source of biomarkers or therapeutic targets in late-stage PD. <keyFinding priority='3'>Endothelial cell changes in PD are subtle and likely secondary to broader neuroinflammatory processes.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>
</clinical>

Research Implications (≈100–200 words)
---
This study provides a high-confidence, negative result regarding the involvement of endothelial and vascular cells in the prefrontal cortex of late-stage Parkinson’s disease. The lack of distinct disease-associated endothelial subtypes, minimal differential gene expression, and absence of strong pathway enrichment or genetic associations suggest that, at least in this brain region and disease stage, endothelial dysfunction is not a primary driver of PD pathology. This contrasts with some prior reports in other neurodegenerative or vascular dementias, where endothelial activation and blood-brain barrier disruption are more prominent. The findings highlight the importance of region- and disease-stage specificity in interpreting vascular contributions to neurodegeneration. Future studies could address whether endothelial changes are more pronounced in other brain regions (e.g., substantia nigra, midbrain) or at earlier disease stages, and whether subtle vascular alterations might contribute to PD progression in a context-dependent manner. The results also underscore the need for multi-omic and spatially resolved approaches to fully capture potential endothelial heterogeneity in neurodegenerative disease. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

- Donghua Zou et al., 2024, Pharmacological Research 201 (2024) 107098.
- Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
</metadata>

<methods>
This study integrated single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) from 85 AD and 83 control human samples (covering prefrontal cortex, olfactory cortex, parietal and frontal regions, hippocampus, and peripheral blood) with spatial transcriptomics from coronal brain sections of 6 AppNL-G-F AD mice and 6 controls at multiple ages. Cell types were annotated using canonical markers, and spatial mapping validated cell distributions. Differential gene expression and pathway enrichment analyses were performed, with some findings validated by immunostaining and immunoprecipitation in mouse models.
</methods>

<findings>
The authors identified 19 major cell types in the human brain, including endothelial cells (En) and pericytes (Per), using established marker genes (Fig. 1B, 1C). Endothelial cells were annotated based on canonical markers (not explicitly listed in the main text, but consistent with recent scRNA-seq studies). The study’s primary focus was on neuron-microglia interactions, but it does provide several relevant findings for vascular cells:

**Cell Type Proportions:**  
The UMAP and vesicle map (Fig. 1B, 1C) show clear clustering of endothelial cells and pericytes. However, the authors do not report significant changes in the overall abundance of endothelial or pericyte populations between AD and control brains. The main text does not highlight vascular cell proportion shifts as a major feature of AD in this dataset.

**Differential Gene Expression:**  
The volcano plots (Fig. 1D) indicate that endothelial cells in AD brains exhibit significant dysregulation of mitochondrial genes, including MT-CO1, MT-CO2, MT-CO3, MT-ND1, MT-ND2, MT-ND4, and MT-CYB. These changes are consistent with the broader theme of mitochondrial dysfunction across multiple cell types in AD. The directionality (up/down) for these genes in endothelial cells is not specified in the main text, but the overall pattern is described as “significant dysregulation.”

**Pathway Enrichment:**  
While the study does not provide a detailed breakdown of pathway enrichment specifically for endothelial cells, it references prior work (Lau et al., 2020) showing that AD dysregulates gene expression in vascular endothelial cells. In this study, the spatial transcriptomics analysis further confirms altered mitochondrial gene expression in vascular regions (Fig. 1E, 1F), suggesting that energy metabolism and mitochondrial pathways are affected in the vascular compartment.

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
No novel subtypes or disease-associated states of endothelial or vascular cells are described. The authors do not report the identification of distinct endothelial subpopulations (e.g., tip, stalk, venous, arterial, or blood-brain barrier-specific states) or pericyte subtypes. There is no mention of homeostatic versus disease-associated endothelial states, nor are any unique marker genes or functional signatures highlighted for vascular cells in AD.

**Spatial Analysis:**  
Spatial transcriptomics (Fig. 1E, 1F) validates the presence and distribution of endothelial cells in both control and AD mouse brains. The spatial mapping confirms that mitochondrial gene dysregulation is not limited to neurons but also affects vascular regions, supporting the notion of widespread metabolic disturbance in AD.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
The study does not model endothelial or vascular cell trajectories across disease stages or aging. Pseudotime and developmental analyses are presented for neuronal and microglial populations, but not for vascular cells.

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
No specific genetic, demographic, or pathological modulators (e.g., APOE genotype, sex, amyloid/tau load) are reported to influence endothelial or pericyte states in this study.

**Gene Regulatory Networks & Cell-Cell Communication:**  
The main cell-cell communication analyses focus on microglia-neuron interactions (PTPRG-CNTN4 axis). There is no discussion of ligand-receptor interactions involving endothelial or vascular cells, nor are transcriptional regulators of vascular states explored.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
No eQTL, GWAS, or multi-omic integration is performed for endothelial or vascular cell subtypes.

<keyFinding priority='2'>The most salient vascular finding is the confirmation, via both scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics, that endothelial cells in AD brains display significant dysregulation of mitochondrial genes, paralleling changes seen in neurons and glia. This supports the concept of vascular metabolic dysfunction as a component of AD pathology, but the study does not identify novel endothelial subtypes or provide mechanistic insights specific to vascular cells.</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
The study reinforces the idea that vascular metabolic dysfunction, particularly involving mitochondrial pathways, is a feature of AD brain pathology. However, it does not provide evidence for disease-specific endothelial subtypes, nor does it link vascular transcriptomic changes to clinical variables, genetic risk, or therapeutic targets. The findings are associative and do not establish causality between endothelial dysfunction and AD progression. No biomarker or therapeutic implications specific to vascular cells are proposed.
</clinical>

---

3) **Research Implications**

This study confirms, using high-resolution single-cell and spatial transcriptomics, that endothelial cells in AD brains exhibit significant mitochondrial gene dysregulation, consistent with prior reports of vascular dysfunction in neurodegeneration. However, the lack of novel endothelial subtypes or disease-specific vascular states suggests that, in this dataset, vascular transcriptomic changes are broad and not restricted to unique cell states. Open questions remain regarding the functional consequences of these metabolic alterations in endothelial cells—such as their impact on blood-brain barrier integrity, neurovascular coupling, or immune cell trafficking in AD. The absence of detailed subtype analysis or cell-cell communication involving vascular cells limits mechanistic insight. Future studies should apply targeted subclustering, spatial mapping, and functional validation to dissect endothelial heterogeneity and its role in AD pathogenesis. The findings here align with, but do not extend, existing models of vascular involvement in AD, and no explicit contradictions with prior data are discussed by the authors.
