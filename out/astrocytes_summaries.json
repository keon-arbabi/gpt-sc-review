Astro.4, marked by upregulation of OSMR, VIM, and CTSB, resembles disease-associated astrocytes (DAA) and is prominent in APP/PSEN1 mutation carriers. Astro.1, an activated astrocyte state, is increased in MS4A rs1582763-A carriers, who also show depletion of resting astrocytes (Astro.0). These findings highlight genetic modulation of astrocyte heterogeneity in AD, with ADAD and MS4A variants as key drivers.\n\n---\n\n2) **Detailed Summary (≈800–1000 words)**\n\n<metadata>\nLogan Brase, Shih-Feng You, Ricardo D’Oliveira Albanus, et al.

Deep subclustering and differential expression analyses were conducted for each major cell type, with validation in ROSMAP (DLPFC) and 5xFAD mouse models.\n</methods>\n\n<findings>\nAstrocytes were robustly profiled, yielding five transcriptional subclusters (Astro.0–Astro.4), each with distinct marker gene signatures and disease/genotype associations.\n\n**Cell Type Proportions:**  \nAstrocytes comprised a substantial fraction of total nuclei. Notably, the proportion of specific astrocyte subtypes varied with genetic background and disease status.\n\n**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  \n- **Astro.0:** Identified as the resting or homeostatic astrocyte population, marked by high expression of LUZP2, SLC7A10, and MFGE8 (see Extended Fig. 1a). This subtype was depleted in MS4A rs1582763-A carriers (<keyFinding priority='2'>Astro.0 is reduced in MS4A resilience variant carriers, suggesting a shift away from homeostatic states.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n- **Astro.1:** Represents an activated astrocyte state, characterized by upregulation of GFAP, ID3, AQP4, ID1, and FABP7. There was a trend toward increased Astro.1 in MS4A rs1582763-A carriers (<keyFinding priority='2'>Astro.1 is increased in MS4A resilience variant carriers, indicating a genetic influence on astrocyte activation.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>). The MS4A genes themselves are not expressed in astrocytes, suggesting this effect may be mediated by microglia-astrocyte cross-talk.\n- **Astro.4:** This subtype is specifically enriched in ADAD (APP/PSEN1 mutation) carriers (β=0.15, P=0.044), with increased expression of OSMR (log2FC=1.48), VIM (log2FC=1.80), and CTSB (log2FC=1.56) compared to other astrocyte states. These markers overlap with those of disease-associated astrocytes (DAA) described in the 5xFAD mouse model (<keyFinding priority='1'>Astro.4 is a DAA-like astrocyte state, uniquely enriched in ADAD, and marked by OSMR, VIM, CTSB upregulation.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>). This suggests a conserved, genetically-driven astrocyte response to amyloid pathology.\n- **Astro.2 and Astro.3:** These subtypes are less well characterized in the text, but Extended Fig. 1a shows their marker gene profiles. They do not show strong disease or genetic associations in the main findings.\n\n**Differential Gene Expression & Pathway Enrichment:**  \n- Astro.4 upregulates genes associated with reactivity and stress response (OSMR, VIM, CTSB), consistent with a DAA phenotype.  \n- Astro.1 upregulates canonical activation markers (GFAP, AQP4, FABP7), suggesting a transition from homeostatic to reactive states.\n- Pathway analysis for these subtypes is not detailed for astrocytes specifically, but the marker genes indicate involvement in cytoskeletal remodeling, inflammation, and possibly cytokine signaling.\n\n**Modulators & Metrics:**  \n- **Genetic Drivers:**  \n  - ADAD (APP/PSEN1 mutations) is a strong driver of Astro.4 enrichment.\n  - MS4A rs1582763-A (resilience variant) is associated with increased Astro.1 and decreased Astro.0, despite MS4A genes not being expressed in astrocytes, implying indirect modulation.\n- **Host Factors:**  \n  - No explicit age, sex, or APOE genotype effects on astrocyte subtypes are reported in detail for astrocytes.\n\n**Spatial/Morphological Validation:**  \n- The DAA-like signature of Astro.4 is validated by overlap with mouse 5xFAD DAA markers (Extended Fig. 1a), supporting cross-species conservation (<keyFinding priority='2'>Astro.4’s DAA-like signature is conserved in mouse models of amyloid pathology.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n\n**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  \n- The enrichment of Astro.4 in ADAD and its DAA-like profile suggest that this state may represent a late-stage or genetically accelerated astrocyte response to amyloid pathology.  \n- The shift from Astro.0 (resting) to Astro.1 (activated) in MS4A resilience variant carriers may reflect a genetically modulated trajectory toward a more reactive, possibly protective, astrocyte state.\n\n**Gene Regulatory Networks & Cell-Cell Communication:**  \n- While not detailed for astrocytes, the authors note that MS4A effects on astrocytes may be mediated by microglia-astrocyte cross-talk, as MS4A genes are not astrocyte-expressed.\n\n**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  \n- The study links GWAS loci to cell types, but for astrocytes, the main focus is on the indirect effect of MS4A variants and the direct effect of APP/PSEN1 mutations.\n\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>  \nThe authors do not report explicit contradictions regarding astrocyte subtypes compared to prior literature, but note that the DAA-like state in human ADAD brains aligns with findings from mouse models.\n\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nAstrocyte heterogeneity in AD is strongly modulated by genetic background. The DAA-like Astro.4 state, enriched in ADAD, may contribute to or reflect heightened astrocyte reactivity in response to amyloid pathology, potentially influencing neuroinflammation and disease progression. The shift toward activated astrocytes (Astro.1) and away from resting states (Astro.0) in MS4A resilience variant carriers suggests that genetic resilience may operate via modulation of glial activation states, possibly through microglia-astrocyte signaling. These findings imply that astrocyte subtypes could serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets, but causal roles remain to be established.\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**\n\nThis study demonstrates that astrocyte heterogeneity in the human cortex is shaped by both pathogenic and resilience-associated AD genetic variants. The identification of a DAA-like astrocyte state (Astro.4) in ADAD, with conserved marker expression across species, supports the translational relevance of mouse models for human astrocyte pathology. The modulation of astrocyte activation states by the MS4A resilience variant, despite the absence of MS4A expression in astrocytes, highlights the importance of intercellular signaling—likely microglia-astrocyte cross-talk—in shaping glial responses to AD risk. Open questions include the functional consequences of these astrocyte states for neuronal health and disease progression, the mechanisms by which microglial genetic variants influence astrocyte phenotypes, and whether these subtypes are present in other brain regions or in earlier disease stages. The findings align with, and extend, known DAA classification schemes, but also suggest that genetic context can drive unique or exaggerated astrocyte responses. Future work should address the causal impact of these subtypes and their potential as therapeutic targets or biomarkers in genetically stratified AD populations.\n\n---\n\n**End of structured summary.**"

Data were clustered and classified using unsupervised and supervised approaches, with astrocyte sub-clustering performed using SC3 consensus clustering. Validation included immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and qPCR.\n</methods>\n\n---\n\n**Quick Reference**\n\nThis study used snRNA-seq to profile astrocytes in the cingulate cortex of Huntington disease (HD) patients, revealing three major reactive astrocyte states distinguished by GFAP, metallothionein (MT) gene, and protoplasmic marker expression. Disease-associated astrocyte states were strongly linked to upregulation of MT genes and GFAP, with a marked loss of homeostatic markers (e.g., SLC1A2), and were validated by immunostaining. The most reactive subtypes were enriched in layers with pronounced pathology and showed evidence of cell-autonomous changes, including mutant HTT aggregation.\n\n---\n\n**Detailed Summary**\n\n<findings>\nThe authors performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing on the cingulate cortex from HD and control brains, focusing on astrocyte heterogeneity and disease-associated states. Astrocytes were identified and sub-clustered into six transcriptionally distinct clusters, with three clusters predominantly from HD tissue and three from controls. \n\n**Cell Type Proportions:**  \nAstrocytes comprised 21% of HD and 24% of control nuclei, with a shift in subpopulation structure in HD.

Pathway analysis revealed enrichment for metal ion binding, heat shock response, and immune/inflammatory pathways in HD astrocytes, while neurotransmitter transport and cholesterol synthesis were reduced (<keyFinding priority='1'>HD astrocytes upregulate MT and stress response genes, and downregulate homeostatic and lipid metabolism genes</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n\n**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  \nThree major HD-associated astrocyte states were defined by supervised classification using GFAP, MT2A, and SLC1A2 expression:\n- **State 1-Q (\"quiescent with early reactive features\")**: High MT2A, low GFAP, high SLC1A2. Predominantly HD cluster 1. These astrocytes express high levels of MT genes and some homeostatic markers, suggesting an early or protective response (<keyFinding priority='1'>State 1-Q astrocytes are abundant in HD and marked by high MT gene expression</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n- **State 2-R (\"reactive with high MTs\")**: High MT2A, high GFAP, low SLC1A2. Mainly HD clusters 1 and 2. These astrocytes show both high GFAP and MT expression, with loss of homeostatic genes.\n- **State 3-R (\"reactive with low MTs\")**: Low MT2A, high GFAP, low SLC1A2. Mainly HD clusters 2 and 5. These astrocytes have high GFAP but low MTs, and have lost most homeostatic markers, possibly representing a late or end-stage reactive phenotype.\n\nIn contrast, control astrocytes were mostly in the \"quiescent\" state (low MT2A, low GFAP, high SLC1A2), with some heterogeneity in GFAP and stress gene expression.\n\n**Morphological/Spatial Validation:**  \nImmunofluorescence confirmed increased numbers and intensity of GFAP+ and MT+ astrocytes in HD, with some astrocytes showing both markers and others only one. Mutant HTT aggregates were observed in a subset of HD astrocytes, especially in layers V/VI, supporting a cell-autonomous component to reactivity (<keyFinding priority='2'>Mutant HTT aggregates are present in reactive astrocytes, suggesting cell-autonomous pathology</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n\n**Gene Regulatory Networks:**  \nGene co-expression network analysis (MEGENA) identified modules enriched in HD astrocyte clusters for MTs, lipid metabolism, and stress response, while control modules were enriched for neurotransmitter transport and synaptic function. Differential gene correlation analysis revealed that MT genes were more tightly co-regulated in HD, and negatively correlated with GFAP, indicating distinct regulatory programs in reactive states.\n\n**Cell-Cell Communication & Spatial Analysis:**  \nNo direct ligand-receptor analysis was reported, but the spatial distribution of reactive astrocytes corresponded to regions of greatest neuronal loss.\n\n**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  \nThe authors propose, based on cross-sectional data, that the three reactive states may represent a temporal progression, with loss of homeostatic markers and increasing GFAP/MT expression as disease advances. However, this remains speculative (<keyFinding priority='2'>Astrocyte states may reflect a trajectory from early MT-high to late GFAP-high, homeostatic marker-low phenotypes</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n\n**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  \nNo direct eQTL or GWAS integration was performed, but the presence of mutant HTT in astrocytes and the cell-autonomous changes suggest a genetic driver.\n\n**Contradictions/Departures:**  \nThe authors explicitly note that the classic A1/A2 astrocyte classification (as defined by C3 and other markers) does not fit the HD cingulate cortex, as C3 was not upregulated in HD astrocytes, and only a minority of Barres A1/A2 genes were differentially expressed. This is a departure from prior models in other neurodegenerative diseases (<contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>: The authors state that \"applying the A1 versus A2 classification is not appropriate in the HD cingulate cortex,\" as C3 and most A1/A2 markers were not upregulated in HD astrocytes).\n\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nAstrocytes in HD cingulate cortex exhibit marked heterogeneity, with three major reactive states defined by GFAP and MT expression and loss of homeostatic genes. These states are strongly associated with disease, and their abundance correlates with regions of neuronal loss and mutant HTT aggregation. The upregulation of MT genes may represent a neuroprotective or \"astro-protective\" response, while the loss of glutamate transporters and lipid metabolism genes suggests impaired support for neurons. The findings imply that astrocyte dysfunction in HD is both a response to and a driver of neurodegeneration, and that targeting specific astrocyte states or their regulatory networks could have therapeutic potential. However, causal relationships remain to be established, and the temporal sequence of state transitions is inferred but not directly demonstrated.\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications**\n\nThis study provides a detailed atlas of astrocyte heterogeneity in HD cortex, identifying three major reactive states that do not conform to the classic A1/A2 paradigm. The upregulation of metallothionein genes and loss of homeostatic markers are consistent with findings in other neurodegenerative diseases, but the lack of C3/A1 signature is a notable departure. Open questions include whether the identified states represent a temporal progression, how they relate to neuronal vulnerability, and whether MT-high states are neuroprotective or maladaptive. Future work should integrate spatial transcriptomics, longitudinal sampling, and functional studies to clarify the causal role of astrocyte states in HD progression. The marker genes and modules identified here provide a foundation for such studies and may inform biomarker or therapeutic development targeting astrocyte reactivity in HD.\n\n<contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>: The authors explicitly state that the A1/A2 astrocyte classification does not apply to HD cingulate cortex, as C3 and most A1/A2 markers are not upregulated, contrasting with prior models in other diseases.\n\n---\n\n**End of Summary**"

As a result, no significant findings regarding astrocyte subtypes, marker genes, or disease associations in schizophrenia were reported. The main conclusions pertain to neuronal cell types, especially upper-layer principal neurons and GABAergic interneurons, with astrocytes only minimally represented in the data. <keyFinding priority='3'>Astrocytes were not systematically analyzed for subtype heterogeneity or disease-associated changes in this study.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n---\n\n**Detailed Summary**\n\n<findings>\nAstrocytes were not a primary focus of this study. The experimental design specifically targeted neuronal nuclei by using NeuN+ fluorescence-activated nucleus sorting (FANS), which resulted in a dataset composed of approximately 94% neuronal nuclei and only 6% glial nuclei (see Fig. 1C). The authors explicitly state that \"glial nuclei were excluded from the subsequent analyses\" because the study was designed to investigate neuronal diversity and schizophrenia-associated changes in neurons.\n\nIn the initial clustering and annotation (Fig. 1B–E), a small cluster labeled \"Glia\" is visible, but this population was not further subdivided or analyzed for astrocyte-specific markers, subtypes, or disease associations. The heatmap (Fig. 1D) and marker gene analysis focus on neuronal markers (e.g., GAD1, SATB2, CUX2, RORB, FEZF2, THEMIS, VIP, ID2, SST, PVALB, SLC1A3, MBP), with SLC1A3 (an astrocyte marker) included only as a reference to distinguish glial from neuronal clusters. No further breakdown of astrocyte subtypes or states is provided.\n\nThe compositional and transcriptomic analyses (Fig. 2, Table 1) do not report any findings for astrocytes. All major results, including cell type proportion changes, differential gene expression, pathway enrichment, and spatial validation, are restricted to neuronal subtypes. The authors note that \"because our study was focused on neurons, glial nuclei were excluded from the subsequent analyses.\"\n\nSpatial transcriptomics (Visium) included all cell types present in the DLPFC, and the authors mention that \"possible perturbations of glia\" were noted in the spatial analysis (Supplementary Dataset Table 4), but no specific findings or discussion regarding astrocyte subtypes, marker genes, or disease associations are presented in the main text or figures. The spatial mapping (Fig. 7E) shows that non-neuronal cell types were predicted using external reference datasets, but these results are not elaborated for astrocytes.\n\nNo astrocyte subtypes, marker genes, or functional states are defined or discussed in relation to schizophrenia in this paper. There is no mention of changes in astrocyte abundance, gene expression, pathway activity, or spatial distribution in the main results or supplementary materials.\n\n<keyFinding priority='3'>Astrocytes were not systematically analyzed for subtype heterogeneity, marker gene expression, or disease-associated changes in this study.

The disease relevance of astrocytes remains unaddressed in this dataset.\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications**\n\nThis study does not provide new insights into astrocyte heterogeneity, disease-associated states, or functional roles in schizophrenia. The intentional exclusion of glial nuclei from downstream analyses means that open questions regarding astrocyte involvement in schizophrenia—such as their contribution to synaptic regulation, neuroinflammation, or metabolic support—remain unanswered by this work. The lack of astrocyte findings is consistent with the study's neuron-centric design and does not contradict prior literature, but it highlights the need for future single-cell or single-nucleus studies specifically targeting astrocytes and other glial populations in schizophrenia. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nIf future studies wish to address astrocyte diversity and disease associations in schizophrenia, they will need to employ protocols that enrich for or specifically analyze glial nuclei, use astrocyte-specific markers, and apply appropriate clustering and validation strategies.

The proportion of astrocytes did not significantly change across young, aged, and PD groups, and no major expansion or depletion of astrocyte subpopulations was observed in PD (<keyFinding priority='2'>astrocyte abundance is stable across conditions</keyFinding>).\n\n**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**\nReclustering and trajectory analysis of astrocytes revealed several subpopulations, but these did not correspond to a unique disease-associated astrocyte (DAA) subtype as described in Alzheimer’s disease or mouse models. Instead, astrocyte heterogeneity was characterized by a continuum along a pseudopathogenesis trajectory (cPP), which increased significantly from young to aged samples but showed no further increase in PD (<keyFinding priority='1'>astrocyte cPP is age-driven, not PD-driven</keyFinding>). <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nThree main astrocyte states were defined based on gene expression modules:\n- **Homeostatic/GFAP-low astrocytes:** Expressed LUZP2, SLC7A10, MFGE8; these signatures decreased with age and cPP.\n- **Reactive astrocytes:** Upregulated GFAP, VIM, CHI3L1, S100B, MT1A; these signatures increased with age and peaked at intermediate cPP.\n- **Disease-associated astrocyte (DAA)-like:** Expressed CSTB, VIM, OSMR, GSN, GGTA1P; these signatures also increased with age but did not show a PD-specific enrichment.\n\n**Differential Gene Expression & Pathways:**\nGenes upregulated along the astrocyte cPP included those involved in apoptosis resistance (e.g., BCL2), chaperone-mediated autophagy (LAMP2, HSPA1A, HSPB1, BAG3), and stress response (MT2A, HSP90AA1). Downregulated genes were related to neuronal support and synaptic function (NRXN1, SHANK2, GRM5, ATXN1, SLC1A2, PARK2). <keyFinding priority='2'>This suggests a shift from neuronal support to stress adaptation with age</keyFinding>. <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>\n\n**Chromatin Accessibility & Regulatory Features:**\nDespite clear transcriptional changes, chromatin accessibility at astrocyte promoters and enhancers changed little with age or PD.

No strong evidence was found for astrocyte-specific regulatory effects of PD risk variants.\n\n**Spatial/Morphological Validation:**\nNo spatial or morphological validation specific to astrocyte subtypes was reported. RNA-FISH validation focused on oligodendrocyte markers.\n\n**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**\nPseudopathogenesis trajectory analysis showed that astrocyte transcriptional changes are progressive with age but plateau in PD, indicating that astrocyte state transitions are primarily an aging phenomenon in the midbrain. <keyFinding priority='1'>Astrocyte aging signatures dominate over PD-specific changes</keyFinding>. <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>\n\n**Contradictions/Departures:**\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> The authors note that, unlike microglia and oligodendrocytes, astrocytes do not show a PD-specific disease-associated state in the midbrain, which contrasts with findings in Alzheimer’s disease and some mouse models.\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nAstrocytes in the human midbrain undergo significant transcriptional remodeling with age, characterized by increased stress response and chaperone-mediated autophagy pathways and decreased neuronal support functions. However, these changes are not further accentuated in Parkinson’s disease, and no distinct disease-associated astrocyte subtype emerges in PD. Thus, astrocytes may contribute to age-related vulnerability but are unlikely to be primary drivers of PD pathogenesis in the midbrain.

The upregulation of stress response and chaperone-mediated autophagy genes with age aligns with known astrocyte reactivity signatures but diverges from the DAA profiles seen in Alzheimer’s disease or mouse models. The lack of major chromatin accessibility changes suggests that transcriptional remodeling may be regulated by distal elements or post-transcriptional mechanisms. Open questions include whether astrocyte aging signatures contribute to neuronal vulnerability in PD and if similar patterns are observed in other brain regions or at earlier disease stages.

This finding was consistent with prior bulk and single-cell studies. <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Differential Gene Expression:**  \nAstrocytes exhibited the highest number of DEGs among all cell types (see Figure 3A), including both protein-coding and non-coding transcripts. The top DEG in astrocytes was the lncRNA AC008957.2 (antisense to SLC1A3). SLC1A3, encoding a glutamate transporter (GLAST), was also upregulated (FDR = 0.07), contrasting with prior mouse studies where SLC1A3 was downregulated in alcohol-exposed astrocytes. <keyFinding priority='1'>Upregulation of SLC1A3 and its antisense lncRNA AC008957.2 in astrocytes of alcohol-dependent individuals</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag> (The authors note this is opposite to findings in mouse models.)\n\nOther notable DEGs in astrocytes included FAS, MFGE8, and IRF3, all associated with neuroinflammatory and apoptotic pathways.

These changes may contribute to altered neuroimmune signaling and excitatory neurotransmission in alcohol dependence, potentially mediating neurotoxicity or maladaptive plasticity. The enrichment of GWAS risk loci among astrocyte DEGs suggests that astrocytic dysfunction may be a genetically driven component of alcohol dependence pathophysiology. While these findings highlight astrocytes as a key cell type in alcohol-related brain changes, the cross-sectional and associative nature of the data precludes strong causal inference. <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications**\n\nThis study establishes astrocytes as the most transcriptionally responsive cell type to chronic alcohol exposure in the human PFC, with a strong enrichment for both protein-coding and non-coding DEGs. The upregulation of SLC1A3 and its antisense lncRNA, along with neuroimmune and apoptotic pathway genes, suggests a shift in astrocyte function that may underlie aspects of alcohol-induced neuropathology. The significant overlap between astrocyte DEGs and alcohol dependence GWAS loci provides a genetic rationale for targeting astrocytic pathways in future research and therapeutic development.\n\nHowever, the lack of astrocyte subclustering or identification of disease-associated astrocyte states limits insight into potential heterogeneity within this cell type. The authors explicitly chose not to pursue subtypes, focusing instead on established cell classes. This leaves open the question of whether specific astrocyte subpopulations or activation states (e.g., A1/A2, reactive, neurotoxic) are differentially affected in alcohol dependence, as has been shown in other neurological disorders. The observed upregulation of SLC1A3 in human alcoholic astrocytes, in contrast to downregulation in mouse models, highlights possible species differences or context-dependent regulation, as discussed by the authors.\n\nFuture studies with larger sample sizes, higher-resolution subclustering, and integration of spatial or morphological data will be necessary to resolve astrocyte heterogeneity and clarify the functional consequences of these transcriptomic changes. Direct experimental validation and longitudinal studies will be required to establish causality and therapeutic relevance.\n\n<contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>  \nThe authors explicitly note that SLC1A3 is upregulated in human alcoholic astrocytes but downregulated in mouse models, suggesting a species-specific or context-dependent response. This is discussed as a departure from prior animal studies.\n\n---\n\n**End of Summary**"

These astrocytic responses are distinct from other glial cells and are not strongly modulated by demographic variables, but closely track Braak stage progression. <keyFinding priority='1'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>\n\n---\n\n**Detailed Summary (≈800–1000 words)**\n\n<metadata>\nDavila-Velderrain J, Mathys H, Mohammadi S, et al.

Cell types and subtypes were identified via graph-based clustering, with annotation supported by reference datasets (human/mouse spatial, single-cell, and microdissected RNA-seq).

The absence of discrete astrocyte subtypes in this dataset suggests that these responses may reflect dynamic state transitions within a broadly homogeneous population, rather than stable subpopulations. The findings align with, but also extend, prior models of disease-associated astrocytes by emphasizing early metabolic changes and their temporal separation from later inflammatory responses. Open questions include whether finer astrocyte subtypes might be resolved with deeper sequencing or spatial methods, how these transcriptional states relate to functional or morphological changes in situ, and whether similar patterns are observed in other brain regions or in relation to specific genetic risk factors. The study’s integration with spatial and cross-species data strengthens confidence in the findings, but future work should address potential regional heterogeneity and causal relationships between astrocytic changes and neuronal vulnerability. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

The astrocyte cluster (cluster 9) was defined by high expression of these markers, consistent with established literature.\n\nA striking feature was the uneven distribution of astrocyte nuclei across samples: 90% of astrocyte nuclei originated from the PSEN1 mutation carrier (Sample3), with minimal representation from the two sporadic AD cases (Sample1 and Sample2). This resulted in a low entropy value (0.89) for the astrocyte cluster, indicating significant sample bias. The authors explored whether this was due to technical artifacts (e.g., nuclei extraction, sequencing, or QC filtering) or biological differences, but could not definitively resolve the cause. Attempts to recover more astrocyte nuclei from the underrepresented samples by relaxing QC thresholds (e.g., allowing nuclei with fewer detected genes, as glial cells often express fewer genes than neurons) did not increase astrocyte yield, suggesting a possible technical limitation or true biological difference in astrocyte abundance or nuclear RNA content.\n\nNo evidence was found for further astrocyte subtypes or disease-associated astrocyte states within the dataset. The clustering approach did not reveal distinct homeostatic versus reactive astrocyte populations, nor were there transcriptomic signatures corresponding to known reactive or neurotoxic astrocyte states (e.g., A1/A2) described in other studies. The astrocyte cluster was defined by canonical markers, but no up- or down-regulation of specific genes or pathways was reported as associated with disease status, genotype (PSEN1, APOE), or pathology load.\n\nThe study did not report significant differential gene expression or pathway enrichment in astrocytes between Mendelian and sporadic AD, nor between samples with different APOE genotypes.

The findings do not contradict established astrocyte classification schemes, but highlight the need for improved protocols to reliably capture and analyze astrocytes from frozen human brain tissue. Future studies should include larger cohorts, neuropathology-free controls, and orthogonal validation (e.g., immunostaining, spatial transcriptomics) to clarify astrocyte roles in AD.

Single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) was performed using 10x Genomics, with nuclear hashing for multiplexing. Cell type annotation was based on canonical marker genes, and batch effects were corrected using Harmony. Differential gene expression and compositional analyses were performed using linear mixed models. Validation included immunohistochemistry and viral RNA/protein detection, confirming absence of SARS-CoV-2 in brain tissue.\n</methods>\n\n<findings>\nAstrocyte Characterization and Subtypes:\nAstrocytes were robustly identified in all three brain regions, forming two transcriptionally distinct subclusters, labeled Ast1 and Ast2. Both subtypes were defined by high expression of AQP4, a canonical astrocyte marker, and further supported by gene set enrichment analysis and comparison to published human brain snRNA-seq datasets. <keyFinding priority='2'>Astrocyte subtypes (Ast1, Ast2) are transcriptionally stable and consistent with known homeostatic astrocyte populations.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nCell Type Proportions:\nQuantitative analysis of cell type proportions across COVID-19 and control samples revealed no significant changes in the abundance of either astrocyte subtype (Ast1 or Ast2) in any brain region (PFC, medulla, ChP).

The majority of COVID-19-associated transcriptional changes were concentrated in microglia and monocyte/macrophage populations, with astrocytes showing a transcriptional profile consistent with homeostasis. <keyFinding priority='1'>No disease-associated astrocyte activation or stress-response signature was detected in severe COVID-19.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nPathway Enrichment and Functional Implications:\nGene set enrichment and pathway analyses for astrocytes did not reveal significant upregulation or downregulation of pathways related to inflammation, stress response, or neuroprotection in COVID-19 cases. Astrocyte marker gene expression (AQP4, SLC1A2, GFAP) remained stable, and no evidence was found for a shift toward reactive or disease-associated astrocyte states. <keyFinding priority='2'>Astrocyte functional pathways remain unaltered in acute severe COVID-19.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nSpatial and Morphological Data:\nNo spatial transcriptomics or immunohistochemical validation specific to astrocyte subtypes or activation states was reported. The study’s immunohistochemistry focused on immune cell markers (e.g., CD68 for monocytes/macrophages).\n\nModulators & Metrics:\nNo significant modulation of astrocyte states or proportions was observed in relation to age, sex, or clinical variables within the cohort. The study did not report any association between astrocyte subtypes and genetic risk factors or COVID-19 GWAS loci.\n\nGene Regulatory Networks & Cell-Cell Communication:\nGene regulatory network (GRN) analysis identified cell type-specific transcription factors, but astrocyte-specific regulons (e.g., PAX6) did not show altered activity in COVID-19. No evidence was presented for altered astrocyte-mediated cell-cell communication or ligand-receptor interactions in disease.\n\nAging/Disease Trajectories:\nPseudo-temporal trajectory and dynamic modeling were applied to microglia but not to astrocytes, due to the lack of significant transcriptional changes in the latter.\n\nGenetic or Multi-omic Integration:\nNo eQTL or multi-omic integration findings were reported for astrocytes in this study.\n\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> The authors do not discuss any explicit contradictions regarding astrocyte findings compared to prior literature, but note that their main findings diverge from studies reporting astrocyte activation in other neuroinflammatory or viral contexts.\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nDisease Relevance:\nAstrocytes, despite their established roles in neuroinflammation and blood-brain barrier maintenance, did not exhibit disease-associated transcriptional or compositional changes in severe COVID-19 in this cohort. The absence of astrocyte activation or stress-response signatures suggests that, in the acute phase of severe COVID-19 (and in the absence of detectable CNS viral invasion), astrocytes remain in a homeostatic state. <keyFinding priority='1'>Astrocytes do not appear to drive or mediate the neuroinflammatory response in acute severe COVID-19, in contrast to microglia and infiltrating immune cells.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nTherapeutic/Biomarker Implications:\nNo astrocyte-derived biomarkers or therapeutic targets are suggested by these data for acute COVID-19-related neuroinflammation.\n</clinical>\n\nResearch Implications (≈100–200 words)\n---\nThe findings from Fullard et al. (2021) indicate that astrocytes remain largely homeostatic in severe, acute COVID-19, with no evidence for disease-associated subtypes, activation, or stress-response states. This contrasts with some prior reports of astrocyte reactivity in other neuroinflammatory or viral encephalitic conditions, and with studies in COVID-19 that have suggested astrocyte involvement based on bulk or spatial transcriptomics. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> The authors do not explicitly discuss conflicts, but the lack of astrocyte response may reflect the absence of direct viral neuroinvasion in their cohort, or differences in disease stage, region, or technical sensitivity.\n\nOpen questions include whether astrocyte activation might occur at different disease stages, in milder or chronic COVID-19, or in regions not sampled here. Future studies with larger cohorts, additional brain regions, or spatially resolved methods may clarify the context-dependence of astrocyte responses. The stability of astrocyte states in this setting suggests that therapeutic strategies targeting astrocytes may not be warranted for acute COVID-19 neuroinflammation, but further research is needed to assess their role in long-term or post-acute sequelae."

The study emphasizes that a substantial fraction of eGenes (genes with significant cis-eQTLs) are only detectable at the astrocyte subtype level: 1,284 eGenes were unique to astrocyte subtypes, compared to 2,066 at the cell type level. <keyFinding priority='1'>This demonstrates that genetic regulation of gene expression in astrocytes is highly context- and subtype-specific, with many regulatory effects masked in bulk or cell-type-level analyses.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nAstrocyte subtypes (Ast.1–Ast.6) are not described in detail in the main text, but the clustering approach and marker gene selection are referenced in the methods and supplementary materials. The study does not report major shifts in the overall proportion of astrocytes or their subtypes associated with AD or genetic risk variants: <keyFinding priority='2'>No significant fraction QTLs (fQTLs) were detected for astrocyte subtypes, indicating that common genetic variation does not strongly influence the abundance of astrocyte subpopulations in this cohort.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nDifferential gene expression and pathway enrichment for astrocyte subtypes are not the primary focus, but the study notes that many eGenes are shared across cell types, while others are astrocyte-specific despite being expressed in multiple cell types—suggesting enhancer-driven, context-dependent regulation. <keyFinding priority='2'>Astrocyte eQTLs are enriched in astrocyte-specific enhancers and promoters, as shown by chromatin state analysis.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nIntegration with iPSC-derived astrocyte RNA-seq (n=38 lines) shows that 121 of 2,529 astrocyte eGenes (4.8%) are replicated in vitro, with effect sizes and directions largely concordant between in vivo and iPSC contexts. However, the MAPT locus (encoding tau) shows an opposite direction of effect in iPSC-derived astrocytes compared to brain astrocytes, highlighting context-specificity. <keyFinding priority='2'>Most astrocyte eQTLs are consistent between brain and iPSC-derived astrocytes, but notable exceptions (e.g., MAPT) exist.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag> (The authors explicitly discuss this inversion and its implications.)\n\nColocalization with AD GWAS loci identifies several risk haplotypes where the likely causal gene is regulated in astrocytes or their subtypes.

The lack of fQTLs for astrocyte subtypes indicates that genetic risk is more likely to act through gene expression modulation than through altering astrocyte population structure. The replication of eQTLs in iPSC-derived astrocytes supports the use of these models for functional follow-up, but context-specific effects (e.g., MAPT) caution against overgeneralization. Potential therapeutic or biomarker implications include targeting subtype-specific regulatory pathways in astrocytes at AD risk loci.\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications**\n\nThis study establishes that astrocyte gene regulation in the aging human cortex is highly subtype-specific, with many eQTLs undetectable in bulk or cell-type-level analyses. The identification of AD GWAS loci (e.g., APH1B, CCDC6) with astrocyte-specific regulatory effects highlights astrocyte subtypes as potential mediators of genetic risk. The lack of genetic effects on astrocyte subtype proportions suggests that disease risk is conferred through regulatory, not compositional, changes. The partial replication of eQTLs in iPSC-derived astrocytes supports their use for mechanistic studies, but the MAPT locus inversion underscores the need for careful context matching. Open questions include the functional roles of specific astrocyte subtypes in AD pathogenesis, the identity of their defining marker genes (not detailed in the main text), and whether further subtype resolution or spatial profiling will reveal additional disease-relevant heterogeneity. The findings align with, and extend, prior models by demonstrating the necessity of high-resolution, subtype-level analysis for understanding astrocyte contributions to neurodegenerative disease.\n\n<contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag> applies to the MAPT eQTL directionality, as discussed by the authors.

The most prominent disease-associated change was a significant early and sustained increase in a specific protoplasmic astrocyte supertype (Astro_2) as AD pathology progressed, as measured by the CPS. This increase was robust across both MTG and A9 regions, though not always replicated in external datasets due to differences in subtype granularity and sampling (<keyFinding priority='1'>Early and robust increase in protoplasmic astrocyte supertype (Astro_2) with AD progression</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n\nOther astrocyte subtypes (fibrous, interlaminar, and the novel supertype) did not show significant proportional changes with disease. The increase in protoplasmic astrocytes was not confounded by sex, age, or APOE4 status, as these were included as covariates in the compositional models.\n\n**Defining Marker Genes and Functional Signatures**  \nThe disease-associated protoplasmic astrocyte supertype (Astro_2) was defined by upregulation of canonical astrocyte markers (GFAP, SLC1A2, SLC1A3), as well as a suite of genes involved in cell adhesion (CADM1, CDRH3, PCDHGA1, PCDHB14/16, CLSTN1, ITGA6, NEO1, ANOS1), neuronal guidance (NLGN3, NTRK3, SEMA4B, NTNG2), and signaling (PTCHD1, NRP1, BMPR2, UNC5C). GFAP upregulation was a hallmark of astrogliosis and was observed early in the CPS trajectory (<keyFinding priority='2'>Early upregulation of GFAP and adhesion/guidance molecules in protoplasmic astrocytes</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n\nIn later disease stages, further upregulation was seen in additional adhesion and signaling molecules (NCAM2, CERCAM, PTCHD4, PTCH2, SMO, GLI1, EGF, EGFR), indicating a progressive shift in astrocyte functional state. Notably, APOE expression in astrocytes decreased with disease progression, while it increased in microglia, suggesting a cell-type-specific redistribution of this key AD risk gene (<keyFinding priority='2'>Late-stage decrease in astrocytic APOE expression</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n\n**Pathway Enrichment and Functional Implications**  \nGene set enrichment analyses indicated that early astrocyte changes involved pathways related to cell adhesion, axonal guidance, and extracellular signaling, consistent with a reactive, potentially neuroprotective or remodeling phenotype. The upregulation of GFAP and other cytoskeletal genes is consistent with astrogliosis. The later upregulation of hedgehog and EGF signaling components suggests further functional adaptation or stress response.\n\n**Spatial and Morphological Validation**  \nSpatial transcriptomics (MERFISH) confirmed the increased abundance of protoplasmic astrocytes in tissue sections from donors with higher CPS, and the upregulation of GFAP and other marker genes was validated at the spatial level. The spatial distribution of astrocyte subtypes matched expectations from the BRAIN Initiative reference and prior studies.\n\n**Temporal Dynamics and Disease Trajectory**  \nThe increase in protoplasmic astrocytes and their molecular activation occurred early in the disease pseudoprogression, preceding or coinciding with the exponential rise in amyloid and tau pathology and the loss of vulnerable neuronal subtypes. This suggests that astrocyte reactivity is an early event in AD pathogenesis.\n\n**Comparison with External Datasets**  \nReplication in external datasets (Green et al. 2023, Mathys et al. 2023) was limited by differences in astrocyte subtype resolution, but the original studies also reported an increase in at least one protoplasmic astrocyte subtype with AD. The SEA-AD taxonomy provided higher granularity and confidence in subtype-specific changes.\n\n**Modulators and Metrics**  \nNo significant modulation of astrocyte changes by sex, age, or APOE4 status was detected after covariate adjustment. The increase in protoplasmic astrocytes was robust to technical and demographic confounders.\n\n**Gene Regulatory Networks**  \nNo astrocyte-specific gene regulatory network analysis was highlighted for astrocytes in this study.\n\n**Cell-Cell Communication**  \nThe upregulation of adhesion and guidance molecules suggests altered astrocyte-neuron and astrocyte-astrocyte interactions, but specific ligand-receptor analyses were not detailed for astrocytes.\n\n**Aging/Disease Trajectories**  \nAstrocyte activation and proliferation were among the earliest glial changes detected along the CPS, preceding late-stage changes in oligodendrocytes and OPCs.\n\n**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**  \nAstrocytic APOE downregulation was observed, but no direct eQTL or genetic integration was reported for astrocyte subtypes.\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nAstrocytes, specifically the protoplasmic subtype, are among the earliest and most robustly disease-associated glial populations in the AD cortex. Their early activation and upregulation of GFAP and adhesion/guidance molecules suggest a role in tissue remodeling, neuroinflammation, or neuroprotection. The decrease in astrocytic APOE, alongside increased microglial APOE, may have implications for lipid metabolism and amyloid processing in AD. These findings reinforce the view that astrocyte reactivity is not merely a late-stage response but may actively shape the disease environment and progression. The molecular signatures identified could serve as biomarkers of early AD or targets for therapeutic modulation of astrocyte function, though causality remains to be established (<keyFinding priority='1'>Protoplasmic astrocyte activation is an early, robust, and potentially targetable feature of AD progression</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**  \nThe SEA-AD atlas reveals that protoplasmic astrocytes (Astro_2) in the human cortex increase early and robustly with Alzheimer’s disease progression, as measured by a continuous pseudoprogression score. These astrocytes upregulate GFAP and a suite of adhesion and guidance molecules, indicating early astrogliosis and functional remodeling. Astrocytic APOE expression decreases with disease, while microglial APOE increases. These changes are independent of sex, age, or APOE4 status and are validated by spatial transcriptomics. The early and specific activation of protoplasmic astrocytes highlights their potential as biomarkers or therapeutic targets in AD.\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications (≈150 words):**  \nThis study establishes protoplasmic astrocyte activation as an early and robust feature of AD, preceding major neuronal loss and coinciding with early glial and immune responses. The molecular signatures—particularly the upregulation of GFAP, adhesion, and guidance molecules—provide a refined framework for classifying reactive astrocytes in human AD, extending and specifying prior models of astrogliosis. The observed decrease in astrocytic APOE, contrasted with its increase in microglia, suggests a shift in lipid handling and amyloid processing roles between glial cell types, warranting further mechanistic investigation. Open questions include the causal role of astrocyte activation in neuronal vulnerability, the functional consequences of altered adhesion/guidance signaling, and the potential for targeting astrocyte subtypes to modulate disease progression. The SEA-AD taxonomy offers a high-resolution reference for future studies and cross-cohort integration. No explicit contradictions with prior models were discussed; rather, the findings refine and extend existing concepts of astrocyte involvement in AD.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Tagging:**  \n<keyFinding priority='1'>Early and robust increase in protoplasmic astrocyte supertype (Astro_2) with AD progression</keyFinding>  \n<keyFinding priority='2'>Early upregulation of GFAP and adhesion/guidance molecules in protoplasmic astrocytes</keyFinding>  \n<keyFinding priority='2'>Late-stage decrease in astrocytic APOE expression</keyFinding>  \n<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>  \n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

Future studies should address astrocyte heterogeneity across additional brain regions, including white matter, and at various stages of AD progression. The lack of astrocyte activation in this dataset also suggests that therapeutic strategies targeting astrocyte subtypes may need to be tailored to specific brain regions or disease contexts.

The spatial co-localization with Mic.13 microglia suggests coordinated glial responses, warranting further investigation into astrocyte–microglia cross-talk. The lack of association with age or APOE genotype distinguishes Ast.10 from other glial subtypes, highlighting the need for targeted studies of its regulation.\n\nNo explicit contradictions with prior models are discussed; rather, the study builds on and refines existing astrocyte classification schemes. Future work should address whether targeting Ast.10 or its pathways can modify disease progression, and whether similar subtypes are present in other brain regions or neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

These AD astrocyte states are marked by downregulation of APOE and are driven by the master lysosomal regulator TFEB, which coordinates the expression of multiple AD GWAS risk genes. Notably, these subtypes do not overlap with mouse A1/A2 astrocyte states, highlighting species-specific disease mechanisms.\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications**\n\nThis work establishes a detailed atlas of astrocyte heterogeneity in the human AD brain, identifying two major disease-associated subtypes with distinct molecular and functional profiles. The finding that TFEB orchestrates a lysosomal/chaperone response and regulates multiple AD risk genes in astrocytes suggests new avenues for therapeutic intervention targeting proteostasis and lysosomal pathways. The observed downregulation of APOE in astrocytes (contrasting with its upregulation in microglia) raises questions about cell-type-specific roles of APOE in AD pathogenesis and myelination. Importantly, the lack of overlap between human AD astrocyte states and canonical mouse A1/A2 reactivity profiles calls for caution in extrapolating from animal models and underscores the need for human-specific studies. Future research should address the functional consequences of these astrocyte states in vivo, their spatial distribution, and their impact on neuronal health and disease progression, as well as validate these findings with morphological and spatial techniques."

For most genes, the effect of AD status is modest, with only a minority of genes in each cell type showing >5% variance explained by disease.

For astrocytes, the observed downregulation of cholesterol biosynthesis and upregulation of ERBB signaling align with prior suggestions of metabolic and stress-related dysfunction in AD, but the lack of further astrocyte subtype resolution limits mechanistic insight. The findings do not directly reference or challenge established astrocyte classification schemes (e.g., A1/A2, disease-associated astrocytes), nor do they integrate genetic risk or spatial context. Open questions include whether these pathway changes reflect specific astrocyte subpopulations, how they relate to disease progression or regional vulnerability, and whether they are causally linked to neurodegeneration. Future work should incorporate spatial, longitudinal, and multi-omic approaches to refine astrocyte state definitions and clarify their roles in AD. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

The mediation of trans-eQTLs (e.g., RERE→AUTS2) further highlights astrocytes as active participants in gene regulatory networks relevant to schizophrenia. These findings align with, but also extend, prior models that emphasized microglia in AD, by demonstrating a substantial astrocyte contribution to disease risk architecture. Open questions include the functional consequences of these regulatory variants, the existence of finer astrocyte subtypes, and the interplay between astrocyte regulation and other glial or neuronal populations.

However, the VEGFA–SMAD3 axis was modulated by amyloid pathology: Aβ exposure in zebrafish reduced astroglial vegfaa and increased pericytic smad3a.\n\n**Spatial and Morphological Validation**\nRNAscope and immunohistochemistry confirmed VEGFA expression in astrocytes and its reduction in AD, as well as increased pericytic SMAD3.

Open questions include the precise causal role of VEGFA loss in astrocytes, the functional consequences of SMAD3 upregulation in pericytes, and whether restoring VEGFA signaling can rescue BBB integrity and cognitive function. The astrocyte subtypes identified here largely align with previously described homeostatic and reactive states, but the study emphasizes the spectrum and overlap of disease-associated changes.

Astrocyte gene expression shows moderate donor-specific variability, but this is largely unexplained by age, sex, ancestry, or disease status. Notably, the gene LRRC37A—located in a MAPT haplotype region linked to neurodegeneration—shows high interindividual variability in astrocytes, suggesting possible genetic modulation. No disease- or pathology-associated astrocyte subtypes were identified, and astrocyte abundance remains stable across epilepsy, tumor, and control cases.\n\n---\n\n2) **Detailed Summary (≈800–1000 words)**\n\n<metadata>\n- Nelson Johansen, Saroja Somasundaram, Kyle J.

Nearly 400,000 nuclei were profiled, and cell types were mapped to a high-resolution taxonomy (125 supertypes, including astrocytes) using iterative computational classification. Quality control and doublet removal were rigorously applied. Cell type assignments were validated by marker gene expression and cross-referenced with a neurotypical postmortem reference. Genetic effects were assessed via eQTL analysis.\n</methods>\n\n<findings>\nAstrocytes were robustly identified as a major non-neuronal cell class, forming a single, transcriptionally distinct supertype across all donors. The study did not report further subdivision of astrocytes into discrete subtypes or disease-associated states within the sampled adult cortex. Marker genes defining the astrocyte population included canonical astrocytic markers (e.g., GFAP, AQP4, SLC1A2), though the paper does not provide a detailed marker list for astrocyte subtypes, reflecting the absence of further subclassification in their taxonomy.\n\nAstrocyte abundance was highly consistent across individuals, with no significant differences detected between epilepsy, tumor, or control cases, nor across brain regions (MTG vs. FRO). This stability was confirmed both in the neurosurgical cohort and in comparisons with the SEA-AD postmortem dataset. The lack of significant abundance shifts contrasts with other cell types (e.g., parvalbumin interneurons, oligodendrocyte progenitor cells), which showed disease- or age-associated changes. <keyFinding priority='2'>Astrocyte abundance is stable across disease states and demographic variables in adult cortex.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nGene expression variability in astrocytes was moderate compared to other cell types. Variation partitioning analysis revealed that most astrocyte gene expression differences between individuals could not be explained by measured factors such as age, sex, ancestry, disease status, or technical batch. The residual (unexplained) component accounted for the majority of variance, suggesting either unmeasured biological factors or stochastic variation. <keyFinding priority='2'>Astrocyte gene expression is moderately variable across individuals, but this is largely unexplained by known demographic or disease factors.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nA notable exception was the gene LRRC37A, which showed high interindividual variability in astrocytes (as well as in certain neuronal types). LRRC37A is located in the MAPT 17q21.31 haplotype region, which is associated with neurodegenerative disease risk. The study’s eQTL analysis identified genetic variants in this region as drivers of LRRC37A expression variability in astrocytes, suggesting a possible link between genetic background and astrocyte function. <keyFinding priority='1'>LRRC37A expression in astrocytes is highly variable between individuals and is modulated by MAPT haplotype-associated genetic variants.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nNo evidence was found for disease-associated astrocyte subtypes, such as those reported in neurodegenerative or inflammatory contexts (e.g., A1/A2, reactive astrocytes), within the sampled adult cortex.

The only major genetic modulator identified was LRRC37A, linked to the MAPT locus.\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nAstrocytes in this study do not show disease-specific roles or subtype shifts in epilepsy, tumor, or dementia, suggesting that, in the absence of overt pathology, their abundance and transcriptional state are tightly regulated in the adult cortex. The high interindividual variability of LRRC37A in astrocytes, driven by MAPT haplotype, may have implications for neurodegenerative disease risk or progression, but this remains speculative. No astrocyte-derived biomarkers or therapeutic targets are proposed based on these data. <keyFinding priority='2'>Astrocyte stability in abundance and transcriptional state may serve as a baseline for future studies of disease-associated reactivity.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**\n\nThis study establishes a robust baseline for astrocyte identity and variability in the adult human cortex, showing that astrocytes are remarkably stable in both abundance and transcriptional profile across a large, diverse cohort. The absence of disease- or pathology-associated astrocyte subtypes in this dataset contrasts with findings from neurodegenerative or acute injury models, suggesting that such states may be rare or absent in non-pathological adult cortex. The identification of LRRC37A as a highly variable, genetically modulated gene in astrocytes highlights the potential for genetic background to influence astrocyte function, particularly in the context of MAPT haplotype and neurodegeneration. Future studies should investigate whether astrocyte subtypes emerge in more severe or chronic disease states, or in other brain regions, and whether LRRC37A variability translates to functional differences relevant to disease. The lack of alignment with previously described reactive or disease-associated astrocyte states is explicitly noted by the authors, and no contradictions with prior classification schemes are reported. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

The authors explicitly state that the T09 (CD161+/LTB+) T cell signature did not overlap with astrocyte or microglial gene expression profiles, referencing a publicly available single-cell brain dataset (Schirmer et al., 2019) to confirm that developmental brain-resident cells, including astrocytes, did not enrich for the T09 signature.

No genetic or demographic modulators of astrocyte states were reported.\n\n---\n\n**Detailed Summary**\n\nThis study by Kaufmann et al. (2021) investigates the immune cell landscape in multiple sclerosis (MS), with a primary focus on identifying and tracking CNS-homing T cells using multimodal single-cell and spatial transcriptomic approaches. While the central findings revolve around a pathogenic CD161+/LTB+ Th17/Tfh-like CD4+ T cell population (T09), astrocytes were included in the spatial transcriptomic analyses as part of the broader brain cell milieu.\n\nAstrocytes were not the main subject of investigation, and the study does not report the identification of distinct astrocyte subtypes, disease-associated states, or significant changes in astrocyte proportions between MS and control brains. Instead, astrocyte markers (such as GFAP) were used in immunohistochemistry to delineate brain regions and assess tissue integrity for spatial transcriptomics. In the spatial RNA sequencing analysis of post mortem brain tissue from progressive MS patients and controls, the authors specifically tested whether the T09 T cell signature could be confounded by expression in resident glial cells, including astrocytes.\n\nTo address this, the authors cross-referenced their T09 signature with a publicly available single-cell brain dataset (Schirmer et al., 2019), confirming that neither astrocytes nor microglia showed enrichment for the T09 gene set. This served as a critical negative control, ensuring that the observed spatial enrichment of the T09 signature in MS brain tissue was specific to infiltrating T cells and not due to resident glial populations. The spatial transcriptomics data revealed focal enrichment of the T09 signature in both white matter lesions and gray matter regions of MS brains, but not in controls, further supporting the specificity of immune cell localization.\n\nNo pathway enrichment, gene regulatory network, or cell-cell communication analyses were performed for astrocytes. The study’s functional and mechanistic analyses were restricted to T cell populations, particularly those involved in CNS migration and encephalitogenicity. There was no modeling of astrocyte aging or disease progression trajectories, nor were any genetic or multi-omic integrations performed for astrocyte populations.\n\nThe absence of astrocyte findings is explicitly acknowledged by the authors, who note that their approach did not identify significant differences in subpopulation frequencies or transcriptomic states for resident brain cells, including astrocytes, between MS and control samples. This is attributed in part to the high variability and limited sample size inherent in cross-sectional human studies.\n\n<keyFinding priority='3'>Astrocyte signatures were used as negative controls in spatial transcriptomics to validate the specificity of T cell localization analyses in MS brain tissue. No disease-associated astrocyte subtypes or significant transcriptomic changes were identified.</keyFinding>\n<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nThus, the study’s main contribution regarding astrocytes is methodological: by demonstrating that astrocyte (and microglial) gene expression does not confound the identification of CNS-infiltrating T cells, the authors strengthen the validity of their immune cell–centric findings.\n\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nAstrocytes are not implicated as direct contributors to MS progression in this study. The data do not support a role for astrocyte subtypes as biomarkers or therapeutic targets in the context of CNS immune cell colonization or the transition to progressive MS. Instead, the findings reinforce the specificity of T cell–mediated mechanisms in MS pathology, as astrocyte signatures did not overlap with the pathogenic T cell populations identified.\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications**\n\nThe lack of significant astrocyte findings in this study highlights the specificity of immune cell–driven mechanisms in MS progression, at least as captured by the spatial transcriptomic and single-cell approaches used here. The use of astrocyte signatures as negative controls is a methodological strength, ensuring that immune cell localization analyses are not confounded by resident glial expression. However, the absence of astrocyte subtyping or activation state analysis leaves open the question of whether more sensitive or targeted approaches might reveal subtle astrocyte heterogeneity or disease associations in MS. Future studies with larger sample sizes, higher spatial resolution, or astrocyte-focused profiling may be needed to fully elucidate the role of astrocytes in MS progression. The findings are consistent with prior models that emphasize immune cell infiltration over glial cell-intrinsic changes in driving MS pathology, and no explicit contradictions with existing astrocyte literature are discussed by the authors.\n\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

Cell types were annotated using canonical marker genes, including AQP4 and GFAP for astrocytes. Mutational burden was quantified per cell and per cell type, and pathway/gene-level enrichment analyses were performed.\n</methods>\n\n<findings>\nAstrocytes were robustly identified as a distinct cluster using canonical markers (AQP4, GFAP), with no evidence for further subclustering or disease-associated astrocyte subtypes reported in this dataset. The main finding is a significant increase in somatic mutational burden in astrocytes from AlzD individuals compared to controls (<keyFinding priority='1'>), with a 24% increase (p=0.038) (<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>). This enrichment was observed across all major mutation classes (synonymous, missense, loss-of-function), and was more pronounced for highly deleterious variants (CADD>30).\n\nThe increased mutational burden in astrocytes was not attributable to changes in cell type proportions, as the analysis controlled for cell composition and found the effect to be cell-intrinsic. Glial cells overall (including astrocytes) showed a 34.6% higher mutational burden than neurons, consistent with their proliferative capacity, and this burden correlated with age (r=0.26 for glia), reflecting aging-associated mutational signatures (C-to-T and T-to-C transitions) (<keyFinding priority='2'>).\n\nImportantly, the study found that somatic mutations in astrocytes were enriched in known AlzD genes and pathways. Specifically, the aggregate of 12 bona fide AlzD genes (including CLU, CR1, PICALM, etc.) showed significant mutational enrichment in astrocytes (8 mutations in AlzD vs. 2 in controls, q=0.025) (<keyFinding priority='1'>). Pathway analysis revealed that astrocytic mutations in AlzD were concentrated in biological processes relevant to disease, such as lipid metabolism (e.g., CRYAB, CNP), cytoskeletal regulation (e.g., MACF1), and proteostasis. Notably, MACF1, a microtubule-actin crosslinking factor, was highlighted as a gene with increased mutational burden in both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, implicating cytoskeletal dysfunction in glial pathology (<keyFinding priority='2'>).\n\nWhile the study did not report distinct disease-associated astrocyte subtypes, it did identify a transcriptionally distinct “senescent” cell cluster, which was highly enriched for mutational burden and more prevalent in AlzD. However, these senescent cells lacked clear astrocytic identity and were not classified as astrocyte subtypes. Thus, within the canonical astrocyte population, no further subtypes or states were delineated.\n\nGene expression analysis showed that higher mutational burden at the single-cell level correlated with altered expression profiles, suggesting a genotype-to-phenotype relationship. However, this relationship was more pronounced in neurons and oligodendrocytes, with less detailed analysis for astrocytes. The study did not report spatial or morphological validation specific to astrocytes, nor did it identify astrocyte-specific regulatory networks or ligand-receptor interactions.\n\nHost factors such as age were associated with increased mutational burden in glia, but sex did not significantly affect astrocyte mutational load. The study did not report associations with APOE genotype or other genetic risk factors specifically for astrocytes.\n\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>  \nThe authors note that previous studies of brain mosaicism focused almost exclusively on neurons, and their finding of strong glial (including astrocyte) involvement is a novel extension rather than a contradiction.\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nThe increased somatic mutational burden in astrocytes in AlzD suggests that astrocytic genomic instability may contribute to disease pathogenesis, potentially through disruption of lipid metabolism, cytoskeletal integrity, and proteostasis (<keyFinding priority='1'>). These findings support a model in which glial cells, alongside neurons, are key cellular targets of somatic mutations in Alzheimer’s dementia. While the study does not establish causality, the cell-type-specific enrichment of mutations in astrocytes and their concentration in AlzD-relevant genes/pathways point to possible mechanisms by which astrocyte dysfunction could drive or exacerbate neurodegeneration. The results also raise the possibility that somatic mutations in astrocytes could serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets, though further validation is needed (<confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>).\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**  \nThis study establishes that astrocytes in the aging and Alzheimer’s disease brain accumulate a significant burden of somatic mutations, particularly in genes and pathways implicated in lipid metabolism and cytoskeletal regulation. The lack of distinct astrocyte subtypes or states in this dataset suggests that mutational burden is a feature of the canonical astrocyte population, rather than a specific disease-associated astrocyte state. This contrasts with some prior scRNA-seq studies that have reported reactive or disease-associated astrocyte subtypes, highlighting a potential limitation of the current dataset or methodology (<contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag> if the authors had discussed this, but in this case, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>). Open questions include whether higher-resolution or spatially resolved approaches would reveal additional astrocyte heterogeneity, and whether the observed mutational burden is a driver or consequence of astrocyte dysfunction in AlzD.

Instead, the emphasis was on their functional state.\n\n**Differential Gene Expression & Pathway Enrichment:**  \nAstrocytes in DRE tissue upregulated pro-inflammatory genes, most notably IL1B (encoding IL-1β), as demonstrated by both transcriptomic data and IHC. This upregulation was not observed in control brain tissue. The study also noted increased expression of other inflammatory mediators in the broader glial compartment, but IL-1β was the most prominent astrocyte-derived cytokine highlighted.\n\n<keyFinding priority='1'>Astrocytes in DRE lesions robustly express IL-1β, a key pro-inflammatory cytokine, as validated by both single-cell transcriptomics and multispectral IHC.

The spatial distribution of IL-1β+ astrocytes was consistent across multiple DRE patients and brain regions, supporting the generalizability of this finding.\n\n<keyFinding priority='2'>Astrocytic IL-1β production in DRE lesions is spatially validated and consistently observed across patients and sampled brain regions, indicating a conserved pro-inflammatory astrocyte response in refractory epilepsy.</keyFinding>\n<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Modulators & Metrics:**  \nThe study did not identify specific genetic, demographic, or clinical modulators (e.g., age, sex, genotype) of the astrocyte pro-inflammatory response.

However, the presence of astrocytic IL-1β suggests potential paracrine signaling to both microglia and infiltrating immune cells, contributing to the broader inflammatory milieu.\n\n**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  \nNo temporal or pseudotime analysis of astrocyte states was performed. The data are cross-sectional, and the study does not address whether the pro-inflammatory astrocyte phenotype represents a transient or persistent state in disease progression.\n\n**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  \nNo integration with genetic risk variants or multi-omic data was performed for astrocytes in this study.\n\n**Summary of Negative Findings:**  \nThe paper does not report the identification of distinct astrocyte subtypes (e.g., homeostatic vs. disease-associated) or significant changes in astrocyte abundance. The primary and robust finding is the upregulation of IL-1β in astrocytes within DRE lesions.\n\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nAstrocytes in DRE lesions adopt a pro-inflammatory phenotype, characterized by IL-1β production, which may contribute to the chronic inflammatory microenvironment implicated in epileptogenesis. While causality cannot be established from this cross-sectional data, the presence of IL-1β+ astrocytes alongside activated microglia and infiltrating immune cells suggests a potential role for astrocyte-mediated cytokine signaling in sustaining or amplifying neuroinflammation in refractory epilepsy. These findings support the rationale for targeting glial inflammation, including astrocytic cytokine production, as a therapeutic strategy in DRE.\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**\n\nThis study establishes that astrocytes in human DRE lesions consistently upregulate IL-1β, validated at both the transcript and protein levels, and that this phenotype is spatially widespread across patients and brain regions. However, the absence of further astrocyte subclustering or analysis of canonical reactive (A1/A2) or homeostatic states leaves open questions about the heterogeneity and functional diversity of astrocytes in epilepsy. Future research should address whether distinct astrocyte subtypes exist in DRE, how their inflammatory profiles evolve over disease progression, and whether they interact directly with microglia or infiltrating immune cells via specific ligand-receptor axes. Integration with genetic, longitudinal, or multi-omic data could clarify whether astrocyte activation is a driver or consequence of epileptogenic inflammation. The findings align with, but do not contradict, prior models of glial involvement in epilepsy, and highlight astrocytic IL-1β as a candidate biomarker or therapeutic target for modulating neuroinflammation in refractory epilepsy.\n\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

Cell type annotation was based on canonical markers, and multiomic integration enabled mapping of cis-regulatory elements (cREs), differential gene expression, and chromatin interactions at cell type resolution. Validation included CRISPR-Cas9 editing and eQTL integration.\n</methods>\n\nQuick Reference:\nAstrocytes in the PD substantia nigra exhibit distinct transcriptional and epigenomic alterations, including both up- and down-regulated gene expression and cis-regulatory elements (cREs). While astrocyte-specific cREs are less enriched for PD GWAS risk variants than oligodendrocytes or microglia, astrocytes show disease-associated changes in pathways related to neurogenesis, cellular differentiation, and stress response. These alterations are not strongly modulated by major genetic risk factors but are implicated in broader glial responses to PD pathology. <keyFinding priority='2'></keyFinding>\n\nDetailed Summary:\n<findings>\nAstrocytes were robustly identified in the SN using canonical markers (AQP4, GFAP) in both snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq datasets. The study did not report a significant change in the overall proportion of astrocytes between PD and control SN, focusing instead on molecular and regulatory alterations.\n\n**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment:**  \nAstrocytes in PD showed both up- and down-regulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Down-regulated DEGs in astrocytes were enriched for pathways related to neurogenesis regulation, while up-regulated DEGs were associated with cellular differentiation and stress response (see Fig. 1E, Fig. 2C). These findings suggest a shift in astrocyte functional state in PD, potentially reflecting altered support for neuronal health and glial reactivity. <keyFinding priority='2'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Cis-Regulatory Element (cRE) Dysregulation:**  \nThe study identified both up- and down-regulated cREs in astrocytes using bulk H3K27ac ChIP-seq with cellularity correction, mapped to cell types via snATAC-seq. While the majority of dysregulated cREs were cell type–specific, astrocyte cREs did not show the strongest enrichment for PD GWAS risk variants compared to oligodendrocytes and microglia (see Fig. 4A-B). However, astrocyte cREs were implicated in the regulation of genes involved in glial differentiation and neural tube development, particularly among up-regulated cRE targets (see Fig. 6B, C7 cluster). <keyFinding priority='2'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  \nThe study did not report further subclustering of astrocytes into distinct molecular subtypes or states beyond the main astrocyte cluster. There is no explicit mention of homeostatic versus disease-associated astrocyte subpopulations, nor of spatial or morphological validation specific to astrocytes. The main findings relate to pathway-level changes and regulatory element dysregulation rather than discrete astrocyte subtypes. <keyFinding priority='3'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Integration with Chromatin and Genetic Data:**  \nAstrocyte cREs were included in the high-resolution 3D chromatin contact maps, allowing assignment of putative target genes. Among the 656 putative PD genes identified via the ABC model, 233 were assigned to astrocytes. These genes were enriched for processes such as glial cell differentiation and neural tube development (C7 cluster, Fig. 6A-B), suggesting a role for astrocyte regulatory changes in broader neurodevelopmental and glial responses in PD. However, astrocyte cREs and their target genes were less frequently linked to PD GWAS risk variants than those of oligodendrocytes or microglia. <keyFinding priority='2'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Modulators & Metrics:**  \nNo strong evidence was presented for modulation of astrocyte states by host factors (age, sex, APOE genotype) or by specific PD risk alleles.

Most motif disruption and TF binding analyses focused on other cell types.\n\n**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  \nThere was no explicit pseudotime or trajectory analysis for astrocytes. The modular gene expression analysis (Fig. 6) suggests that astrocyte regulatory changes may be part of a broader glial response to PD progression, but temporal dynamics were not directly modeled.\n\n**Spatial Analysis:**  \nNo spatial transcriptomics or in situ validation specific to astrocyte subpopulations was reported.\n\n**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  \nAstrocyte cREs and their target genes were included in the multiomic integration, but were not the primary cell type linked to PD risk loci or eQTLs.\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nAstrocytes in the PD substantia nigra display altered gene expression and regulatory element activity, particularly in pathways related to neurogenesis, cellular differentiation, and stress response. While these changes may reflect a shift toward a reactive or neuroprotective glial phenotype, the study does not provide direct evidence for causal roles in PD pathogenesis. Astrocyte-specific regulatory changes are less strongly associated with genetic risk for PD than those in oligodendrocytes or microglia, suggesting that astrocyte alterations may be more reflective of secondary or compensatory responses rather than primary drivers of disease. Potential therapeutic implications include targeting astrocyte-mediated support functions or glial differentiation pathways, but further work is needed to clarify their mechanistic roles. <keyFinding priority='2'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n</clinical>\n\nResearch Implications:\nThis study provides a comprehensive multiomic map of astrocyte molecular alterations in PD, highlighting changes in gene expression and regulatory element activity related to glial differentiation and neurogenesis. However, the lack of astrocyte subclustering or identification of discrete disease-associated astrocyte states limits mechanistic insight. Future research should focus on resolving astrocyte heterogeneity in PD, including identification of reactive or neurotoxic subtypes, spatial mapping, and functional validation of candidate regulatory elements and target genes. The relatively weak association of astrocyte cREs with PD risk variants suggests that astrocyte changes may be downstream of primary disease processes, but their roles in neuroprotection or neuroinflammation remain important open questions. The findings are consistent with, but do not substantially extend, current models of astrocyte involvement in PD, and no explicit contradictions with prior data are discussed by the authors. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

While astrocyte proportions remain relatively stable across neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases, disease-associated astrocyte subtypes show specific gene expression changes—particularly in Alzheimer’s disease (AD)—with upregulation of stress response, protein folding, and metabolic pathways. Notably, late-stage AD is marked by increased astrocytic expression of chaperone-mediated protein folding genes, which may be damaging, and these signatures are modulated by disease stage and pathology burden rather than genetic risk factors such as APOE genotype.\n\n---\n\n2) **Detailed Summary**\n\n<metadata>\nDonghoon Lee† et al., 2024, medRxiv preprint (https://doi.org/10.1101/2024.10.31.24316513)\nDisease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD), diffuse Lewy body disease (DLBD), vascular dementia (Vas), Parkinson’s disease (PD), tauopathy, frontotemporal dementia (FTD), schizophrenia (SCZ), bipolar disorder (BD)\n</metadata>\n\n<methods>\nSingle-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on DLPFC tissue from 1,494 donors, yielding over 6.3 million nuclei. Cell type annotation followed a hierarchical taxonomy, with astrocytes (Astro) defined as one of eight major classes and further subdivided into subtypes using iterative clustering. Spatial transcriptomics (Xenium) validated cell type localization. Disease associations were analyzed using compositional variation, differential gene expression (Dreamlet), and trajectory modeling (VAE-based pseudotime).\n</methods>\n\n<findings>\nAstrocytes were robustly identified as a major glial class in the DLPFC, with further subclassification into at least three transcriptionally distinct subtypes: Astro_GRIA1, Astro_PLXCR1, and Astro_WIF1. These subtypes were defined by differential expression of canonical and subtype-specific marker genes (e.g., GRIA1, PLXCR1, WIF1), as shown in the circular taxonomy (Fig. 2a) and validated by spatial transcriptomics.\n\nAstrocyte proportions remained relatively stable across neurodegenerative (NDDs) and neuropsychiatric (NPDs) disorders, with no significant compositional shifts detected in cross-disorder analyses (Fig. 4b, Supplementary Table 3). This suggests that, unlike microglia or vascular cells, astrocyte abundance is not a primary driver of disease-related cellular remodeling in the DLPFC. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nHowever, astrocytes exhibited disease- and stage-specific transcriptional changes. In cross-disorder differential expression analyses, astrocytes showed upregulation of genes involved in mRNA splicing, protein localization, and stress response pathways, but these signatures were largely shared across multiple diseases and not specific to AD or other NDDs (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Fig. 5a). After removing these universal signatures, residual disease-specific effects in astrocytes were modest compared to neurons and microglia. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nFocusing on AD, astrocyte subtypes did not show significant compositional changes with increasing amyloid plaque (CERAD), tau pathology (Braak), or cognitive impairment (Fig. 6a, Supplementary Fig. 6a). Nonetheless, astrocytes displayed robust differential gene expression in AD, characterized by upregulation of stress response and protein folding pathways, particularly in late-stage disease. Notably, chaperone-mediated protein folding and assembly genes (e.g., HSP family) were upregulated in astrocytes as AD pathology progressed (Fig. 7c, Supplementary Figs. 9–11). <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nTrajectory modeling revealed that astrocytic gene expression changes in AD are nonlinear and stage-dependent. Early AD stages showed modest upregulation of metabolic and stress response genes, while late stages were marked by pronounced increases in chaperone-mediated protein folding and negative regulation of lipid transport (Fig. 7c, Supplementary Figs. 9–11). These late-stage changes were associated with decreased resilience to dementia, suggesting a potentially damaging role for astrocytic stress responses in advanced AD. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nPathway enrichment analyses confirmed that astrocyte DEGs in AD are enriched for protein folding, chaperone activity, and metabolic processes (Supplementary Figs. 9–11).

Instead, their disease-associated signatures were dominated by cellular stress and proteostasis mechanisms.\n\nNo significant modulation of astrocyte subtypes or gene expression by major genetic risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype, MAPT haplotype) was reported for astrocytes, in contrast to findings in microglia and neurons. Host factors such as age and sex were not highlighted as major modulators of astrocyte disease responses in this study.\n\nSpatial transcriptomics confirmed the laminar and regional distribution of astrocyte subtypes in the DLPFC, supporting the robustness of the subtype taxonomy (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Table 2).\n\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> The authors did not report explicit contradictions with prior astrocyte models, but noted that astrocyte compositional stability contrasts with the more dynamic changes observed in microglia and vascular cells.\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nAstrocytes in the DLPFC do not undergo major compositional shifts in neurodegenerative or neuropsychiatric diseases, but exhibit disease- and stage-specific transcriptional changes, particularly in AD. The late-stage upregulation of chaperone-mediated protein folding genes in astrocytes may contribute to proteostatic stress and reduced resilience to dementia, potentially exacerbating disease progression. These findings suggest that astrocytic stress responses, rather than immune activation or proliferation, are key features of astrocyte involvement in AD and may represent targets for therapeutic intervention aimed at modulating proteostasis or cellular stress pathways in glia. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n3) **Research Implications**\n\nThis study provides a comprehensive, population-scale atlas of astrocyte heterogeneity and disease-associated transcriptional changes in the human DLPFC. The identification of stable astrocyte proportions across diseases, coupled with robust, stage-dependent upregulation of stress response and protein folding pathways in AD, refines our understanding of astrocyte involvement in neurodegeneration. The late-stage, potentially damaging chaperone response in astrocytes aligns with emerging models of glial proteostatic stress but diverges from prior studies emphasizing immune or inflammatory astrocyte activation in AD. The lack of strong genetic or host modulation of astrocyte responses suggests that these changes are primarily driven by disease pathology rather than inherited risk. Open questions include the functional consequences of astrocytic chaperone upregulation, its reversibility, and whether targeting astrocyte proteostasis can mitigate cognitive decline. The astrocyte subtypes and marker genes identified here are broadly concordant with recent human cortical atlases, supporting the robustness of the taxonomy. Future work should integrate multi-omic and spatial data to dissect astrocyte-neuron and astrocyte-microglia interactions in disease progression.\n\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> The authors did not report explicit conflicts with prior astrocyte models, but their findings emphasize proteostatic stress over immune activation as the dominant astrocyte response in AD, which may represent a shift from earlier paradigms."

The molecular signature (motile cilia genes, FOXJ1) and spatial restriction to the glial scar suggest a role in chronic tissue remodeling, distinct from the inflammatory or phagocytic functions of other astrocyte subtypes. The findings align with recent reports of cilia-associated astrocytes in other CNS injury models, but the extreme cilia length and lesion specificity are novel. Open questions include the functional role of these cilia (e.g., signaling, debris clearance, scar maintenance), their origin (transdifferentiation vs. expansion), and whether they represent a therapeutic target for modulating scar formation or chronic lesion repair. No explicit contradictions with prior MS astrocyte models are discussed, but the identification of this subtype challenges the traditional binary view of reactive vs. homeostatic astrocytes in MS.\n\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

Astrocyte alterations are highly consistent across brain regions and are accompanied by reduced C9orf72 expression, with evidence for concordant changes in chromatin accessibility and histone acetylation.\n</quickReference>\n\n<findings>\nAstrocytes were among the most transcriptionally disrupted cell types in C9-ALS, with the largest number of differentially expressed (DE) genes among non-neuronal populations in both motor and frontal cortices. The magnitude of astrocyte dysregulation was greater in motor cortex, but the direction and identity of DE genes were highly consistent across regions (Pearson r > 0.68).\n\n**Astrocyte Subtype Characterization:**\nThe study did not subdivide astrocytes into multiple molecular subtypes but instead identified a robust, disease-associated activation state in C9-ALS, distinct from homeostatic astrocytes in controls. This state is defined by:\n\n- **Key Upregulated Marker Genes:** GFAP (10.3-fold in motor, 2.4-fold in frontal), CD44 (9.4-fold in motor, 3.7-fold in frontal), CHI3L1 (10-fold in both regions), and TGFB2 (1.56–1.95-fold). These genes are canonical markers of astrocyte reactivity and structural remodeling.\n- **Functional Signature:** Upregulated genes were enriched for pathways related to cell adhesion and extracellular matrix (ITGA6-7, CLU, COL4A2), actin cytoskeleton (ACTN1, PALLD), and cell migration (CRB2, CORO1C), indicating cytoskeletal and cell-surface remodeling. There was also upregulation of ATP2B4 (plasma membrane Ca2+ ATPase), suggesting altered calcium handling.\n- **Downregulated Genes:** RANBP3L (3-fold down in motor cortex), involved in nucleocytoplasmic transport, and C9orf72 itself, which was significantly reduced in astrocytes (as well as in excitatory neurons and oligodendrocytes).\n- **Validation:** Upregulation of GFAP and CD44 was confirmed at the protein level by Western blot and immunofluorescence, which showed increased GFAP throughout astrocyte cell bodies and processes in C9-ALS motor cortex. TGFB2 protein was also increased.\n- **Epigenomic Correlates:** Concordant increases in chromatin accessibility (snATAC-seq) and H3K27ac (ChIP-seq) were observed at upregulated astrocyte loci (e.g., GFAP, CD44, HSPB1, TPM4, CNTNAP3), with strong correlation between transcriptomic and epigenomic changes in astrocytes (Spearman r = 0.33 for H3K27ac vs. RNA-seq).\n- **Disease Association:** The astrocyte activation state was strongly associated with C9-ALS diagnosis, with no evidence for similar changes in controls. The same activation markers were upregulated in C9-FTD astrocytes, but the overall pattern of DE genes was largely distinct between C9-ALS and C9-FTD.\n- **Comparison to Other Diseases:** Some overlap with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) astrocyte DE genes (e.g., upregulation of CD44 and MAOB), but the majority of C9-ALS astrocyte DE genes were distinct (Jaccard index <0.14).\n- **Modulators:** The study did not report significant modulation of astrocyte activation by age, sex, or genotype beyond the presence of the C9orf72 repeat expansion.\n- **Spatial/Morphological Validation:** Immunofluorescence confirmed increased GFAP immunoreactivity and morphological changes consistent with astrocyte activation in C9-ALS motor cortex.\n- **Trajectory/Stage:** No explicit pseudotime or trajectory analysis was performed for astrocytes, but the activation state was interpreted as a disease-associated endpoint.\n\n<keyFinding priority='1'>\nAstrocytes in C9-ALS display a robust, disease-associated activation state marked by strong upregulation of GFAP, CD44, and CHI3L1, with functional enrichment for cytoskeletal remodeling and cell adhesion, and these changes are validated at both transcript and protein levels.\n</keyFinding>\n<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n<keyFinding priority='2'>\nDownregulation of C9orf72 and RANBP3L in astrocytes suggests involvement in nucleocytoplasmic transport and potential links to ALS pathogenesis, but causality cannot be established due to cross-sectional design.\n</keyFinding>\n<confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n<keyFinding priority='2'>\nConcordant changes in chromatin accessibility and H3K27ac at upregulated astrocyte loci provide strong evidence for epigenomic reprogramming underlying astrocyte activation in C9-ALS.\n</keyFinding>\n<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n<keyFinding priority='3'>\nAstrocyte activation markers are also upregulated in C9-FTD and AD, but the overall transcriptomic signature in C9-ALS astrocytes is largely distinct from these other diseases.\n</keyFinding>\n<confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nAstrocyte activation and structural remodeling are prominent features of C9-ALS pathology, with upregulation of GFAP, CD44, and CHI3L1 serving as robust molecular markers.

The lack of further astrocyte subtype resolution in this study limits direct comparison to other classification schemes. The distinct transcriptomic and epigenomic signature in C9-ALS astrocytes, compared to C9-FTD and AD, highlights the need for disease- and context-specific models.

The authors did not report further subclustering of astrocytes, nor did they describe the presence of distinct subtypes or states (e.g., A1/A2, DAA) within the astrocyte compartment. <keyFinding priority='3'>Astrocytes in both ALS and control samples were characterized by a homeostatic transcriptomic profile.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Modulators & Metrics:**  \nNo significant modulation of astrocyte state by age, sex, or genetic risk factors (e.g., ALS–FTD GWAS loci) was reported.

Spatial transcriptomic validation and morphological analyses focused on neurons and glia other than astrocytes.\n\n**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  \nNo evidence was presented for astrocyte state transitions along aging or disease progression trajectories.

Unlike microglia and oligodendrocytes, astrocytes do not appear to undergo major functional reprogramming or contribute to the selective vulnerability of extratelencephalic neurons in ALS.

Future studies with larger cohorts, additional brain regions (e.g., spinal cord, subcortical structures), and integration of spatial transcriptomics or proteomics may be needed to uncover subtle or region-specific astrocyte responses.

Importantly, neither schizophrenia nor age altered the relative abundance of these subtypes, indicating that disease and aging effects are not due to shifts in astrocyte subtype composition.\n\nA major discovery is the identification of a multicellular gene expression program, SNAP (Synaptic Neuron and Astrocyte Program), which is co-expressed in neurons and astrocytes and declines with both age and schizophrenia. SNAP was identified via latent factor analysis (LF4), which captured coordinated expression of synaptic genes in neurons and a distinct set of genes in astrocytes. In astrocytes, SNAP (specifically the SNAP-a component, derived from cNMF factorization) is characterized by upregulation of genes involved in:\n- **Synaptic adhesion**: NRXN1, NTM, CTNND2, LSAMP, GPM6A, LRRC4C, LRRTM4, EPHB1\n- **Cholesterol and fatty acid biosynthesis**: SREBF1, SREBF2, ACACA, FASN, HMGCS1, HMGCR, IDI1, TM7SF2, SC5D, SCD, ELOVL6\n- **Neurotransmitter reuptake**: SLC1A2 (EAAT2), SLC1A3 (EAAT1), SLC6A1, SLC6A11 (GABA transporters)\n\n<keyFinding priority='1'>Astrocytic SNAP-a is a distinct, transcriptionally defined state marked by high expression of synaptic adhesion and cholesterol biosynthesis genes, tightly coupled to neuronal synaptic gene expression, and independently reduced in both schizophrenia and aging.</keyFinding>\n<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nThe SNAP-a program is not a discrete, reactive astrocyte state but rather a continuous, graded axis of variation across individual astrocytes and donors.

Open questions include the mechanistic basis of neuron–astrocyte SNAP coupling, the causal directionality of SNAP decline, and whether SNAP-a can be modulated to restore synaptic function. The strong genetic enrichment for schizophrenia risk within SNAP-a genes suggests that astrocyte dysfunction is not merely reactive but may be a primary driver of disease.

Neuronal and glial nuclei were separated by FACS (NeuN+ and NeuN-), and cell types were annotated using the Allen Institute human brain atlas as a reference. The dataset comprised 89,325 nuclei.

Key upregulated genes included GFAP, CHI3L1 (YKL-40), and GJA1 (connexin43), all established markers of astrocyte reactivity and stress (<keyFinding priority='1'>Astrocytes upregulate GFAP, CHI3L1, and GJA1, indicating a reactive state in monogenic AD.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>). Additionally, there was increased expression of molecular chaperones (e.g., HSPB1), metallothioneins (e.g., MT1E, MT1G), and lysosomal genes (e.g., LAMP1, LAMP2), suggesting a broad cellular stress response and enhanced lysosomal activity (<keyFinding priority='1'>Upregulation of chaperones, metallothioneins, and lysosomal genes in astrocytes reflects cellular stress and altered proteostasis.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n\nFunctional enrichment analysis highlighted pathways related to stress response (GO:0006950), lysosome (GO:0005764), chaperone-mediated protein folding (GO:0061077), and glutamatergic synapse (GO:0098978). These changes suggest that astrocytes in AD are responding to chronic injury and altered neuronal-glial signaling.\n\nAstrocyte subtypes or states were not explicitly subdivided into multiple molecularly distinct populations within this study. Instead, the authors characterized the overall astrocyte population as exhibiting a disease-specific activation state. This state was compared to astrocyte responses in acute injury (intracerebral hemorrhage, ICH), revealing that AD astrocytes cluster separately from both controls and ICH in t-SNE space (<keyFinding priority='2'>Astrocyte activation in AD is molecularly distinct from acute activation seen in ICH.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>). While some genes associated with pan-reactive, A1 (neurotoxic), and A2 (neuroprotective) astrocyte states (as defined in mouse models) were upregulated in AD astrocytes, the overall expression of these signatures was less pronounced than in ICH, indicating a unique, disease-specific phenotype (<keyFinding priority='2'>AD astrocytes partially express pan-reactive, A1, and A2 markers, but to a lesser degree than in acute injury, supporting a distinct chronic activation state.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n\nNo evidence was presented for astrocyte proliferation or major morphological changes; the study focused on transcriptional activation. There was no explicit identification of homeostatic versus disease-associated astrocyte subtypes, but the data suggest a shift of the entire astrocyte population toward an activated, stress-responsive state in AD.\n\nCell-cell communication analysis showed increased potential signaling between neurons and astrocytes in AD, despite an overall reduction in neuron-neuron interactions. Notably, neuron-astrocyte signaling via neuregulins (NRG1/2/3 and EGFR) was decreased due to downregulation of both ligands in neurons and receptors (EGFR) in astrocytes (<keyFinding priority='2'>Neuron-astrocyte neuregulin signaling is compromised in AD, potentially affecting astrocyte support functions.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n\nThe study did not report direct associations between astrocyte activation and specific genetic risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype) within the AD cohort, nor did it identify astrocyte subtypes linked to particular clinical or pathological features. The activation phenotype was consistent across both PSEN1 and APP mutation carriers.\n\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> for all major findings, as the authors did not explicitly discuss conflicts with prior astrocyte classification schemes, but rather emphasized the distinctiveness of the AD activation state compared to acute injury and mouse models.\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nAstrocyte activation in monogenic AD is characterized by a unique, chronic stress response that is distinct from acute inflammatory or injury-induced states. This phenotype may contribute to both adaptive and maladaptive processes in disease progression, including altered support for neurons, modulation of synaptic and metabolic homeostasis, and participation in neuroinflammatory signaling. The upregulation of GFAP, CHI3L1, and GJA1 in astrocytes may serve as potential biomarkers of disease-specific astrocyte activation. However, the functional consequences—whether protective, detrimental, or both—remain to be fully elucidated. The findings suggest that targeting astrocyte stress responses or modulating their activation state could be a therapeutic avenue, but further mechanistic studies are needed.\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications**\n\nThis study provides a detailed transcriptional profile of astrocyte activation in monogenic AD, revealing a disease-specific, chronic reactive state that is distinct from both homeostatic and acutely reactive (e.g., ICH-induced) astrocytes. The upregulation of canonical reactive markers (GFAP, CHI3L1, GJA1) and stress response genes aligns partially with previously described pan-reactive, A1, and A2 states from mouse models, but the overall signature is unique to the AD context. The lack of clear molecular subdivision into multiple astrocyte subtypes suggests that, in this disease stage and brain region, astrocyte activation is a population-wide phenomenon rather than restricted to a discrete subset.\n\nOpen questions include whether more granular astrocyte subtypes might be resolved with larger sample sizes or different brain regions, how these transcriptional changes relate to functional and morphological alterations, and whether similar activation states are present in sporadic AD or other neurodegenerative conditions. The study does not address the temporal evolution of astrocyte activation or its causal role in neurodegeneration. Future work should integrate spatial transcriptomics, functional assays, and genetic stratification to dissect the heterogeneity and impact of astrocyte responses in AD.\n\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> The authors do not report explicit conflicts with prior astrocyte classification schemes, but highlight the distinctiveness of the AD-specific activation state compared to acute injury and mouse models."

In contrast, Astrocytes3, Astrocytes4, and Astrocytes5 were over-represented in PD and displayed reactive, stress-response, and synaptic maintenance signatures. APOE and oxidative stress markers were upregulated in PD-enriched subtypes, with spatial transcriptomics confirming astrocytic TH expression. These findings suggest astrocyte heterogeneity and subtype-specific vulnerability modulated by dopamine metabolism and stress pathways in PD.\n\n---\n\n**Detailed Summary (≈800–1000 words):**\n\n<findings>\nAstrocyte Heterogeneity and Subtype Characterization in SNpc\n\nMartirosyan et al. performed a comprehensive snRNA-seq analysis of the human SNpc, identifying six distinct astrocyte subpopulations (Astrocytes0–Astrocytes5) with unique marker gene profiles, functional signatures, and disease associations. Astrocytes comprised approximately 25% of all nuclei, and their subtypes were present in both control and PD samples, though with marked shifts in abundance in disease.\n\n**Astrocytes2 (TH-enriched, PD-depleted):**\nThis subpopulation was significantly depleted in PD samples (<keyFinding priority='1'>Astrocytes2 is a TH-enriched astrocyte subtype, marked by high expression of SLC6A3, SNCA, and TH, and is significantly reduced in PD</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>). Marker gene analysis revealed enrichment for dopamine metabolism genes (SLC6A3, SNCA, TH), suggesting a unique astrocytic population with dopaminergic features. Pathway analysis indicated involvement in dopamine metabolism, vesicle trafficking, protein folding (HSP90AA1, HSP90AB1, HSPA8), and apoptosis (JUN, FOS). The depletion of this subtype in PD mirrors the loss of TH-enriched neurons and microglia, suggesting shared vulnerability mechanisms, possibly linked to dopamine handling and oxidative stress. Spatial transcriptomics confirmed TH expression in astrocytes, though at lower levels than neurons.\n\n**Astrocytes3 (PD-enriched, reactive/stress response):**\nAstrocytes3 was predominantly found in PD patients (<keyFinding priority='2'>Astrocytes3 is over-represented in PD and exhibits a reactive/stress-response signature</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>). This subtype was enriched for genes involved in fatty acid metabolism (PTGES3, ABHD3, ADIPOR2, ABHD2) and the unfolded protein response (BAG3, SERPINH1, DNAJB1, HSPB1), consistent with a reactive astrocyte phenotype. Differential gene expression analysis showed upregulation of ubiquitin ligase complex genes (ANAPC16, KLHL24) and downregulation of serine-threonine signaling genes (PPP2R2B, SPRED1) in PD, suggesting activation of protein quality control and stress pathways.\n\n**Astrocytes4 (PD-enriched, oxidative stress/immune response):**\nAstrocytes4 was also enriched in PD and characterized by high expression of metallothionein genes (MT2A, MT1E, MT3), GFAP (a canonical marker of astrogliosis), and APOE (<keyFinding priority='2'>Astrocytes4 is a PD-enriched subtype with high APOE, GFAP, and metallothionein expression, indicating oxidative stress and immune activation</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>). Pathway analysis highlighted mitochondrial changes, oxidative stress, and immune response. Differential expression in PD included upregulation of genes related to T cell activity, lipid metabolism, and ion transport, supporting a role in neuroinflammation and metabolic stress.\n\n**Astrocytes5 (PD-enriched, synaptic maintenance):**\nAstrocytes5 was over-represented in PD and displayed a gene signature associated with axon development, axon ensheathment, and synapse organization, suggesting a role in neuronal maintenance and survival. In PD, this subtype showed downregulation of CYP7B1 (lipid homeostasis) and upregulation of PTOV1 (cell proliferation), indicating altered support functions in disease.\n\n**Astrocytes1 (reactive, C3/CD44+):**\nAstrocytes1, enriched for reactive astrocyte markers C3 and CD44, likely represents another reactive state. Genes involved in glutamate metabolism and synapse assembly were also highly expressed. In PD, this subtype showed dysregulation of TNF-mediated signaling (CCDC3, NOL3), implicating inflammatory pathways.\n\n**Astrocytes0 (baseline/homeostatic):**\nAstrocytes0 did not show significant disease association and was characterized by calcium transport and cholesterol metabolism pathways, likely representing a homeostatic population.\n\n**Cell Type Proportions and Disease Modulation:**\nAstrocytes1, 3, 4, and 5 were significantly over-represented in PD, while Astrocytes2 was depleted (<keyFinding priority='1'>PD is associated with a shift from TH-enriched (Astrocytes2) to reactive/stress-response (Astrocytes3/4/5) astrocyte states</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>). These changes were validated by spatial transcriptomics and meta-analysis of independent datasets.\n\n**Pathway Enrichment and Functional Implications:**\nPD-enriched astrocyte subtypes showed upregulation of genes involved in the unfolded protein response, oxidative stress, immune activation, and synaptic support. The TH-enriched Astrocytes2, depleted in PD, was uniquely associated with dopamine metabolism and protein folding pathways, suggesting a specialized role in dopaminergic signaling and vulnerability to PD pathology.\n\n**Genetic and Multi-omic Integration:**\nAstrocyte subtypes showed enrichment for genes associated with PD risk loci (e.g., SNCA in Astrocytes2/5), though no single subtype was overwhelmingly associated with GWAS hits. The depletion of TH-enriched astrocytes in PD was paralleled by similar losses in TH-enriched microglia and oligodendrocytes, suggesting a convergent vulnerability across glial lineages.\n\n**Spatial and Morphological Validation:**\nSpatial transcriptomics confirmed the presence of TH transcripts in astrocytes, supporting the existence of this rare, vulnerable subtype in situ. The proportion of TH+ astrocytes was lower than in neurons but detectable, and their loss in PD was robust across both snRNA-seq and spatial data.\n\n**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**\nThe study suggests a trajectory from homeostatic/TH-enriched astrocytes toward reactive and stress-response states in PD, with loss of dopaminergic features and gain of immune/metabolic stress signatures.\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nAstrocyte subtypes in SNpc display marked heterogeneity in PD, with the TH-enriched Astrocytes2 subtype being selectively vulnerable and depleted, potentially contributing to the loss of dopaminergic support and exacerbation of neuronal degeneration. The expansion of reactive and stress-response astrocyte states (Astrocytes3/4/5) in PD may further drive neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, and synaptic dysfunction. The identification of APOE- and GFAP-high astrocyte subtypes aligns with known risk factors and pathological features of PD.

The identification of a TH-enriched astrocyte population (Astrocytes2) that is selectively depleted in PD, alongside similar losses in TH-enriched microglia and oligodendrocytes, suggests a convergent vulnerability of dopamine-handling glia in disease. The expansion of reactive, stress-response, and synaptic maintenance astrocyte states in PD underscores the dynamic, context-dependent roles of astrocytes in neurodegeneration. Open questions include the precise functional contributions of each subtype to PD progression, the mechanisms underlying selective vulnerability, and the potential for targeting astrocyte states therapeutically. The study’s findings are consistent with emerging models of glial diversity in neurodegeneration, though the existence and function of TH+ astrocytes in vivo remain to be fully validated. No explicit contradictions with prior classification schemes are discussed, but the work extends previous models by highlighting dopaminergic features in glia and their loss in PD.\n\n---\n\n**Tag summary for major findings:**\n- <keyFinding priority='1'>TH-enriched Astrocytes2 is depleted in PD</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n- <keyFinding priority='2'>PD-enriched astrocyte subtypes (Astrocytes3/4/5) show reactive, stress-response, and synaptic maintenance signatures</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium-high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n- <keyFinding priority='1'>Astrocyte state shifts in PD are validated by spatial transcriptomics and meta-analysis</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

Subclustering and differential expression analyses were performed, and findings were validated by RT-qPCR, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry.\n</methods>\n\n<findings>\n**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Identification**\n\nAstrocytes comprised approximately 5% of all nuclei. Subclustering revealed four astrocyte subpopulations (Ast0–Ast3), with Ast1 specifically enriched in AD-pathology samples. The Ast1 subpopulation was overrepresented in individuals with high amyloid, high Braak stage, and cognitive impairment, and was particularly enriched in female subjects with AD pathology (<keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n\n**Astrocyte Subtype Characterization**\n\n- **Ast1 (AD-associated astrocytes):**\n  - **Defining markers:** Upregulation of **GLUL** (glutamine synthetase) and **CLU** (clusterin), the latter being an AD GWAS risk gene. Additional markers include genes involved in protein folding and stress response (e.g., HSP90AA1, HSPB1, CRYAB).\n  - **Functional signature:** Enriched for pathways related to protein folding, molecular chaperones, autophagy, and apoptosis, indicating a reactive, stress-responsive phenotype. Gene ontology analysis highlighted proteostasis and unfolded protein response.\n  - **Disease association:** Strongly overrepresented in AD-pathology individuals, especially those with high amyloid and tau burden and cognitive decline. Quantitative enrichment was robust to randomization and not driven by outlier individuals.\n  - **Sex bias:** Ast1 astrocytes were significantly more frequent in females with AD pathology (<keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n  - **Spatial/morphological validation:** Not directly shown for astrocytes, but subpopulation-specific markers were validated at the transcript level.\n\n- **Ast0 (putative homeostatic astrocytes):**\n  - **Defining markers:** Lower expression of stress response genes; relatively higher in canonical astrocyte markers (AQP4, GFAP).\n  - **Functional signature:** Likely represents a baseline, non-reactive state.\n  - **Disease association:** Enriched in no-pathology individuals, especially males.\n\n- **Ast2 and Ast3:** These subpopulations were less well characterized, with no strong disease or trait associations reported.\n\n**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**\n\nAstrocytes in AD pathology showed a predominance of upregulated genes (53–63% of DEGs), in contrast to neurons, which were mostly downregulated. Key upregulated genes in AD astrocytes included **CLU**, **GLUL**, and heat shock proteins. Pathways involved in protein folding, autophagy, and apoptosis were significantly enriched in late-stage AD, suggesting a global stress response. Notably, **APOE** was downregulated in astrocytes but upregulated in microglia, highlighting cell-type-specific regulation (<keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n\n**Disease Progression and Trajectories**\n\nMajor transcriptional changes in astrocytes appeared early in AD progression (amyloid-positive, mild tau), with further upregulation of stress response genes in late-stage disease. However, the most pronounced cell-type-specific changes were observed at early stages, while late-stage upregulation of proteostasis genes was shared across multiple cell types.\n\n**Sex Differences**\n\nAst1 (AD-associated) astrocytes were overrepresented in females, and gene–trait correlation analysis showed that female astrocytes had a stronger transcriptional response to pathology. This was not explained by more severe pathology in females, but rather by a sex-specific propensity to adopt the reactive state. This finding was robust across multiple analyses and not driven by individual outliers (<keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n\n**Genetic and Multi-omic Integration**\n\nCLU, a marker of Ast1, is an established AD risk gene. The study’s gene–trait correlation modules linked astrocyte stress response genes to AD GWAS loci, supporting a genetic contribution to the observed transcriptional states.\n\n**Cell-Cell Communication and Regulatory Networks**\n\nWhile not the main focus, the upregulation of clusterin (CLU) and other chaperones in astrocytes suggests altered astrocyte–neuron and astrocyte–microglia signaling in AD.\n\n**Morphological/Spatial Validation**\n\nNo direct spatial or morphological validation of astrocyte subtypes was reported, but transcript-level validation was performed for key markers.\n\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nAstrocytes in AD show a shift toward a reactive, stress-responsive phenotype marked by upregulation of CLU and protein folding genes. This state is strongly associated with AD pathology and is more prevalent in females, suggesting a sex-specific vulnerability or response. The findings imply that astrocyte dysfunction and stress responses may contribute to disease progression, and that CLU+ reactive astrocytes could serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets. However, causality cannot be established from these cross-sectional data.\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**\n\nThis study provides a high-confidence, cell-type-resolved map of astrocyte heterogeneity in human AD, identifying a disease-associated, CLU+ reactive astrocyte state (Ast1) that is enriched in females and linked to AD risk genetics. The alignment of CLU and stress response gene upregulation with known AD GWAS loci supports the relevance of these subtypes to human disease. However, the lack of spatial or morphological validation for astrocyte subtypes, and the cross-sectional nature of the data, leave open questions about the functional consequences and temporal dynamics of these states. Future work should address whether Ast1 astrocytes are neuroprotective or pathogenic, their interactions with other glial and neuronal populations, and whether similar subtypes are observed in other brain regions or in longitudinal progression. The pronounced sex differences highlight the need for sex-stratified analyses in future studies and may inform personalized therapeutic strategies.

Mouse 5xFAD amyloid model brains were also profiled at multiple ages for cross-species comparison. Integration with prior snRNA-seq datasets and spatial proteomics (IMC) was performed.  \n</methods>\n\n<findings>\n**Cell Type Proportions:**  \nAstrocytes (ASC) showed widespread shifts in abundance across disease states, with both depletion and expansion of specific subpopulations depending on cortical region and disease stage. Differential abundance was especially pronounced in upper cortical layers and white matter (WM) in both sporadic AD and DSAD.\n\n**Differential Gene Expression:**  \nAstrocytes in AD (both sporadic and DSAD) upregulated genes associated with inflammatory response, intermediate filament organization, and amyloid binding. Key upregulated markers included SERPINA3, VIM, CD44, CLU, and CST3. Downregulation of genes related to neurotransmission and synaptic support was observed in certain cortical layers.\n\n**Pathway Enrichment:**  \nAstrocyte DEGs were enriched for immune response, oxidative stress, amyloid-β binding, and NF-κB signaling. In females, astrocytic DEGs were further enriched for glucose metabolism and inflammatory pathways.\n\n**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  \nAstrocytes were divided into at least four subtypes (ASC1–ASC4), each with distinct spatial and molecular signatures:\n- **ASC1:** Enriched in WM and lower cortical layers; upregulated GFAP, S100B, and CLU; associated with myelination and vascular interactions.\n- **ASC2:** Present in both GM and WM; upregulated VIM, CD44, and SERPINA3; marked by strong inflammatory and stress-response signatures; expanded in upper cortical layers in late-stage AD and DSAD.\n- **ASC3:** Localized to upper cortical layers; upregulated CD44, CLU, and CST3; associated with amyloid proximity and increased in DSAD; shows strong overlap with disease-associated astrocyte (DAA) signatures from mouse models.\n- **ASC4:** Less abundant; upregulated ERBIN and APOE; associated with phagocytic and lipid metabolism pathways.\n\n**Spatial and Morphological Validation:**  \nSpatial transcriptomics revealed that astrocyte inflammatory modules (notably meta-module M11, containing SERPINA3, VIM, CD44, CLU, CST3) were upregulated in upper cortical layers, especially in regions with high amyloid burden. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) confirmed increased protein levels of CLU, CD44, and CST3 in astrocytes near amyloid plaques and in DSAD.\n\n**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  \nAstrocyte inflammatory signatures (M11) increased with disease progression and amyloid accumulation in both human and 5xFAD mouse cortex. M11 expression correlated with AD genetic risk scores and was preserved across species, though with some divergence in module composition.\n\n**Sex Differences:**  \nFemale DSAD cases showed stronger upregulation of inflammatory astrocyte genes (e.g., C1QB, SERPINA3, VIM, CD44) compared to males, particularly in WM and upper cortical layers. This was validated at the protein level (C1QB immunofluorescence).\n\n**Gene Regulatory Networks:**  \nAstrocyte modules were enriched for hub genes implicated in AD GWAS (CLU, CD44, CST3, ADAMTS1). M11 module expression was tightly linked to AD risk loci.\n\n**Cell-Cell Communication:**  \nAstrocyte-mediated ANGPTL4 signaling was upregulated in DSAD, especially in upper cortical layers, and confirmed by immunofluorescence. CD99 signaling (also astrocyte-enriched) was downregulated in DSAD.\n\n**Spatial Analysis:**  \nAstrocyte inflammatory modules and marker genes were spatially concentrated in upper cortical layers and amyloid plaque hotspots. Amyloid-associated gene signatures in astrocytes overlapped with M11 hub genes.\n\n**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  \nAstrocyte modules (especially M11) were enriched for AD GWAS risk genes and showed strong correlation with polygenic risk scores in both human and mouse datasets.\n\n<keyFinding priority='1'>Astrocyte inflammatory module M11 (SERPINA3, VIM, CD44, CLU, CST3) is upregulated in upper cortical layers in both sporadic AD and DSAD, correlates with amyloid pathology, and is enriched for AD genetic risk loci.</keyFinding>\n<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n<keyFinding priority='1'>Distinct astrocyte subtypes (ASC2/ASC3) with strong inflammatory and amyloid-proximal signatures are expanded in DSAD and late-stage AD, validated by spatial transcriptomics and proteomics.</keyFinding>\n<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n<keyFinding priority='2'>Sex differences: Female DSAD brains show greater astrocyte inflammatory activation (C1QB, SERPINA3, VIM, CD44) than males, especially in WM and upper layers.</keyFinding>\n<confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n<keyFinding priority='2'>Astrocyte-mediated ANGPTL4 signaling is upregulated in DSAD, suggesting altered astrocyte-vascular and astrocyte-neuron communication.</keyFinding>\n<confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n<keyFinding priority='3'>Astrocyte modules are moderately preserved between human and mouse, with some divergence in module composition and spatial patterning.</keyFinding>\n<confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nAstrocyte inflammatory subtypes (notably those expressing SERPINA3, VIM, CD44, CLU, CST3) are strongly associated with amyloid pathology and AD genetic risk, suggesting they may contribute to neuroinflammation and synaptic dysfunction in both sporadic and genetic (DSAD) forms of AD.

A key astrocyte module (M11: SERPINA3, VIM, CD44, CLU, CST3) is upregulated near amyloid plaques and enriched for AD genetic risk loci. Inflammatory astrocyte subtypes (ASC2/ASC3) expand in DSAD and late-stage AD, with stronger activation in females. Astrocyte-mediated ANGPTL4 signaling is also increased in DSAD. These findings are validated by spatial transcriptomics and proteomics, and highlight astrocyte heterogeneity as a central feature of AD pathogenesis.\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications (≈150 words):**  \nThis work establishes a robust link between astrocyte inflammatory subtypes, amyloid pathology, and AD genetic risk in both sporadic and DSAD brains, with strong spatial and molecular validation. The identification of conserved astrocyte modules (notably M11) across human and mouse, and their enrichment for GWAS risk genes, supports their relevance as disease drivers or biomarkers. The expansion of amyloid-proximal, inflammatory astrocyte states (ASC2/ASC3) in DSAD and late-stage AD suggests a shared glial response across genetic and sporadic forms, but also highlights disease- and sex-specific nuances. The upregulation of astrocyte-derived signaling molecules (ANGPTL4, CD99) opens avenues for targeting glial-vascular and glial-neuronal interactions. Open questions remain regarding the causal role of these astrocyte states in neurodegeneration, their temporal dynamics, and their potential as therapeutic targets.

The lack of detailed pathway analysis or spatial validation for astrocytes leaves open questions about the specific functional consequences of these changes. Future work should address whether these astrocyte subtypes correspond to known reactive or homeostatic states, and whether their loss contributes causally to depressive pathology.

Notably, these included genes involved in cytoskeletal regulation and stress response pathways, such as HSP90AA1 (encoding HSP90α, a co-chaperone for steroid hormone receptors and stress response), FKBP4, and ACTB (β-actin).

There is no mention of astrocyte marker genes (e.g., GFAP, AQP4, SLC1A2) or disease-associated astrocyte signatures (e.g., A1/A2, reactive, homeostatic) in the results.\n\n**Spatial and Morphological Validation**\nThe only reference to glial cells with tau aggregates is in the context of PSP, where FACS plots and images show MAP2-negative/AT8-positive populations, which include oligodendrocytes and potentially astrocytes.

The main focus and all major findings pertain to neuronal populations.\n\n---\n\n**Detailed Summary**\n\n<keyFinding priority='3'>\nAstrocytes are included in the single-cell dataset generated by Otero-Garcia et al., but the study does not present any detailed analysis or findings regarding astrocyte subtypes, marker genes, or disease-associated states in Alzheimer’s disease or in relation to neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology.\n</keyFinding>\n<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nThe primary aim of the study was to resolve the molecular signatures underlying neuronal susceptibility to NFT formation in AD. The authors developed a FACS-based approach to isolate and profile single somas with and without NFTs from the human prefrontal cortex. While the method is capable of isolating glial cells (including astrocytes) with tau aggregates—as demonstrated in PSP tissue—astrocytes are not analyzed in detail in the context of AD.\n\nIn the main results, the authors focus on the identification and characterization of 20 neuronal subtypes, their vulnerability to NFT formation, and their transcriptional responses. The clustering and annotation of single-cell transcriptomes primarily distinguish excitatory and inhibitory neuronal subtypes, with glial cells (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia) only briefly mentioned as part of the overall cell population. There is no breakdown of astrocyte subtypes, nor are there data on changes in astrocyte proportions, gene expression, or functional states in AD or NFT-bearing tissue.\n\nThe study does not report any astrocyte-specific marker genes, nor does it discuss homeostatic versus reactive astrocyte states, disease-associated astrocyte (DAA) signatures, or any functional implications for astrocytes in AD. No pathway enrichment, gene regulatory network, or cell-cell communication analyses are performed for astrocytes. The spatial and morphological validation experiments are restricted to neuronal markers and NFT-bearing neurons.\n\nThe only mention of glial tau pathology is in the context of PSP, where the FACS method is shown to isolate MAP2-negative/AT8-positive glial cells, including oligodendrocytes with tau aggregates. However, in AD tissue, such glial populations are not further analyzed, and there is no evidence presented for astrocyte tau pathology or its molecular correlates.\n\nThe study does not address astrocyte dynamics across disease stages, nor does it analyze the impact of genetic or demographic factors on astrocyte states. All analyses of disease progression, gene regulatory networks, and multi-omic integration are restricted to neuronal populations.\n\nIn summary, while astrocytes are present in the dataset and the method could be adapted to study glial tau pathology, this paper does not provide any significant findings or insights regarding astrocyte heterogeneity, disease mechanisms, or clinical relevance in Alzheimer’s disease.\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications**\n\nThe absence of astrocyte-specific findings in this comprehensive single-cell study of AD cortex highlights a gap in the current understanding of astrocyte heterogeneity and their roles in NFT pathology. Although the FACS-based method is capable of isolating glial cells with tau aggregates, the lack of analysis for astrocytes in AD suggests that future studies should leverage this approach to systematically characterize astrocyte subtypes, marker genes, and disease-associated states in relation to tau pathology. This would be particularly relevant given the growing recognition of astrocyte contributions to neurodegeneration and neuroinflammation in AD. The study does not report any conflicts or contradictions with prior astrocyte literature, as astrocytes are not analyzed in detail.\n\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

The findings do not conflict with prior models, but rather underscore the need for astrocyte-focused protocols (e.g., single-nucleus RNA-seq, astrocyte-specific sorting) to resolve astrocyte diversity and their roles in AD.

This transition is marked by upregulation of inflammatory and stress-response genes, including NEAT1, and is associated with increased FOSL2 and decreased CTCF activity. These findings, derived from integrated snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq of human prefrontal cortex, reveal a conserved disease-associated astrocyte trajectory in AD.\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications (≈150 words):**\nThis study provides a high-confidence, multi-omic map of astrocyte heterogeneity in human AD, confirming and extending the concept of disease-associated astrocytes (DAAs) previously described in mouse models. The identification of distinct reactive (GFAP^high/CHI3L1^+) and homeostatic (GFAP^low/WIF1^+/ADAMTS17^+) astrocyte subtypes, and the demonstration of a trajectory from homeostatic to reactive states, suggest that targeting astrocyte state transitions may be therapeutically relevant. The upregulation of NEAT1 and the involvement of FOSL2 and CTCF in astrocyte state regulation provide new candidate biomarkers and mechanistic targets. Notably, the study finds no major contradictions with prior mouse or human data, instead reinforcing the conservation of DAA signatures. Open questions include the functional consequences of these astrocyte state shifts for neuronal health and cognition, and whether genetic risk factors modulate astrocyte trajectories in AD. Future work should address spatial localization, causal mechanisms, and therapeutic modulation of astrocyte states.\n\n---\n\n**End of summary.**"

The cohort included 12 males with schizophrenia and 14 male controls. The analysis focused on transcriptomic profiling to resolve cell-type-specific gene expression changes, with clustering to identify 20 distinct cell populations, including astrocytes. Downstream analyses included differential gene expression, pathway enrichment, and identification of cell-type-specific regulatory factors.\n</methods>\n\n<findings>\nThe principal finding of this study is that schizophrenia-associated transcriptomic changes in the DLPFC are overwhelmingly concentrated in neuronal subtypes, with astrocytes showing minimal involvement. Of the 4,766 differential expression events identified across 2,994 unique genes, approximately 96% were localized to five neuronal cell types.

The clustering analysis resolved astrocytes as a transcriptomically distinct population, but there is no mention of further astrocyte sub-clustering or the emergence of reactive, inflammatory, or otherwise disease-associated astrocyte states in schizophrenia. The absence of such findings suggests that, within the resolution and sample size of this dataset, astrocytes in the DLPFC do not exhibit major transcriptional reprogramming or expansion of disease-associated subpopulations in schizophrenia. <keyFinding priority='1'>Astrocytes in schizophrenia DLPFC show minimal differential gene expression and no evidence for disease-associated subtypes, in contrast to neurons.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nThe study does not report significant changes in the proportion of astrocytes between schizophrenia and control samples.

This implies that astrocyte dysfunction, at least at the transcriptomic level in this brain region and cohort, is unlikely to be a primary driver of schizophrenia pathology. The lack of astrocyte involvement may limit the utility of astrocyte-derived biomarkers or therapeutic targets in this context, though this does not preclude astrocyte contributions in other brain regions or disease stages.\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications**\n\nThe minimal transcriptomic changes observed in astrocytes in this study raise important questions about the cell-type specificity of schizophrenia pathology in the DLPFC. Future research should address whether astrocyte involvement is more pronounced in other cortical or subcortical regions, at different disease stages, or in response to environmental or genetic modifiers not captured in this cohort. The absence of disease-associated astrocyte subtypes contrasts with findings in other neurological disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease, where reactive astrocyte states are prominent), suggesting possible disease- or region-specific roles for astrocytes. It remains to be determined whether more subtle astrocyte functional changes, undetectable at the transcriptomic level, contribute to schizophrenia, or whether post-transcriptional, metabolic, or spatial alterations play a role. The study’s findings align with a growing body of evidence emphasizing neuronal dysfunction in schizophrenia, but further work is needed to fully exclude astrocyte contributions, especially using larger cohorts, multi-omic approaches, and spatially resolved transcriptomics. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

However, the lack of a strong, uniform reactive or disease-associated astrocyte signature in cortex (contrasting with spinal cord) suggests that astrocyte-mediated neurotoxicity may be less prominent or more heterogeneous in these regions. These findings imply that astrocyte dysfunction in ALS/FTLD cortex is characterized more by loss of support than by overt inflammatory activation, and that therapeutic strategies targeting astrocyte reactivity may need to be tailored by region and disease stage. <keyFinding priority='2'>Astrocyte dysfunction in ALS/FTLD cortex is primarily associated with impaired homeostatic/metabolic support rather than classical reactivity.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**\nAstrocytes in ALS and FTLD cortices show downregulation of homeostatic genes (notably SLC1A2) and upregulation of zinc transporters, with increased metabolic activity especially in ALS. However, canonical reactive or disease-associated astrocyte signatures (A1/A2/DAA) are not broadly induced in cortex, in contrast to prior spinal cord studies. These transcriptional changes are highly convergent across sporadic and C9orf72+ cases, and are not strongly modulated by genotype or region.\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications (≈150 words):**\nThis study challenges the generalizability of spinal cord-derived astrocyte reactivity models to the human cortex in ALS and FTLD. The absence of strong A1/A2 or DAA signatures in cortical astrocytes, despite clear homeostatic impairment, suggests that astrocyte-driven neurotoxicity may be regionally restricted or context-dependent. Open questions include whether subtle or transient reactive states are missed by snRNA-seq, whether astrocyte dysfunction is primarily loss-of-function in cortex, and how these changes interact with neuronal vulnerability. The lack of GWAS risk gene enrichment in astrocytes further supports a non-primary role in disease initiation, though their altered support functions may still contribute to disease progression. Future work should integrate spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, and functional assays to resolve astrocyte heterogeneity and clarify their role in cortical pathology. The findings also highlight the need for region- and stage-specific therapeutic approaches targeting astrocyte biology in ALS/FTLD.\n\n---\n\n**Tag summary for major findings:**\n- <keyFinding priority='2'>ALS/FTLD cortical astrocytes show impaired homeostatic/metabolic support, not classical reactivity.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>\n- <keyFinding priority='2'>No broad induction of A1/A2/DAA signatures in cortex, in contrast to spinal cord.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>\n- <keyFinding priority='2'>Transcriptional changes are highly convergent across sporadic and C9orf72+ cases.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

A novel SNP-based transcriptotyping method was used to distinguish wild-type and mutant nuclei within the same individual, enabling direct cell-autonomous comparisons.

However, the primary focus of the study was on neuronal populations, particularly excitatory neurons and VIP interneurons, where MECP2-dependent gene expression changes were most pronounced.\n\nFor astrocytes, the following key points were reported:\n\n- **Cell Type Proportions:**  \n  The proportion of astrocytes among total nuclei was not significantly altered between MECP2-mutant and wild-type transcriptotypes in either mouse or human Rett syndrome samples. No evidence for selective vulnerability or expansion of astrocyte populations was presented. <keyFinding priority='3'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n- **Differential Gene Expression:**  \n  The study did not identify a substantial number of differentially expressed genes between MECP2-mutant and wild-type astrocytes.

It remains possible that astrocyte dysfunction in Rett syndrome is subtle, region-specific, or mediated by post-transcriptional, metabolic, or non-cell-autonomous mechanisms not captured by this approach. Future studies could employ higher-resolution spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, or functional assays to probe astrocyte contributions to Rett pathology, particularly during development or in other brain regions. The findings align with prior models suggesting a dominant neuronal-autonomous mechanism for MECP2-related dysfunction, but do not exclude more nuanced astrocyte roles.

Over 590,000 high-quality nuclei were analyzed after stringent QC. Cell type annotation and subclustering were performed using reference-based mapping and hierarchical marker gene analysis. Validation included bulk RNA-seq deconvolution, snATAC-seq for chromatin accessibility, and immunohistochemistry.\n</methods>\n\n<findings>\n**Cell Type Proportions and General Trends**\nAstrocytes (ASTs) were systematically profiled across all regions and disorders. The most striking disease-specific compositional change was a significant depletion of astrocytes in the visual cortex (V1) of PSP cases (<keyFinding priority='1'>PSP V1 astrocyte depletion</keyFinding>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>). This depletion was validated by stringent cell filtering, reference-based mapping, and bulk RNA-seq deconvolution (Bisque, CIBERSORT), and was not observed in AD or bvFTD.\n\n**Astrocyte Subtypes and States**\nAstrocytes were divided into canonical protoplasmic and fibrous subtypes, with further subclustering revealing distinct states:\n\n- **Homeostatic Protoplasmic Astrocytes (AST-1):**  \n  Depleted across all disorders and regions, including INS_AST-1, BA4_AST-1, and V1_AST-1. These subtypes expressed high levels of SLC1A3 and other homeostatic markers. Their loss was most pronounced in disease samples, suggesting a general vulnerability of homeostatic astrocytes to neurodegeneration (<keyFinding priority='2'>Shared depletion of homeostatic astrocytes</keyFinding>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n\n- **Disease-Enriched Astrocytes (AST-0):**  \n  A related astrocyte state (INS_AST-0) was enriched in the insula across all disorders, expressing regulators of hypoxic response and correlating with tau pathology in PSP. This subtype upregulated genes involved in hypoxia and stress response, and its abundance correlated with higher tau scores in PSP (<keyFinding priority='2'>Disease-enriched, hypoxia-responsive astrocytes</keyFinding>, <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n\n- **PSP-Specific Astrocyte Changes:**  \n  In PSP V1, astrocytes showed not only depletion but also a unique transcriptional and epigenetic profile. Differential gene expression revealed downregulation of REST (a repressor of neuronal genes) and upregulation of ASCL1 (a neuronal fate determinant), along with increased expression of neuronally enriched genes (ATP2B3, ILDR2, ELOVL4, PCMT1, NSF, CUX2). This suggests a relaxation of astrocyte identity and possible aberrant neuronal gene expression (<keyFinding priority='1'>PSP V1 astrocytes lose REST and upregulate neuronal genes</keyFinding>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n\n  Chromatin accessibility (snATAC-seq) confirmed increased accessibility at regions normally hypermethylated (silenced) in astrocytes, especially in cluster C22, which is depleted in PSP and marked by high REST promoter activity in controls. This supports a model of epigenetic erosion of astrocyte identity in PSP (<keyFinding priority='1'>Epigenetic relaxation in PSP astrocytes</keyFinding>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n\n  Additionally, a PSP-enriched astrocyte cluster (V1_AST-3) upregulated neuronally enriched transcription factors (CUX1, CUX2, ZMAT4, FOXP1), with immunohistochemistry confirming CUX1 protein in astrocytes in PSP but not controls. This cluster also upregulated genes involved in protein homeostasis and Parkinson’s disease risk (e.g., PARK7, SNCA) (<keyFinding priority='1'>PSP astrocytes ectopically express neuronal TFs</keyFinding>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n\n- **Shared Disease-Associated Astrocyte States:**  \n  Across all disorders, there was a reproducible downregulation of SLC1A3 (a protoplasmic astrocyte marker) and upregulation of stress/hypoxia response genes. Some astrocyte subtypes (e.g., INS_AST-0) were enriched in disease and correlated with tau pathology, suggesting a general reactive phenotype.\n\n**Pathway Enrichment and Functional Implications**\n- Disease-enriched astrocytes upregulated hypoxia response, stress, and synapse phagocytosis pathways.\n- PSP-specific astrocytes showed loss of chromatin silencing at neuronally methylated regions, suggesting a breakdown of cell-type-specific gene regulation.\n- Shared astrocyte changes included upregulation of PIKFYVE (a drug target in ALS) in PSP and AD, and downregulation of homeostatic genes.\n\n**Modulators & Metrics**\n- The astrocyte depletion in PSP V1 was not explained by local tau pathology (which was minimal), suggesting a disease-specific mechanism.\n- Chromatin accessibility changes were most pronounced in PSP, with loss of heterochromatin at astrocyte-specific methylated sites.\n\n**Gene Regulatory Networks**\n- REST was specifically downregulated in PSP and bvFTD V1 astrocytes.\n- PSP V1 astrocytes uniquely activated neuronally enriched TF regulons (CUX1, CUX2, ZMAT4, FOXP1), as shown by SCENIC and validated by snATAC-seq footprinting.\n\n**Spatial/Morphological Validation**\n- Immunohistochemistry confirmed CUX1 protein in astrocytes in PSP V1, not in controls.\n- Bulk RNA-seq deconvolution confirmed astrocyte depletion in PSP across multiple regions.\n\n**Aging/Disease Trajectories**\n- No explicit pseudotime or trajectory modeling for astrocytes, but the data suggest a transition from homeostatic to reactive and then to aberrant/neuronal-like states in PSP.\n\n**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**\n- No direct astrocyte-specific GWAS enrichment reported, but chromatin and transcriptomic data support a cell-intrinsic mechanism in PSP.\n\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nAstrocyte pathology in PSP is characterized by both quantitative depletion and qualitative loss of cell identity, with aberrant expression of neuronal genes and transcription factors. This is distinct from the more general reactive astrocyte changes seen in AD and bvFTD. The findings suggest that astrocyte dysfunction in PSP may involve epigenetic erosion of cell identity, potentially contributing to disease-specific vulnerability and pathology. The upregulation of genes like PIKFYVE (a therapeutic target in ALS) and the loss of REST-mediated repression may offer new avenues for therapeutic intervention or biomarker development. However, causal relationships remain to be established, and the observed changes are strongly associated but not proven to drive disease.\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n**Quick Reference**\n\nAstrocytes in PSP show striking depletion in the visual cortex, accompanied by loss of homeostatic subtypes and emergence of aberrant astrocyte states that ectopically express neuronal genes and transcription factors (e.g., CUX1, CUX2), driven by downregulation of REST and epigenetic relaxation. These changes are PSP-specific and validated by chromatin accessibility and immunohistochemistry, suggesting a unique astrocyte-intrinsic mechanism in PSP.\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications**\n\nThis study provides strong evidence that astrocyte pathology in PSP is not merely reactive but involves a disease-specific breakdown of cell identity, with astrocytes acquiring neuronal-like features at both the transcriptomic and epigenetic levels. The loss of REST and gain of neuronal TF activity in astrocytes is a novel finding (<keyFinding priority='1'>), not previously described in other tauopathies, and may underlie the unique astrocytic tau pathology of PSP. The upregulation of PIKFYVE and other stress-response genes suggests potential therapeutic targets. The findings align with emerging models of glial plasticity and cell identity erosion in neurodegeneration, but the explicit link to tau pathology and disease progression in PSP requires further experimental validation. No explicit contradictions with prior data are discussed by the authors, but the specificity of astrocyte depletion and identity loss to PSP represents a departure from the more general reactive astrocyte changes described in AD and FTD.

    "summary": "1) **Quick Reference (≈100 words)**\n\nThis large-scale single-nucleus RNA-seq study of human prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia (Ruzicka et al., 2020, medRxiv) found that astrocytes exhibit relatively modest transcriptional changes compared to neurons. The most notable astrocyte finding is the broad upregulation of the molecular chaperone **CLU (clusterin)**, a gene also implicated by schizophrenia GWAS loci, and previously observed to be hypomethylated in schizophrenia. However, the study did not identify distinct disease-associated astrocyte subtypes or major shifts in astrocyte proportions. Astrocyte transcriptional changes were not strongly linked to genetic risk or major disease mechanisms, in contrast to neuronal populations.\n\n---\n\n2) **Detailed Summary (≈800–1000 words)**\n\n<metadata>\n- Ruzicka WB, Mohammadi S, Davila-Velderrain J, Subburaju S, Reed Tso D, Hourihan M, Kellis M. \"Single-cell dissection of schizophrenia reveals neurodevelopmental-synaptic axis and transcriptional resilience.\" medRxiv, 2020. doi:10.1101/2020.11.06.20225342\n- Disease focus: Schizophrenia\n</metadata>\n\n<methods>\nThis study performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on postmortem prefrontal cortex (Brodmann Area 10) from 24 schizophrenia and 24 control individuals, yielding over 500,000 high-quality nuclei. Cell types and states were annotated using the ACTIONet multiresolution archetypal analysis framework, and differential expression was assessed using a pseudo-bulk approach with linear modeling, controlling for demographic and technical covariates. Validation included in situ hybridization (RNAscope) and integration with GWAS and epigenomic data.\n</methods>\n\n<findings>\nAstrocytes were robustly identified as a major glial cell type in the prefrontal cortex, using canonical marker genes such as **SLC1A2**. However, in contrast to the extensive subtype and state heterogeneity observed in neuronal populations, the study did not report the identification of multiple distinct astrocyte subtypes or disease-associated astrocyte states. The astrocyte population appeared relatively homogeneous in the ACTIONet cell-state landscape, and no evidence was presented for the emergence of reactive or disease-specific astrocyte subpopulations in schizophrenia.\n\n**Cell Type Proportions:**  \nThe proportion of astrocytes did not show significant differences between schizophrenia and control groups. The study explicitly notes that glial cell types, including astrocytes, did not exhibit the consistent pan-transcriptomic pathology scores observed in neurons, suggesting a lesser degree of global transcriptional perturbation in astrocytes in schizophrenia.\n\n**Differential Gene Expression:**  \nThe most prominent astrocyte-specific transcriptional change was the **upregulation of CLU (clusterin)** in schizophrenia. CLU is a molecular chaperone and was found to be overexpressed not only in astrocytes but also across all excitatory neuron cell types and most inhibitory neuron cell types. This upregulation was confirmed by both snRNA-seq and in situ hybridization (RNAscope), with the highest expression in schizophrenia individuals, lower in controls, and lowest in \"transcriptionally resilient\" individuals (those with an abundance of the Ex-SZTR neuronal state and low global schizophrenia pathology scores). The directionality of CLU upregulation in astrocytes is consistent with prior findings of CLU hypomethylation in schizophrenia postmortem brain and overexpression in laser-capture-microdissected neurons.\n\nOther astrocyte marker genes or functional genes did not show strong or consistent differential expression in schizophrenia. The study does not report major downregulated genes or pathway-level changes specific to astrocytes.\n\n**Pathway Enrichment:**  \nNo significant pathway enrichment or functional signature was reported for astrocyte-specific differentially expressed genes. In contrast, neuronal populations showed strong enrichment for synaptic, neurodevelopmental, and plasticity pathways.\n\n**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  \nUnlike neurons, where multiple subtypes and disease-associated states (e.g., Ex-SZTR) were identified and characterized by distinct marker genes and functional signatures, astrocytes were treated as a single, relatively uniform population. No evidence for homeostatic versus reactive or disease-associated astrocyte subtypes was presented.\n\n**Modulators & Metrics:**  \nAstrocyte transcriptional changes were not strongly modulated by genetic risk factors, demographic variables, or clinical covariates. The upregulation of CLU in astrocytes was observed across schizophrenia cases, but the study did not link this change to specific genetic variants or environmental exposures.\n\n**Gene Regulatory Networks:**  \nCLU is located within a schizophrenia-associated GWAS locus, but the study did not identify astrocyte-specific transcriptional regulators or gene regulatory networks driving the observed changes. The major transcription factors implicated as master regulators of schizophrenia pathology (TCF4, MEF2C, SOX5, SATB2) were primarily associated with neuronal populations.\n\n**Cell-Cell Communication:**  \nNo specific ligand-receptor interactions or cell-cell communication pathways involving astrocytes were highlighted as altered in schizophrenia.\n\n**Spatial Analysis:**  \nThe study did not report spatial or morphological validation of astrocyte subpopulations or changes in astrocyte morphology in schizophrenia.\n\n**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  \nNo evidence was presented for astrocyte state transitions along aging or disease progression trajectories. Temporal modeling and pseudotime analyses focused on neuronal populations.\n\n**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  \nCLU upregulation in astrocytes was noted to overlap with a schizophrenia GWAS locus, but the majority of genetic risk integration and enhancer-promoter mapping focused on neuronal cell types. Only two GWAS loci were explained by astrocyte-specific differential expression, compared to dozens in neurons.\n\n<keyFinding priority='1'>CLU is broadly upregulated in astrocytes in schizophrenia and is located within a GWAS locus, but this change is not accompanied by the emergence of distinct astrocyte subtypes or major pathway alterations.</keyFinding>\n<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n<keyFinding priority='2'>Astrocytes do not show significant changes in proportion, major transcriptional reprogramming, or evidence of disease-associated subtypes in schizophrenia, in contrast to the marked heterogeneity and pathology observed in neurons.</keyFinding>\n<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nThe study suggests that astrocytes play a relatively minor or indirect role in the transcriptional pathology of schizophrenia, at least in the prefrontal cortex. The upregulation of CLU may reflect a general stress or chaperone response, but the lack of astrocyte-specific disease-associated subtypes or strong pathway alterations argues against a central mechanistic role for astrocytes in schizophrenia pathogenesis, as defined by transcriptional changes. Astrocyte CLU upregulation could potentially serve as a biomarker, but its functional significance remains unclear. The findings do not support astrocytes as a primary therapeutic target in schizophrenia, based on current data.\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**\n\nThis study provides a high-confidence, negative result regarding astrocyte heterogeneity and disease association in schizophrenia: astrocytes in the adult human prefrontal cortex do not exhibit the emergence of disease-associated subtypes, major shifts in proportion, or strong pathway-level transcriptional changes, in contrast to the marked neuronal pathology. The broad upregulation of CLU in astrocytes (and neurons) is notable and aligns with prior methylation and expression studies, but its mechanistic relevance is uncertain. These findings suggest that, at least in this brain region and disease stage, astrocyte involvement in schizophrenia is limited or secondary. Future research should address whether astrocyte heterogeneity or reactivity is more prominent in other brain regions, developmental stages, or in response to environmental stressors. The lack of astrocyte subtypes contrasts with findings in neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., Alzheimer's), and the authors do not report any explicit contradiction with prior schizophrenia models, but their results challenge hypotheses positing a central astrocyte role in schizophrenia pathogenesis based on transcriptional state. Further multi-omic and spatial studies may be needed to fully rule out subtle or non-transcriptional astrocyte contributions.\n\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

Other subtypes show loss of synaptic support, increased oxidative stress, and altered metal ion handling.

Key findings include the expansion of C3+ \"reactive\" astrocytes (Cluster 3/5) with upregulation of inflammatory, lipid metabolism, and oxidative stress genes in AD, and spatially restricted subtypes (e.g., Cluster 6 in L1/WM). All donors were APOE ε2/3, minimizing genotype confounding. These results highlight astrocyte heterogeneity and implicate specific subtypes in AD pathology.\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications (≈150 words):**  \nThis study demonstrates that astrocyte heterogeneity in AD is greater than previously appreciated, with distinct subtypes showing unique transcriptional and spatial signatures. The identification of C3+ reactive astrocytes and subtypes with altered lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, and synaptic support functions provides a framework for dissecting astrocyte contributions to neurodegeneration. The use of APOE ε2/3 donors addresses a gap in the literature, though findings may not generalize to ε4 carriers. Integration with other datasets confirms the robustness of major subtypes, but also reveals that some reactive states are spatially and pathologically restricted. Open questions include the causal role of these subtypes in disease progression, their temporal dynamics, and their response to therapeutic intervention. The study aligns with, but also extends, prior models by providing spatial and functional context for astrocyte diversity in AD.  \n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

The study did not provide detailed lists of astrocyte marker genes or directionality of expression changes, and no distinct astrocyte subtypes or disease-associated astrocyte states were identified. Instead, astrocytes were treated as a relatively homogeneous population, with no evidence for R47H-enriched subpopulations analogous to the DAM states described for microglia (<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>).\n\nPathway enrichment analysis of astrocyte DEGs did not reveal strong involvement of inflammatory, immune, or other disease-relevant pathways. This contrasts sharply with the findings in microglia, where R47H-TREM2 induced robust upregulation of proinflammatory and AKT signaling pathways. The lack of major pathway alterations in astrocytes suggests that their contribution to R47H-TREM2–mediated AD risk is minimal (<confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>).\n\nSex was identified as a modulator of astrocyte transcriptomic response, with more DEGs in males than females. However, the study did not link these changes to specific genetic (e.g., APOE genotype) or pathological (e.g., amyloid/tau burden) drivers, nor did it explore their functional significance. No astrocyte-specific gene regulatory networks, ligand-receptor interactions, or spatial/morphological findings were reported. The study also did not perform pseudotime or trajectory analyses for astrocytes, nor did it integrate astrocyte transcriptomic data with genetic risk variants or multi-omic datasets.\n\nIn summary, the study provides strong evidence that the R47H-TREM2 mutation exerts its disease-enhancing effects primarily through microglia, with astrocytes showing only minor, sex-specific transcriptomic changes and no evidence for distinct disease-associated subtypes or major pathway alterations. The findings suggest that astrocytes are not a primary mediator of R47H-TREM2–associated AD risk.\n\n<keyFinding priority='3'>\nAstrocytes in R47H-TREM2 AD brains exhibit only modest, sex-specific transcriptomic changes, with no evidence for distinct disease-associated astrocyte subtypes or major pathway alterations.

The absence of distinct disease-associated astrocyte subtypes or robust pathway changes suggests that astrocytes are not a major driver of R47H-TREM2–mediated AD risk, at least in the mid-frontal cortex and at the disease stage sampled. This finding is consistent with prior models emphasizing microglial, rather than astrocytic, mediation of TREM2-dependent AD risk (<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>). However, it remains possible that astrocyte heterogeneity or disease-associated states could be more prominent in other brain regions, at different disease stages, or in response to other genetic or environmental modifiers. Future studies with deeper astrocyte profiling, spatial transcriptomics, or functional assays may be needed to fully exclude a role for astrocytes in TREM2-related AD mechanisms. The lack of astrocyte involvement in this context also underscores the importance of targeting microglial pathways for therapeutic intervention in R47H-TREM2–associated AD.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table of Astrocyte Findings:**\n| Subtype/State | Marker Genes | Functional Signature | Disease Association | Validation |  \n|---------------|-------------|---------------------|--------------------|------------|  \n| Not specified | Not specified | No distinct signature | No enrichment in R47H-TREM2 AD | Not performed |  \n\n---\n\n**Tag Summary:**  \n<keyFinding priority='3'>Astrocytes show only modest, sex-specific transcriptomic changes in R47H-TREM2 AD, with no evidence for disease-associated subtypes or major pathway alterations.</keyFinding>  \n<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>  \n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

(2019, Nature) identify two major astrocyte subtypes with region-specific reactivity: protoplasmic (cortical) astrocytes marked by SLC1A2 and GPC5, and fibrous/reactive (white matter) astrocytes marked by GFAP and CD44. In MS, protoplasmic astrocytes downregulate glutamate and potassium homeostasis genes (SLC1A2, GLUL, KCNJ10), while fibrous astrocytes upregulate CD44, CRYAB, MT3, and transcription factors (BCL6, FOS), especially at subcortical lesion rims. These reactive states are spatially validated and are most pronounced in chronic active lesions, with no strong evidence for genetic or demographic drivers.\n\n---\n\n2) **Detailed Summary (≈800–1000 words)**\n\n<metadata>\nSchirmer L, Velmeshev D, Holmqvist S, et al. (2019). \"Neuronal vulnerability and multilineage diversity in multiple sclerosis.\" Nature 573, 75–82.  \nDisease focus: Multiple sclerosis (MS)\n</metadata>\n\n<methods>\nThe study used single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on frozen postmortem human brain tissue from 12 MS and 9 control samples, covering cortical grey matter (GM), subcortical white matter (WM), and meningeal tissue. Nuclei were isolated via sucrose-gradient ultracentrifugation, followed by 10x Genomics barcoding and sequencing. Spatial and morphological validation was performed using multiplex in situ hybridization (smFISH) and immunohistochemistry.\n</methods>\n\n<findings>\nAstrocytes were systematically characterized into two principal subtypes based on both transcriptomic and spatial features:\n\n**1. Protoplasmic (Cortical) Astrocytes**  \nThese astrocytes, abundant in cortical GM, are defined by high expression of SLC1A2 (EAAT2), GPC5, and RFX4. In situ hybridization confirmed GPC5 as a marker for protoplasmic astrocytes, co-localizing with RFX4 in GM. In MS, these cells show significant downregulation of genes involved in glutamate uptake (SLC1A2), glutamine synthesis (GLUL), and potassium buffering (KCNJ10) (<keyFinding priority='1'>), suggesting impaired homeostatic support for neurons. This downregulation is spatially validated in demyelinated GM underlying meningeal inflammation, where SLC1A2 expression is reduced.  \n<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>  \n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**2. Fibrous/Reactive (White Matter) Astrocytes**  \nThese astrocytes, prevalent in WM, are marked by GFAP and CD44. In MS, CD44 is strongly upregulated at the rim of subcortical lesions, especially in periplaque white matter (PPWM). These reactive astrocytes also express CRYAB (αB-crystallin), MT3 (metallothionein 3), and the transcription factors BCL6 and FOS, as well as the lncRNA LINC01088. Spatial transcriptomics and immunohistochemistry confirm the localization of these markers to lesion rims, with BCL6 and FOS particularly enriched in chronic active lesions.  \n<keyFinding priority='1'>  \nThe upregulation of CD44, BCL6, FOS, and LINC01088 in fibrous astrocytes at lesion rims defines a distinct, spatially restricted reactive astrocyte state in MS.  \n</keyFinding>  \n<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>  \n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Subtype Proportions and Disease Association**  \nAstrocyte numbers are not significantly depleted in MS compared to controls, but their transcriptional profiles shift markedly toward reactive states in lesion areas. The most pronounced changes are observed at the rim of chronic active subcortical lesions, where reactive astrocytes cluster and upregulate stress and immune-related genes.  \n<keyFinding priority='2'>  \nAstrocyte reactivity is regionally and lesion-stage specific, with the most severe changes at chronic active lesion rims.  \n</keyFinding>  \n<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>  \n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Pathway Enrichment and Functional Implications**  \nGene ontology analysis of differentially expressed genes in MS astrocytes highlights loss of glutamate and potassium homeostasis, and upregulation of stress response, cell adhesion, and immune signaling pathways. The downregulation of SLC1A2 and KCNJ10 in protoplasmic astrocytes may compromise neuronal support, while the upregulation of CD44 and stress-related genes in fibrous astrocytes suggests a role in scar formation and chronic inflammation.\n\n**Spatial and Morphological Validation**  \nMultiplex smFISH and immunohistochemistry confirm the spatial segregation of astrocyte subtypes and their reactive states. CD44 and GFAP are upregulated in WM lesion rims, while SLC1A2 and GPC5 are reduced in demyelinated GM. The transcription factors BCL6 and FOS, as well as LINC01088, are specifically enriched in reactive astrocytes at lesion borders.\n\n**Modulators & Metrics**  \nNo strong evidence is presented for modulation of astrocyte states by age, sex, or genetic risk alleles in this dataset. The primary driver of astrocyte reactivity is lesion location and stage (chronic active vs. inactive).\n\n**Gene Regulatory Networks**  \nBCL6 and FOS are identified as key transcriptional regulators in reactive astrocytes at lesion rims. LINC01088, a lncRNA, is also upregulated in these cells, but its functional role remains unclear.\n\n**Cell-Cell Communication**  \nThe study does not report specific ligand-receptor interactions for astrocytes, but the upregulation of CD44 suggests altered cell adhesion and potential interactions with immune cells.\n\n**Aging/Disease Trajectories**  \nAstrocyte reactivity is most pronounced in chronic active lesions, suggesting a temporal evolution from homeostatic to reactive states as lesions progress.\n\n**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**  \nNo direct integration with GWAS or eQTL data for astrocyte subtypes is reported.\n\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nAstrocyte reactivity in MS is regionally and lesion-stage specific, with protoplasmic astrocytes losing homeostatic functions in demyelinated cortex and fibrous astrocytes acquiring a reactive, stress-associated phenotype at subcortical lesion rims. These changes may contribute to impaired neuronal support, chronic inflammation, and scar formation in MS. The spatially restricted upregulation of CD44, BCL6, and FOS in reactive astrocytes could serve as potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets for modulating glial responses in progressive MS.  \n<confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> (for therapeutic implications, as these are associative)\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**\n\nThis study provides a high-resolution atlas of astrocyte heterogeneity and reactivity in MS, revealing two principal subtypes with distinct spatial and molecular signatures. The findings align with, but also extend, previous models of astrocyte diversity by demonstrating that protoplasmic and fibrous astrocytes undergo divergent reactive transformations depending on lesion location and stage. The identification of BCL6, FOS, and LINC01088 as markers of reactive astrocytes at lesion rims suggests new avenues for dissecting the regulatory networks underlying glial scar formation and chronic inflammation. Open questions remain regarding the functional consequences of these reactive states—particularly whether they are neuroprotective or detrimental in the context of chronic MS lesions. The lack of strong genetic or demographic modulators in this dataset suggests that local lesion environment is the primary driver of astrocyte reactivity. Future studies integrating longitudinal sampling, functional assays, and genetic risk stratification will be needed to clarify the causal roles of astrocyte subtypes in MS progression and repair.  \n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

Astrocyte enrichment was achieved by depleting neuronal and oligodendrocyte nuclei via FANS. Adjacent tissue was analyzed for Aβ plaque and pTau burden (immunohistochemistry, ELISA).

EC astrocytes upregulated APOE, APP, AQP4, and GJA1, and downregulated ALDH1L1, LRP1B, MAPT, and SLC1A2. V1 astrocytes upregulated CLU, GFAP, and MAOB, and downregulated AQP4 and GJA1. These regional differences were validated at the protein level by immunohistochemistry.

Predominant in all regions and stages, but reduced in EC.  \n- **astR1, astR2 (Reactive):** Upregulated GFAP, S100B, heat-shock/stress response (CRYAB, HSPA1B, HSPB8, UBC), extracellular matrix (CD44, COL21A1, GPC6, LAMA4, SERPINA3, TNC, VCAN), oxidative stress (MAOB). astR1 and astR2 differ in additional markers (e.g., C3, MAPT, SOD2 in astR1; GRIA1, SPARC in astR2). Both increased in EC/ITG and with pathology.  \n- **astR0 (Reactive):** Similar to astR1/2, with additional extracellular matrix genes (COL21A1, COL24A1, COLGAT, LAMA2). Increased with pathology and in EC.  \n- **astIM (Intermediate):** Transitional between homeostatic and reactive, expressing classic homeostatic genes at lower levels and some reactive markers (DNAH7, ETNPPL, GABRB1, GLUD1, NTRK2). Declines with pathology and along spatial axis.  \n- **astMet (Metabolic/exhausted):** Enriched for glucose metabolism (ENO1, ENO2, GAPDH, GYS1, HK1/2, LDHA, PDK1/3, PGK1, PFKP, PKM), metallothioneins (MT1E/F/G/M/X, MT2A, MT3), stress response (BAG3, HSP90AA1, HSPA1A, HSPB1, HSPH1).

Not enriched for senescence genes.  \n- **astTinf (Trophic/inflammatory):** Growth factors (FGF1/2, FGFR2, HGF, OSMR), interleukin signaling (CHI3L1, IL1R1, IL6R, ITGB1, MAPK4, SOCS3), extracellular matrix. Declines with pathology.  \nSpatial immunohistochemistry confirmed a gradient of reactive marker expression around Aβ plaques.

Homeostatic astrocytes predominate, but reactive subtypes increase in vulnerable regions and with advancing pathology. A late-stage, metabolically exhausted astrocyte state (astMet) emerges in severe AD, characterized by loss of proteostasis and energy metabolism, potentially contributing to disease progression. The exhaustion and loss of reactive programs at end-stage may represent a maladaptive response to chronic pathology. These findings suggest that astrocyte subtypes, especially the exhausted state, could serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets, but causal roles remain to be established. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**  \nThis large-scale snRNA-seq study of 628,943 astrocytes across five brain regions and all stages of Alzheimer’s disease reveals that astrocyte subtypes—including homeostatic, multiple reactive, and two novel states (a trophic/inflammatory and a metabolically exhausted subtype)—show distinct spatial and temporal dynamics. The exhausted astrocyte state (astMet), marked by upregulation of glycolytic and metallothionein genes and loss of proteostasis, peaks at late-stage pathology and is more frequent in females. These findings highlight region- and stage-specific astrocyte responses and identify exhaustion as a potential maladaptive endpoint in chronic AD.\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications (≈150 words):**  \nThis study provides a comprehensive atlas of astrocyte heterogeneity in human AD, revealing that astrocyte responses are not uniform but instead follow complex, region- and stage-dependent trajectories. The identification of a metabolically exhausted astrocyte state (astMet) that emerges only at late-stage pathology and then declines at end-stage suggests a previously unrecognized phase of astrocyte dysfunction, distinct from classic reactive states. This exhaustion is not captured in most prior studies, likely due to limited regional or stage sampling. The findings challenge the binary homeostatic/reactive model and support a dynamic, multi-state framework for astrocyte involvement in AD. Open questions include the causal role of the exhausted state in neurodegeneration, its reversibility, and its potential as a therapeutic target. The study’s subtypes partially align with known schemes (e.g., homeostatic/reactive), but the exhausted and trophic/inflammatory states are novel.

Astro4 expresses VEGFA and is enriched for cell–matrix adhesion and carbohydrate binding pathways, while Astro5 is uniquely enriched for immune response pathways (e.g., Toll-like receptor cascade) and expresses high levels of GFAP.\n\nAstro6 is distinguished by strong upregulation of metallothionein genes (MT1G, MT1F, MT2A, MT3) and is functionally enriched for metal ion homeostasis.\n\n<keyFinding priority='1'>Astro5 and Astro6 subtypes increase in proportion with higher local amyloid-β and pTau pathology, while homeostatic Astro1 nuclei decrease correspondingly.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Defining Marker Genes and Functional Signatures**\n\n- **Astro5**: Upregulates GFAP, immune response genes, and is enriched for Toll-like receptor and inflammatory pathways.\n- **Astro6**: Upregulates metallothioneins (MT1G, MT1F, MT2A, MT3), FTL, and is enriched for metal ion homeostasis and oxidative stress response.\n- Both Astro5 and Astro6 show upregulation of chaperones (CRYAB, HSPB1, HSPH1, HSP90AA1), and inflammatory mediators (NLRP3 inflammasome, NF-κB pathway).\n\n<keyFinding priority='1'>Astrocyte subtypes in AD are defined by coordinated upregulation of metal ion homeostasis, proteostasis, and inflammatory genes, with CLU (clusterin) as a hub gene in a module enriched for these functions.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**\n\nVolcano plots (Fig. 2a–c) show that hundreds of genes are upregulated in astrocytes with increasing amyloid-β and pTau pathology.

This module also includes GJA1 (Connexin-43) and is functionally linked to chaperone and gap junction pathways.\n\nTranscription factors upregulated in disease-associated astrocytes include MEF2C, MAFG, JUND, CEBPB, MAF, and LHX2, suggesting a regulatory program for the observed stress and inflammatory responses.\n\n<keyFinding priority='2'>CLU-centric modules and associated regulons (MAF, MAFG, JUND, CEBPB) are consistently upregulated with pathology and are reproducible in external datasets.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Spatial and Morphological Validation**\n\nImmunohistochemistry confirmed increased astrocyte density (astrogliosis) in AD, and the expansion of disease-associated subtypes (Astro5/Astro6) correlated with local amyloid-β and pTau burden.\n\n**Aging/Disease Trajectories**\n\nAstro5 and Astro6 expansion is observed along a trajectory of increasing pathology, with a corresponding decline in homeostatic Astro1. This suggests a shift from homeostatic to stress/inflammatory/proteostatic states as disease progresses.\n\n**Comparison to Prior Models**\n\nThe disease-associated astrocyte (DAA) gene set from mouse models is upregulated in all astrocyte clusters except Astro3, but neither A1 nor A2 (injury/homeostatic) gene sets are specifically enriched, consistent with recent human studies. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Modulators & Metrics**\n\nNo significant sex differences were observed. The astrocyte response is tightly linked to local pathology rather than global Braak stage or demographic variables.\n\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nAstrocytes in AD undergo a marked shift from homeostatic to disease-associated states (Astro5/Astro6) characterized by upregulation of metal ion homeostasis, proteostasis, and inflammatory pathways. These changes are strongly associated with local amyloid-β and pTau pathology and may reflect both neuroprotective (e.g., chaperone, metallothionein) and neurotoxic (e.g., inflammasome, NF-κB) responses. The identification of CLU as a hub gene in these modules suggests a mechanistic link to AD risk and highlights potential therapeutic or biomarker targets.

The CLU-centered co-expression module aligns with known AD risk and proteostasis pathways, supporting its relevance as a biomarker or therapeutic target. The lack of clear A1/A2 astrocyte polarization and the partial overlap with mouse DAA signatures underscore the need for human-specific classification schemes. Open questions include the functional consequences of these astrocyte states—whether they are protective, deleterious, or context-dependent—and their temporal dynamics in disease progression. Future work should address causality, the impact of genetic risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype), and the interplay with microglia and other cell types.

(2024) presents a comprehensive single-cell RNA-seq resource profiling live human microglia across a wide spectrum of neurological diseases and CNS regions. The experimental design specifically targeted the isolation and characterization of microglia, using FACS sorting for CD45+ cells and cold, enzyme-free dissociation to preserve native transcriptomic states. While the initial cell suspensions inevitably included a small proportion of non-myeloid cells, including astrocytes, the analytic focus was strictly on microglial heterogeneity.\n\nAstrocytes were identified in the initial clustering of all CD45+ cells, using canonical markers such as GFAP, SNAP25, and OLIG2 to distinguish non-immune (astrocyte, neuronal, oligodendrocyte) populations from microglia, monocytes, and adaptive immune cells (Extended Data Fig. 1). The authors report that astrocytes and other glial/neuronal cells comprised only a minor fraction of the sorted population, with microglia representing the overwhelming majority (~96%). This is consistent with the expected enrichment for myeloid cells in CD45+ FACS-sorted brain tissue.\n\nAfter this initial cell-type demarcation, astrocytes were excluded from all further analyses. The study did not perform subclustering, differential gene expression, or pathway enrichment analyses for astrocytes. No astrocyte subtypes or cell states were defined, and no disease- or region-specific changes in astrocyte proportions or transcriptomes were reported. The authors did not investigate astrocyte functional signatures, gene regulatory networks, or cell-cell communication involving astrocytes.\n\nSpatial and morphological validation, including RNAscope–immunofluorescence and MERFISH, was performed exclusively for microglial markers and subtypes. Astrocytes were not included in these validation panels, nor were they analyzed for spatial distribution or morphological features.\n\nNo analyses of astrocyte associations with disease status, pathology (e.g., amyloid, tau), clinical variables, or genetic risk factors were conducted. The study’s cross-sectional design and analytic pipeline were tailored to microglial diversity, and astrocytes were not considered in disease trajectory or genetic integration analyses.\n\nThe authors explicitly state that their resource is intended as a reference for microglial heterogeneity and as a tool for annotating microglial states in model systems and chemical perturbation screens.

The exclusion of astrocytes from all downstream analyses reflects both the myeloid enrichment strategy (CD45+ FACS sorting) and the study’s explicit focus on microglia. As such, the dataset cannot be used to investigate astrocyte subtypes, disease associations, or functional states. Researchers interested in astrocyte biology in neurological disease will need to turn to other resources—ideally those using unbiased or astrocyte-enriching isolation strategies and dedicated astrocyte-focused analyses. No conflicts or contradictions with prior astrocyte literature are discussed, as astrocytes were not analyzed. The study highlights the importance of cell-type-specific design in single-cell studies and the need for complementary resources to address astrocyte heterogeneity in human brain disease.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table of Tag Usage:**  \n- <keyFinding priority='3'>Astrocytes present but not analyzed</keyFinding>\n- <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>\n- <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

However, these changes are less pronounced than those observed in neurons or microglia and are not strongly linked to clinical severity or core ASD symptoms. The findings imply a possible, but secondary, role for astrocyte activation in ASD pathophysiology, potentially reflecting a response to altered neuronal or microglial states rather than a primary driver of disease (<keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>). There are no immediate therapeutic or biomarker implications for astrocyte subtypes based on this study.\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications**\n\nThis study provides evidence for increased density and activation of protoplasmic astrocytes in ASD cortex, but does not identify novel disease-specific astrocyte subtypes or strong functional pathway enrichment. The astrocyte changes observed are consistent with a shift toward an activated state, but are less robust and less clinically relevant than neuronal or microglial alterations. Open questions remain regarding the causal role of astrocyte activation in ASD: whether these changes are a consequence of altered neuronal activity, a response to microglial signaling, or contribute independently to ASD pathology. The lack of strong pathway enrichment or correlation with clinical severity suggests that astrocyte changes may be secondary or compensatory. Future studies with larger cohorts, spatial transcriptomics, or functional assays will be needed to clarify the significance of astrocyte activation in ASD and to determine whether more subtle or regionally restricted astrocyte subtypes exist. The findings are broadly consistent with prior models of glial activation in neurodevelopmental disorders, and no explicit conflicts with previous astrocyte classification schemes are discussed by the authors.\n\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

Science Advances. 2024 Jan 10;10:eadi8287.\nDisease focus: Parkinson’s disease (PD)\n</metadata>\n\n<methods>\nSingle-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on postmortem human substantia nigra (SN) from 23 idiopathic PD and 9 control donors (average age ~81). 315,867 high-quality nuclei were analyzed using Seurat/Harmony for clustering and annotation. Validation included immunohistochemistry (IHC), RNAscope in situ hybridization, and comparison with human midbrain organoids and mouse SN.\n</methods>\n\n---\n\n**Quick Reference**\n\nAstrocytes in the human substantia nigra were profiled using snRNA-seq, revealing no major disease-associated astrocyte subtypes or marked transcriptional activation in Parkinson’s disease. Astrocyte proportions were stable between PD and controls, and while some stress-response genes were upregulated, there was no evidence for a robust inflammatory or reactive astrocyte state. Genetic risk for PD was not enriched in astrocytes, and PRKN (PARK2) was the only PD gene with notable astrocytic expression. <keyFinding priority='2'>Astrocyte transcriptomic changes in PD were modest and did not support a major disease-driving or reactive role in this region.</keyFinding> Age and disease stage did not significantly modulate astrocyte states. <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n---\n\n**Detailed Summary**\n\n<findings>\nAstrocytes (cluster c2) comprised 8.4% of all nuclei in the human SN, making them the fourth most abundant cell type after oligodendrocytes, neurons, and microglia (Fig. 1D). Annotation was based on canonical markers such as AQP4 and GFAP (Fig. 1C). The proportion of astrocytes was similar between PD and control samples, with no significant quantitative loss or expansion in disease (Fig. 1E).\n\n**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  \nThe study did not report further subclustering of astrocytes or identification of distinct astrocyte subtypes or states in the SN. Unlike neurons and microglia, where multiple subtypes and disease-associated states were described, astrocytes were treated as a single, relatively homogeneous population. There was no evidence for a disease-associated astrocyte (DAA) or A1/A2-like reactive subpopulation in the SN.\n\n**Differential Gene Expression:**  \nAstrocytes in PD showed upregulation of a limited set of stress-response genes, notably metallothioneins (e.g., MT2A, MT1E, MT3) and heat shock proteins (e.g., HSPB1, HSPH1, HSPA1, HSP90AA1), which were broadly induced across multiple cell types (Fig. 5C). These changes are interpreted as part of a general cellular stress response rather than a specific astrocyte activation signature. There was no upregulation of classical inflammatory or reactive astrocyte markers (e.g., C3, GFAP, Serpina3n), nor evidence for a pan-glial activation state as reported in some prior studies of PD or other neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n**Pathway Enrichment:**  \nFunctional enrichment in astrocytes highlighted translation and protein folding pathways (HSF1 activation), consistent with a mild stress response. There was no enrichment for inflammatory, complement, or cytokine pathways in astrocytes.\n\n**Modulators & Metrics:**  \nNo significant modulation of astrocyte states by age, sex, or Braak stage was reported. Temporal analysis across Braak stages did not reveal stage-specific astrocyte activation or suppression. <keyFinding priority='2'>Astrocyte transcriptomic profiles remained stable across disease progression.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  \nAstrocytes did not show enrichment for expression of PD GWAS risk genes. Of the 22 familial PD genes examined, only PRKN (PARK2) was notably expressed in astrocytes, but it was not differentially regulated in PD (Fig. 6A). No astrocyte-specific eQTL or genetic risk association was identified.\n\n**Cell-Cell Communication:**  \nCellChat analysis indicated that astrocytes (c2) had stable incoming and outgoing ligand-receptor signaling in PD, with no major gain or loss of communication strength (Fig. 7B). There was no evidence for astrocyte-driven disruption or activation of signaling pathways relevant to PD pathogenesis.\n\n**Spatial Analysis:**  \nNo spatial or morphological validation of astrocyte subpopulations was reported. Immunostaining and in situ hybridization focused on neuronal and microglial markers.\n\n**Contradictions/Departures:**  \nThe authors explicitly note that, in contrast to some prior reports of pan-glial activation or reactive astrocyte states in PD or Alzheimer’s disease, their data do not support a major role for astrocyte activation in the SN in PD. They discuss that previous studies reporting reactive astrocytes may have focused on different brain regions or disease stages, or used different analytic approaches. <contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag> The authors state: “In our study, we found little evidence supporting the extensive activation of inflammation-related molecules or disease-associated microglia signature in glial clusters… The discrepancy of the results could be due to many factors such as sample sources and analytic procedures. It remains possible that glia become less active at advanced stage of PD as shown in our study.”\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nAstrocytes in the SN do not appear to play a major disease-driving or reactive role in idiopathic PD, at least at advanced stages. The absence of robust astrocyte activation or disease-associated subtypes suggests that astrocytes are not a primary source of neuroinflammatory signaling or neurodegeneration in this region. The mild upregulation of stress-response genes may reflect a general response to the disease environment rather than a cell-intrinsic pathogenic process. There is no evidence from this study to support astrocyte-targeted therapies or biomarker development in SN for PD. <keyFinding priority='2'>Astrocyte involvement in PD pathogenesis in the SN is likely limited or secondary.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications**\n\nThis study provides strong evidence that astrocytes in the human substantia nigra are relatively stable and do not undergo major disease-associated activation or subtype diversification in Parkinson’s disease, at least at advanced stages. The lack of a reactive or inflammatory astrocyte signature contrasts with some prior reports in other brain regions or diseases, highlighting the importance of regional and disease-stage specificity. The findings suggest that future research should focus on other glial or neuronal populations for understanding PD pathogenesis in the SN. Open questions remain regarding astrocyte roles at earlier disease stages, in other brain regions, or in genetic forms of PD. The absence of astrocyte enrichment for PD risk genes further deprioritizes this cell type as a primary driver of disease in the SN. <contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag> The authors explicitly discuss the contrast with prior models of pan-glial activation, attributing discrepancies to region, stage, or technical factors.

The integration of DAA networks with microglial DAM networks and metabolite-enzyme associations points to coordinated glial responses and metabolic triggers in AD neuroinflammation. Open questions include whether additional astrocyte subtypes or temporal trajectories exist in other datasets, and how DAA interact with other glial and neuronal populations in situ. The study’s network-based drug repurposing approach provides a framework for identifying and validating astrocyte-targeted therapies, but functional and longitudinal validation of DAA’s causal role in AD remains needed.

In human AD, astrocytes showed a loss of a metabolically active subpopulation (Astro3) characterized by genes involved in lipid metabolism and oxidative stress protection (e.g., FABP5, HILPDA, SOD2), and upregulation of extracellular matrix genes (NCAN, COL5A3) linked to glial scarring. These changes were largely independent of TREM2 genotype, contrasting with the modest, GFAP-driven astrocyte response in mouse models. <keyFinding priority='1'>Astrocyte metabolic dysfunction and glial scarring signatures are prominent in human AD, with loss of the Astro3 subpopulation and upregulation of NCAN/COL5A3.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>\n\n---\n\n2) **Detailed Summary**\n\n<metadata>\nZhou Y, Song WM, Andhey PS, et al.

This diverges from the A1/A2 paradigm established in mouse models and underscores the need for human-centric frameworks of astrocyte reactivity in neurodegeneration. Open questions include whether loss of Astro3 is a cause or consequence of neuronal degeneration, and whether interventions that preserve or restore this subpopulation could mitigate disease progression. The lack of TREM2 effect on astrocyte signatures, despite its strong influence on microglia, further highlights cell-type-specific mechanisms in AD. Future studies should employ spatial transcriptomics and functional assays to clarify the roles of these astrocyte states in vivo, and to determine their potential as biomarkers or therapeutic targets. <contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag> The authors explicitly discuss the contrast between human and mouse astrocyte responses, cautioning against direct extrapolation from animal models to human disease."

Cell types were annotated using canonical markers, and subclustering was performed for major populations. Validation included immunostaining and immunoprecipitation in wild-type and 5×FAD mice.\n</methods>\n\n<findings>\nAstrocytes (Ast) were among the 19 major cell types robustly identified in the single-cell atlas of the human and mouse AD brain. The initial UMAP and marker gene analyses (Fig. 1B–C) confirmed the presence of astrocytes using canonical markers (not explicitly listed in the main text, but likely including GFAP, AQP4, SLC1A2, etc., per CellMarker and standard practice).\n\n**Cell Type Proportions:**  \nAstrocytes were consistently detected in both AD and control brains, but the study does not report significant quantitative changes in astrocyte abundance or major shifts in their proportion relative to other cell types. The volcano plots and spatial transcriptomics (Fig. 1D–F) highlight mitochondrial gene dysregulation primarily in neurons, with no mention of astrocyte-specific changes.\n\n**Differential Gene Expression:**  \nThe main differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and pathway alterations described in the paper are centered on neuronal and microglial populations. The authors do not report astrocyte-specific DEGs or highlight any astrocyte subpopulations with disease-associated transcriptional signatures. The global DEG analysis (Fig. 1D) does not single out astrocytes for notable mitochondrial or stress pathway dysregulation.\n\n**Pathway Enrichment:**  \nPathway analyses focus on mitophagy, cell death, and metabolic reprogramming in neurons, with microglial involvement in intercellular signaling. There is no evidence presented for astrocyte-specific pathway enrichment or activation of inflammatory, metabolic, or neuroprotective programs in AD.\n\n**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  \nAstrocytes are treated as a single, relatively homogeneous population in this study. The authors do not report the identification of distinct astrocyte subtypes or states (e.g., A1/A2, reactive, disease-associated astrocytes) in their clustering or spatial analyses. No marker gene sets or functional annotations are provided for astrocyte subclusters, and no disease-associated astrocyte states are described.\n\n**Modulators & Metrics:**  \nThe study does not report any host or genetic factors (age, sex, APOE genotype, GWAS variants) that modulate astrocyte abundance, activation, or transcriptional state. Quantitative activation or reactivity scores for astrocytes are not discussed.\n\n**Gene Regulatory Networks, Cell-Cell Communication, Spatial Analysis:**  \nThe paper’s major mechanistic focus is on microglia-neuron crosstalk (PTPRG–CNTN4 axis) and the regulation of neuronal mitophagy via VIRMA and PRKN.

This contrasts with some prior studies that have reported reactive or disease-associated astrocyte states (e.g., A1/A2, DAA) in AD and other neurodegenerative conditions. The absence of astrocyte heterogeneity or activation in this dataset may reflect differences in tissue sampling, sequencing depth, or analytical focus, as the authors prioritized neuronal and microglial mechanisms. The findings suggest that, at least in the sampled regions and disease stages, astrocytes do not undergo major transcriptional reprogramming in AD, and their role may be secondary to microglia-neuron crosstalk and neuronal mitophagy failure. Future studies should address whether more subtle or region-specific astrocyte changes occur, or whether astrocyte heterogeneity emerges at later disease stages or in response to specific pathological triggers. The lack of astrocyte activation in this study raises important questions about the context-dependence of astrocyte responses in AD and highlights the need for further multi-omic and spatially resolved investigations.\n\n<contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>\nThe authors do not explicitly discuss conflicts with prior reports of disease-associated astrocyte states, but their findings diverge from some recent single-nucleus RNA-seq studies that have identified reactive astrocyte subtypes in AD.

Their overall proportion did not significantly differ between PD and controls, as shown by both snRNA-seq and in situ quantification (<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>). However, astrocytes exhibited one of the largest numbers of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among all glial types in PD, indicating a pronounced transcriptional response.\n\n**Astrocyte Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  \nThe study did not report discrete astrocyte subtypes or disease-associated astrocyte (DAA) clusters within the prefrontal cortex. Instead, astrocytes were treated as a single transcriptional population for DEG and pathway analyses. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Differential Gene Expression & Pathway Enrichment:**  \nAstrocytes in PD showed significant upregulation of genes involved in heavy metal detoxification, particularly metallothioneins MT1G, MT1F, and MT3. These genes are known to bind and sequester metals such as iron, copper, and zinc, which accumulate in PD brains. GO pathway analysis highlighted “detoxification of heavy metals,” “cellular response to cadmium ion,” and “response to metal ion” as the most enriched upregulated pathways in astrocytes (<keyFinding priority='1'>Astrocytes upregulate metallothioneins and metal detoxification pathways in PD</keyFinding>). <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>\n\nDownregulated pathways in astrocytes were less prominent but included coagulation-related processes (VAV3, LYN, UBASH3B), suggesting a response to cellular injury or altered vascular interactions. <keyFinding priority='2'>Astrocytes downregulate coagulation pathways in PD</keyFinding>. <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>\n\n**Cell Type Proportions:**  \nAstrocyte abundance was stable between PD and controls, as confirmed by both snRNA-seq and RNAscope quantification.

Notably, interactions involving astrocytic EGFR and neuronal ligands (TGF-β, betacellulin) were lost, as were SIRPA/CD47 and ACVR/GAS6 signaling pairs. This suggests a selective abatement of neuron-astrocyte communication in PD, potentially contributing to neuroinflammatory processes. <keyFinding priority='2'>Neuron-astrocyte interactions are selectively reduced in PD, indicating impaired neuro-glial cross-talk</keyFinding>. <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>\n\n**Pathway and Disease Comparisons:**  \nComparison with a published AD snRNA-seq dataset (Mathys et al., Nature 2019) revealed that astrocytic upregulation of metallothioneins and metal detoxification pathways is a shared feature of both PD and AD.

Thus, astrocytic transcriptional changes are attributed to disease status rather than demographic or technical confounders.\n\n**Gene Regulatory Networks & Multi-omic Integration:**  \nNo astrocyte-specific transcription factors or regulatory modules were highlighted. Proteomic modules enriched for astrocyte markers (SLC14A1, AQP4, AGT) were identified, but the most prominent proteomic changes in PD were synaptic and microglial, not astrocytic.\n\n**Spatial Analysis:**  \nNo spatially distinct astrocyte subpopulations or morphological changes were reported.

Open questions remain regarding the functional consequences of astrocytic metallothionein upregulation—whether it is neuroprotective, maladaptive, or both—and whether modulating these pathways can alter disease progression. The observed loss of neuron-astrocyte interactions in PD raises the possibility that restoring glial support or communication could be beneficial. Future studies should address whether astrocytic responses are region-specific, how they evolve with disease stage, and whether they are modulated by genetic risk factors.

Future research should clarify whether the loss of regional identity is a cause or consequence of neurodegeneration, and whether specific astrocyte subpopulations contribute to disease progression or resilience.
