Microglia, the resident immune cells of the central nervous system, have emerged as key mediators of neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders through advances in single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomics. Across multiple studies, their role has been explored via large-scale profiling of postmortem human brain tissue, integration with genetic and epigenetic data, and in vitro or in silico validation. In Alzheimer’s disease, a wealth of evidence points to microglia as central interpreters of genetic risk. One large-scale single-nucleus RNA-seq mapping identified microglia-specific eQTLs at the APOE locus, showing that variants such as rs2288911 drive APOE expression solely in these cells and correlate with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (Fujita M, Gao Z, Zeng L, et al., 2024). In parallel, microglial eQTLs frequently colocalize with Alzheimer’s GWAS variants at loci including BIN1, underscoring that disease susceptibility in AD is strongly channeled through microglial regulatory programs. Another dataset, focusing on a separate large cohort, confirmed that microglia harbor disproportionately many AD risk colocalizations and can express novel genes such as PTPRG specifically in AD (Hoffman GE, Lee D, Bendl J, et al., 2023). These discoveries reveal that microglial gene regulation, rather than their bulk abundance, is often crucial to AD pathology.

Despite this genetic evidence, not all studies find clearly delineated or invariant disease-associated microglial states in AD. One snRNA-seq survey of caudal entorhinal cortex observed only modest microglial changes and failed to detect canonical disease-associated microglial (DAM) signatures, attributing the absence of robust signals to technical limitations such as low gene detection in nuclei (Leng K, Li E, Eser R, et al., 2021). In contrast, others report pronounced shifts in microglial subpopulations linked to amyloid, tau, or vascular pathology. An extensive atlas of the aged human prefrontal cortex highlighted an expansion of microglia in late-stage AD, with upregulation of TYROBP-related networks (Mathys et al., 2023), while a separate analysis pinpointed multiple reactive microglial subclusters enriched for phagocytic and lipid metabolism genes, often overlapping TREM2-dependent pathways (Morabito S, Miyoshi E, Michael N, et al., 2021). Fine-grained analyses reveal that microglia can assume different roles in AD depending on the type of pathology. Some researchers have described microglial states associated primarily with amyloid-β plaques (AD1) versus those oriented toward tau (AD2) (Gerrits E, Brouwer N, Kooistra SM, et al., 2021). A separate study demonstrated that upregulation of APOE, BIN1, and other canonical risk genes arises specifically in a disease-associated cluster, M1, highlighting a potential convergence of microglial activation and AD susceptibility (Grubman A, Chew G, Ouyang JF, et al., 2019). Nevertheless, microglia do not always account for all AD genetic burden. One investigation found that integrative somatic mosaicism studies showed no increased mutational load specifically in microglia (Kousi M, Boix C, Park YP, et al., 2022). Others note that in some subregions or cohorts, microglial changes are minimal (Otero-Garcia M, Mahajani SU, Wakhloo D, et al., 2022; Sadick JS, O’Dea MR, Hasel P, et al., 2022), demonstrating that region- and study-specific factors can limit the detection of microglial involvement.

Within the Alzheimer’s context, there is also an emerging focus on mechanistic transformations in microglia tied to TREM2, APOE, and newly recognized pathways. One group described a microglial cell population termed Mic1, defined by MHC class II and APOE upregulation, strongly linked to AD pathology and modulated by sex-specific differences (Mathys et al., 2019). Other work highlights a subpopulation labeled Mic_PTPRG that expands in disease, forming novel microglia-neuron crosstalk patterns via a PTPRG–CNTN4 axis and thereby potentially impairing neuronal mitophagy (Zou D, Wang F, Qi J, et al., 2024). Intriguingly, multi-ancestry or multi-omic integration consistently underscores microglia as the cell type most strongly enriched for AD heritability, with microglia-specific eQTLs at risk loci such as BIN1, EPHA1-AS1, and SORL1 (Hoffman G, Lee D, Bendl J, et al., 2024). Overall, the AD literature converges on microglial regulatory architecture as a major mediator of disease, though the precise subtypes and their functional consequences vary across cohorts and brain regions.

Beyond Alzheimer’s disease, microglia play diverse roles in other neurodegenerative conditions. In Parkinson’s disease, microglial reactivity has been consistently reported in the substantia nigra. One study showed a shift from homeostatic P2RY12+ microglia toward GPNMB+, HSP90AA1+, or IL1B+ subpopulations in idiopathic PD, with morphological evidence of amoeboid, activated states (Smajic S, Prada-Medina CA, Landoulsi Z, et al., 2022). Another investigation described a TREM2-independent disease-associated subset that upregulates PTPRG, thereby regulating neuronal viability through mitophagy pathways (Zou D, Wang F, Qi J, et al., 2024). By contrast, some large-scale epigenomic or single-nucleus studies default to highlighting microglial dysregulation via AD-related risk variants rather than PD-focused risk, though a few have found PD GWAS SNP enrichment in microglial enhancers. Within multiple sclerosis, disease-associated microglia similarly appear, but the complexity of MS lesions underscores patient-specific factors. Researchers profiling MS white matter lesions have identified at least seven microglial subtypes, with shifts from homeostatic P2RY12+ subtypes toward reactive GPNMB+, IL1B+ states in active and chronic lesions (Macnair L, Zhou T, Somasundaram AJ, et al., 2024). These changes, however, are driven more by individual patient identity than by lesion type, hinting that microglial phenotypes in MS can be strongly shaped by personalized disease trajectories or genetic background. Conversely, some groups investigating progressive MS or its T-cell infiltration have not detailed significant microglial findings (Kaufmann M, Evans H, Schaupp A-L, et al., 2021), reflecting a focus on other immune components.

Microglia have also been examined in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, frontotemporal dementia, psychiatric conditions, and COVID-19. In one cross-condition single-nucleus study of ALS and FTD, microglia showed only modest transcriptional changes, indicating that other glial types (e.g., astrocytes, oligodendrocytes) might carry the bulk of disease-specific alterations (Li J, Jaiswal MK, Chien J-F, et al., 2023). Likewise, minimal microglial signatures emerged in certain cohorts with schizophrenia or epilepsy, where transcriptomic changes instead localized to neurons or astrocytes (Herrero MJ, Velmeshev D, Hernandez-Pineda D, et al., 2020; Pfisterer U, Petukhov V, Demharter S, et al., 2020). However, another large study of the prefrontal cortex in COVID-19 found a robust microglial activation state (C3+, phagocytic genes upregulated) despite minimal direct SARS-CoV-2 in brain tissue, revealing that peripheral immune signaling can drive a pronounced microglial response (Fullard JF, Lee H-C, Voloudakis G, et al., 2021). In major depressive disorder, recent evidence shows sex-specific microglial changes: a large dataset revealed that female MDD microglia upregulate ion channel and neuronal signaling genes, while inflammatory pathways are suppressed, an effect absent in male MDD samples (Matira M, Tiwari R, Castro B, et al., 2023). These findings illustrate that microglial phenotypes can exhibit not only disease- but also sex-specific distinctions.

A frequent theme emerging across these investigations is that microglia display considerable heterogeneity both at the population and individual donor level. Several authors emphasize that patient identity or unmeasured environmental factors explain more variance in microglial transcriptional states than do basic demographic or clinical phenotypes (Johansen N, Somasundaram S, Travaglini KJ, et al., 2023; Macnair L, Zhou T, Somasundaram AJ, et al., 2024). Even in ostensibly healthy adult cortices, inflammatory and immune response genes (e.g., CCL3, CCL4) can differ widely among donors, complicating the interpretation of microglial activation in disease. Some analyses suggest near-absence of microglial pathology in certain disorders, as shown in Rett syndrome, where MECP2-mutant versus wild-type cells did not diverge in microglial gene expression (Renthal W, Boxer LD, Hrvatin S, et al., 2018). Likewise, mosaic studies of Huntington’s or epilepsy cohorts sometimes identify minimal microglial dysregulation or fail to detect disease-specific subpopulations (Al-Dalahmah O, Sosunov AA, Shaik A, et al., 2020; Pfisterer U, Petukhov V, Demharter S, et al., 2020). These negative or partial findings underscore that transcriptional perturbations in microglia can be subtle, confined to select regions, or overshadowed by changes in other glial subsets.

Collectively, single-nucleus transcriptomic studies clarify that microglia in human brain disorders often occupy multiple activation states, ranging from homeostatic (P2RY12+, CX3CR1+, TMEM119+) to reactive subtypes upregulating APOE, TREM2, or pro-inflammatory genes (IL1B, CCL3). Many of these states appear shared across diseases, yet certain disorders, such as advanced AD, show specialized subpopulations (e.g., Mic1, DAM2) implicated in amyloid or tau pathology, while PD microglia can exhibit TREM2-independent expansions or GPNMB+ subtypes. Mechanistically, disease-linked genetic variants frequently map to microglial enhancer regions, with cell type–specific eQTLs driving expression of critical risk genes in microglia. Future work aims to integrate these transcriptomic and epigenomic findings with functional assays in iPSC-derived or xenografted microglial models, including cell–cell interaction analyses and precise mapping of TREM2 or APOE regulatory effects. Spatial transcriptomics and morphological validation will help pinpoint how microglial subpopulations organize around plaques, lesions, or specific cortical circuits, while multi-ancestry studies offer deeper insight into how population genetics modifies microglial responses. Many questions remain regarding the significance of strongly activated subpopulations: whether they are deleterious or protective, stable or reversible, and how best to modulate them therapeutically. Nonetheless, the expanding single-nucleus literature unambiguously confirms that microglia are central orchestrators of genetic and inflammatory processes across a range of neurodegenerative, neuroimmune, and psychiatric conditions, with disease-specific and even sex-specific programs shaping their pathogenic or homeostatic roles.

Microglia, as the resident immune cells in the central nervous system, exert critical functions in development, homeostasis, and disease pathogenesis. A growing body of single-cell and single-nucleus transcriptomic studies has elucidated extensive microglial heterogeneity, with different subtypes emerging across neurodegenerative, neuropsychiatric, and acute brain injury contexts. In Alzheimer’s disease (AD), multiple investigations have identified disease-associated microglia (DAM) or related states that are characterized by upregulation of phagocytic, inflammatory, and lipid metabolism genes and by partial loss of homeostatic markers. One early analysis (Lau, S.-F., Cao, H., Fu, A.K.Y., & Ip, N.Y. (2020). Single-nucleus transcriptome analysis reveals dysregulation of angiogenic endothelial cells and neuroprotective glia in Alzheimer’s disease. PNAS, 117(41): 25800–25809) observed 13 microglial subpopulations in the AD prefrontal cortex, with a notable cluster expressing complement genes (C1QA/B/C) that was reduced in disease and implicated in synaptic pruning deficits. Subsequent work (Cain A, Taga M, McCabe C, et al. "Multicellular communities are perturbed in the aging human brain and Alzheimer’s disease." Nature Neuroscience, 2023. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-023-01356-x) confirmed microglial diversity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, reporting five major subtypes and highlighting redox- and interferon-response populations linked to tau pathology and cognitive decline. Additional large-scale profiling (Gabito MI, Travaglini KJ, Rachleff VM, et al. "Integrated multimodal cell atlas of Alzheimer’s disease." Nature Neuroscience. 2024 Dec;27:2366–2383. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-024-01774-5) identified a robust disease-associated microglial state (Micro-PVM_3) with upregulation of phagocytic and inflammatory genes, termed “DAM-like,” strongly increased in AD and enriched for inflammatory transcripts (APOE, CST7, SPP1). Though other analyses (Mathys et al. (2024). "Single-cell multiregion dissection of Alzheimer’s disease." Nature 632, 858–868. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-024-07606-7) did not detect extensive microglial heterogeneity, many still reported immune-activation genes, complement components, or metabolic reprogramming. Single-cell and multi-omics approaches have further illuminated genetic influences on microglia in AD. For instance, Sayed FA, Kodama L, Fan L, et al. "AD-linked R47H-TREM2 mutation induces disease-enhancing microglial states via AKT hyperactivation." Science Translational Medicine, 13(625):eabe3947, 2021, showed that the R47H-TREM2 variant leads to an exaggerated proinflammatory microglial phenotype. Related work (Marinaro F, Moritz Haneklaus, Zhechun Zhang, et al. (2020). "Molecular and cellular pathology of monogenic Alzheimer’s disease at single cell resolution." bioRxiv. https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.07.14.202317) highlighted a disease-specific microglial activation program in familial AD, distinct from acute injury responses. Some groups have observed less overt microglial involvement in AD severity: for example, Davila-Velderrain J, Mathys H, Mohammadi S, et al. "Single-cell anatomical analysis of human hippocampus and entorhinal cortex uncovers early-stage molecular pathology in Alzheimer’s disease." bioRxiv 2021.07.01.450715 found robust microglial transcriptomic changes primarily late in disease, suggesting context-dependent activation.

Microglia also undergo pronounced activation in Parkinson’s disease (PD). One single-cell profile (Kamath T, Abdulraouf A, Burris SJ, et al. Single-cell genomic profiling of human dopamine neurons identifies a population that selectively degenerates in Parkinson’s disease. Nature Neuroscience. 2022 May;25(5):588–595. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-022-01061-1) demonstrated an increased microglial proinflammatory signature, although the most prominent changes were in dopamine neurons. Another investigation (Martirosyan et al., 2024, "Integrated multimodal cell atlas of Alzheimer’s disease," Nature Neuroscience) primarily addressed AD, but separate work on PD, exemplified by Zhu B, Park J-M, Coffey SR, et al. (2024). "Single-nucleus transcriptomic and proteomic analysis of Parkinson’s disease brains." Science Translational Medicine 16, eabo1997, reported elevated microglial numbers in late-stage PD, with inflammatory gene upregulation (e.g., FOS, STAT3, IL4R) and high expression of the risk gene LRRK2. A more detailed PD-focused study (Limone F, Mordes DA, Couto A, et al. (2024). "Single-nucleus sequencing reveals enriched expression of genetic risk factors in extratelencephalic neurons sensitive to degeneration in ALS." Nature Aging, 4:984–997. https://doi.org/10.1038/s43587-024-00640-0) dissected a disease-associated microglial (DAM-like) phenotype characterized by upregulation of lysosomal and vesicle trafficking genes (SQSTM1, CTSD, TREM2), partially overlapping with—but also distinct from—equivalent states in Alzheimer’s or multiple sclerosis. These findings highlight a shared framework in which microglia respond to neuronal stress with phagocytic and inflammatory signals, often modulated by disease-specific genetics and protein-aggregation contexts.

In multiple sclerosis (MS), microglial heterogeneity is perhaps even more pronounced, given the immune-driven demyelinating pathology. Early single-nucleus data (Jäkel S, Agirre E, Mendanha Falcão A, et al. "Altered human oligodendrocyte heterogeneity in multiple sclerosis." Nature. 2019 May 9;566(7745):543–547) identified microglia primarily as a distinct cluster but did not delve into subtypes. Subsequent investigations (Schirmer L, Velmeshev D, Holmqvist S, et al. Neuronal vulnerability and multilineage diversity in multiple sclerosis. Nature. 2019 Sep;573(7772):75-82. doi:10.1038/s41586-019-1404-z) revealed a rim-associated phagocytic microglial population that engulfs myelin transcripts and expresses complements (C1Q) and lipid-degradation genes (ASAH1, ACSL1). More spatially resolved analyses (Lerma-Martin C, Badia-i-Mompel P, Ramirez Flores RO, et al. "Cell type mapping reveals tissue niches and interactions in subcortical multiple sclerosis lesions." Nature Neuroscience, 2024. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-024-01796-z) emphasized chronic active lesion rims enriched for iron-handling and inflammatory microglia (CD163, FTL, TRAF3, SPP1). Some of these subsets overlap with known DAM markers (APOE, GPNMB) but show niche-specific interactions with astrocytes and endothelial cells, implying microglial-driven compartmentalized inflammation in MS progression. These patterns align with the concept that microglia are essential participants in demyelination and lesion chronicity, either perpetuating or attempting to repair tissue damage. Similarly, single-cell work (Is et al. (2024). "Single-nucleus RNA-seq of human temporal cortex. Nature Communications") for AD primarily examined endothelial and astrocyte changes, leaving microglia seemingly unchanged, illustrating that not all cohorts replicate robust microglial activation signals.

Outside classic neurodegeneration, microglia also display disease-specific activation in conditions such as epilepsy and intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). An analysis of drug-refractory epilepsy resected tissue (Kumar P, Lim A, Hazirah SN, et al. Single-cell transcriptomics and surface epitope detection in human brain epileptic lesions identifies pro-inflammatory signaling. Nature Neuroscience. 2022 Jul;25(7):956-966. doi:10.1038/s41593-022-01095-5) reported extensive proinflammatory microglial subtypes with high levels of IL1B, TNF, MHC class II (HLA-DRA/DPB1), and low expression of homeostatic markers (P2RY12, CX3CR1), resembling multiple sclerosis-associated microglia. In intracerebral hemorrhage, single-cell sequencing of perihematomal edema revealed similarly rapid conversion of homeostatic microglia into proinflammatory or lipid-accumulating states, driven in part by an SPP1/osteopontin–CD44 axis that orchestrates microglia-monocyte communication (Zhang et al., 2024, Journal of Neuroinflammation). Other disease contexts yield variable findings. In major depressive disorder, microglia did not show significant transcriptomic alterations (Nagy C, Maitra M, Tanti A, et al. (2020). Single-nucleus transcriptomics of the prefrontal cortex in major depressive disorder implicates oligodendrocyte precursor cells and excitatory neurons. Nature Neuroscience, 23(6):771–781), a negative result that may reflect technical constraints or subtle region-specific changes. Similarly, single-nucleus studies of schizophrenia either excluded microglia or found limited transcriptional differences (Batiuk MY, Tyler T, Dragicevic K, et al. "Upper cortical layer–driven network impairment in schizophrenia." Science Advances. 2022 Oct 12;8(41):eabn8367; Reiner B, Crist R, Stein L, et al. (2021). "Single-nuclei transcriptomics of schizophrenia prefrontal cortex primarily implicates neuronal subtypes." European Neuropsychopharmacology 51:e146–e193). Alcohol dependence analyses, such as that by Brenner E, Tiwari GR, Kapoor M, et al. (2020). "Single cell transcriptome profiling of the human alcohol-dependent brain." Human Molecular Genetics, 29(7):1144–1153, did detect microglial gene changes (e.g., TLR2 upregulation) but no major subtype expansions. Some lines of research (Page CE, Biagiotti SW, Alderman PJ, Sorrells SF. (2022). "Immature excitatory neurons in the amygdala come of age during puberty." Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience, 56:101133) have mentioned microglia only in passing, acknowledging their presence but not investigating subtype or activation status. Large cross-disorder atlases (Emani PS, Liu JJ, Clarke D, Jensen M, Warrell J, et al. (PsychENCODE Consortium). "Single-cell genomics and regulatory networks for 388 human brains." Science 384, eadi5199 (2024)) emphasize microglial gene regulatory networks, disease-specific eQTLs, and altered microglia-neuron interactions in disorders such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder, yet do not detect discrete microglial subpopulations akin to DAM. Another extensive dataset (Lee D et al., medRxiv 2024.10.31.24316513) similarly highlights microglial transitions in AD but finds less robust shifts in other pathologies.

Overall, these studies reveal that microglial diversity arises from both developmental programs and disease-related triggers, with subtypes converging on shared hallmarks—phagocytosis, lipid handling, inflammation, or antigen presentation—across neurodegeneration, autoimmunity, or acute injury. Disease-specific signatures, including TREM2-related pathways in AD, LRRK2 or endolysosomal changes in PD, and iron metabolism at MS lesion rims, underscore the interplay between genetic risk and microenvironmental cues. While many disorders feature a shift from homeostatic microglia (P2RY12+, CX3CR1+) toward DAM-like, proinflammatory, or phagocytic states, others—such as major depression or certain schizophrenia cohorts—show minimal or unremarkable microglial alterations. Technical factors, such as sample region, disease stage, and glial isolation efficiency, may partly explain these discrepancies. Taken together, single-cell genomics has revealed that microglial subtypes are anything but uniform, displaying disease- and context-dependent activation profiles that promise novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for an array of CNS disorders.
