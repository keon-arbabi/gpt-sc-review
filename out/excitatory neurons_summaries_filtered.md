Disease focus: Aging and Parkinson’s disease (PD) in the human midbrain (substantia nigra)
</metadata>

<methods>
This study performed paired single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and single-nucleus ATAC-seq (chromatin accessibility) on postmortem human substantia nigra from three groups: young controls (mean age 24), aged controls (mean age 75), and PD patients (mean age 81). The multiomic approach allowed simultaneous profiling of gene expression and chromatin accessibility in the same nuclei. Cell types were annotated using canonical markers, and pseudotime/pseudopathogenesis trajectories were constructed to model aging and disease progression. Validation included RNA-FISH for selected genes.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Identification**
Excitatory neurons (Ns) were identified using canonical markers (e.g., STMN2, SLC17A7/vGLUT1, SLC17A6/vGLUT2, TBR1). However, neurons were a minority cell type in the midbrain samples, with oligodendrocytes (ODCs) being the most abundant. The study notes that neuronal nuclei were underrepresented, likely due to technical limitations in nuclear isolation and increased sensitivity of neurons to permeabilization protocols. <keyFinding priority='3'>Excitatory neurons comprised a small fraction of total nuclei, limiting the depth of subtype analysis for this cell type.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization**
The study does not report detailed subclustering or functional heterogeneity within excitatory neurons. The main focus of cell subtype analysis and pseudopathogenesis trajectories was on glial populations (ODCs, microglia, astrocytes), where multiple subtypes and disease-associated states were identified and characterized. For neurons, only broad annotation was performed, and no distinct disease- or age-associated neuronal subtypes or states were described. <keyFinding priority='3'>No distinct excitatory neuron subtypes or disease-associated neuronal states were identified or characterized in this dataset.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**
The study does not highlight any significant differential gene expression, pathway enrichment, or regulatory network changes specifically within excitatory neurons across aging or PD.

**Peak–Gene Associations and Genetic Risk**
A notable observation is that some PD-associated GWAS SNPs (e.g., in the PINK1 locus) were found in ATAC peaks accessible in neurons, but the functional consequences or gene regulatory changes in excitatory neurons were not explored in detail. <keyFinding priority='2'>PD-associated SNPs were present in neuron-specific accessible chromatin regions (e.g., PINK1 locus), but their regulatory impact in excitatory neurons was not functionally characterized.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Spatial/Morphological Validation**
No spatial or morphological validation (e.g., immunostaining, in situ hybridization) was performed for excitatory neuron subtypes or states, as the focus was on glial validation.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**
Pseudopathogenesis and trajectory analyses were not performed for excitatory neurons due to their low abundance and lack of substructure in clustering. The main trajectory analyses were applied to ODCs, microglia, and astrocytes.

**Modulators & Metrics**
No quantitative changes in excitatory neuron proportions, activation scores, or morphology metrics were reported across age or PD status.

**Gene Regulatory Networks and Cell-Cell Communication**
No findings were reported regarding gene regulatory networks, transcription factors, or ligand-receptor interactions specific to excitatory neurons.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**
Although some neuron-specific ATAC peaks overlapped with PD GWAS SNPs, the study did not link these to functional changes in excitatory neurons.

**Quick Reference**

This multiomic single-nucleus study of the human midbrain found that excitatory neurons were a minor population and did not display significant age- or Parkinson’s disease–associated changes in gene expression, chromatin accessibility, or subpopulation structure. No distinct excitatory neuron subtypes or disease-associated states were identified, and the main findings centered on glial cell alterations. Some PD GWAS SNPs overlapped with neuron-specific accessible chromatin, but their functional impact was not explored.

**Research Implications**

This study highlights a technical limitation in current single-nucleus multiomic approaches for the human midbrain: excitatory neurons are underrepresented, likely due to their increased sensitivity to nuclear isolation protocols. As a result, the dataset does not support detailed analysis of excitatory neuron heterogeneity, subtypes, or disease-associated states in aging or PD. The absence of significant findings for excitatory neurons contrasts with the robust glial cell subtype and trajectory analyses presented. The presence of PD-associated GWAS SNPs in neuron-specific accessible chromatin regions suggests potential regulatory relevance, but functional consequences remain unexplored. Future studies should optimize nuclear isolation protocols to better capture neuronal populations and enable comprehensive analysis of neuronal subtypes and their roles in neurodegeneration. The lack of excitatory neuron findings in this study is consistent with the authors’ explicit discussion of technical limitations and does not contradict prior literature, but underscores the need for improved methodologies to resolve neuronal contributions to PD pathogenesis.

Al-Dalahmah O, Sosunov AA, Shaik A, Ofori K, Liu Y, Vonsattel JP, Adorjan I, Menon V, Goldman JE. (2020). "Single-nucleus RNA-seq identifies Huntington disease astrocyte states." Acta Neuropathologica Communications 8:19. https://doi.org/10.1186/s40478-020-0880-6
Disease focus: Huntington Disease (HD)
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on postmortem anterior cingulate cortex from grade III/IV HD patients and non-neurological controls. Nuclei were isolated from frozen tissue, processed using the 10x Genomics Chromium platform, and sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq. Cell types were identified and classified using unsupervised clustering and supervised gene set enrichment. Sub-clustering of major cell types, including neurons, was performed using SC3 consensus clustering. Validation included immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and qPCR.
</methods>

<quickReference>
Excitatory neurons in the HD cingulate cortex show a marked loss in cell number and downregulation of key neuronal genes, with distinct transcriptional signatures separating HD from control neurons. HD excitatory neurons upregulate stress-response and metallothionein genes, and their vulnerability is linked to cortical layer and disease severity. <keyFinding priority='1'>Excitatory neuron loss and dysfunction are prominent in HD cortex, with transcriptional changes strongly associated with disease status.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
</quickReference>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Morphology:**  
Excitatory neurons (large pyramidal neurons) are significantly depleted in the HD cingulate cortex, as confirmed by both snRNA-seq and histopathological quantification. Quantitative analysis of nuclear area distributions shows a reduction in large nuclei (neuronal) and an increase in small nuclei (glial), consistent with neuronal loss. <keyFinding priority='1'>Loss of excitatory neurons is a robust and validated feature of HD cortex.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
The study does not provide a detailed breakdown of excitatory neuron subtypes by molecular markers, but tSNE and clustering analyses reveal that excitatory neurons from HD and control brains form largely separate clusters, indicating disease-specific transcriptional states.  
- In control cortex, excitatory neurons express high levels of canonical markers (e.g., SLC17A7/VGLUT1, SLC17A6/VGLUT2, CAMK2A, MAP2, NEUN/RBFOX3).
- In HD cortex, these markers are downregulated, and there is upregulation of stress-response genes (e.g., metallothioneins MT1G, MT2A, MT1F), heat shock proteins, and genes involved in protein misfolding and cellular stress pathways. <keyFinding priority='2'>HD excitatory neurons exhibit a shift toward stress-response and protein homeostasis gene expression.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression:**  
Bulk RNA-seq and snRNA-seq both show that genes associated with glutamatergic neurotransmission (e.g., SLC17A7, SLC17A6), synaptic function, and neuronal identity are significantly downregulated in HD. Pathways related to glutamate, GABA, and neuropeptide Y neurotransmission are suppressed.  
- Upregulated genes in HD neurons include metallothioneins (MT1G, MT2A, MT1F), heat shock proteins, and genes involved in the unfolded protein response and oxidative stress.
- Downregulated genes include those involved in synaptic transmission, calcium signaling, and neuronal differentiation.

**Pathway Enrichment:**  
Gene ontology and Reactome analyses highlight:
- Downregulation: Synaptic transmission, neurotransmitter transport, calcium signaling, and neuronal differentiation.
- Upregulation: Metal ion binding, heat shock protein binding, unfolded protein response, and cellular stress pathways.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
The study notes that neuronal loss and dysfunction are most pronounced in cortical layers V and VI, which are especially vulnerable in HD. There is no explicit pseudotime or trajectory analysis, but the spatial pattern of loss is consistent with known disease progression.

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
No explicit analysis of genetic or demographic modifiers (e.g., CAG repeat length, sex, age) on excitatory neuron states is presented, but the study focuses on grade III/IV HD, representing an intermediate disease stage.

**Validation:**  
Neuronal loss is validated by histological staining (Cresyl violet, H&E) and quantification of nuclear size distributions. In situ hybridization confirms downregulation of neuronal markers in HD cortex.

**Gene Regulatory Networks:**  
No specific transcription factors or regulatory networks are highlighted for excitatory neurons, but the upregulation of stress-response genes suggests activation of general stress pathways.

**Cell-Cell Communication:**  
No direct ligand-receptor or cross-talk analysis is reported for excitatory neurons.

**Spatial Analysis:**  
Loss of large neurons is most evident in layers V and VI of the cingulate cortex, as shown by histology and supported by snRNA-seq data.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
No eQTL or GWAS integration is performed for excitatory neuron subtypes.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
Excitatory neuron loss and dysfunction are central to HD cortical pathology, contributing to cognitive and motor deficits. The marked downregulation of glutamatergic and synaptic genes, along with upregulation of stress-response pathways, suggests that excitatory neurons are both lost and functionally compromised in HD. These changes may be both a cause and consequence of astrocytic and glial reactivity. The findings reinforce the importance of neuronal vulnerability in disease progression and highlight potential biomarkers (e.g., metallothioneins, heat shock proteins) for neuronal stress in HD. <keyFinding priority='1'>Excitatory neuron degeneration is a key driver of clinical symptoms in HD cortex.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
</clinical>

<researchImplications>
This study demonstrates that excitatory neuron loss and transcriptional reprogramming are prominent in the HD cingulate cortex, with strong evidence for downregulation of neuronal identity and synaptic function genes, and upregulation of stress-response pathways. The lack of detailed molecular subtyping of excitatory neurons is a limitation; future work should resolve whether specific excitatory neuron subpopulations (e.g., by cortical layer or projection type) are differentially vulnerable. The findings align with prior knowledge of selective vulnerability in HD cortex but provide single-nucleus resolution and validation. Open questions include the temporal sequence of neuronal loss versus glial activation, the role of genetic modifiers, and whether stress-response gene upregulation is protective or maladaptive. No explicit contradictions with prior models are discussed by the authors. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Detailed Summary (≈800–1000 words):**

<findings>
The study provides a comprehensive single-nucleus transcriptomic and spatial analysis of excitatory neuron diversity and disease association in the DLPFC of schizophrenia patients. Excitatory neurons (principal neurons) were classified into 15 transcriptomic subtypes, with a focus on their laminar distribution and disease associations.

**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype-Specific Changes:**
Compositional analysis revealed a robust and statistically significant increase in the proportion of upper-layer excitatory neuron subtypes in schizophrenia, most notably within the L2_3_CUX2 family and the L4_5_FEZF2_LRRK1 subtype. This was consistently observed across snRNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq data from the CommonMind Consortium. The increase was most pronounced in L2_3_CUX2 subtypes, which are predicted to reside in cortical layers 2 and 3, and in L4_5_FEZF2_LRRK1, which spans layers 4 and 5. These findings were validated by spatial transcriptomics, which confirmed the enrichment of these subtypes in upper cortical layers in schizophrenia samples.
<keyFinding priority='1'>

**Subtype Characterization:**
- **L2_3_CUX2 Family:** Includes several subtypes such as L2_3_CUX2_FREM3_SV2C, L2_3_CUX2_FREM3_UNC5D, L2_3_CUX2_LAMP5_PDGFD, and L2_3_CUX2_LAMP5_MARCH1. These subtypes are defined by high expression of CUX2, FREM3, and LAMP5, with additional markers such as SV2C, UNCD5, PDGFD, and MARCH1 distinguishing individual subtypes. They are localized to layers 2 and 3 and are associated with increased abundance in schizophrenia.
- **L4_5_FEZF2_LRRK1:** Defined by high FEZF2 and LRRK1 expression, this subtype is localized to layers 4 and 5 and also shows increased abundance in schizophrenia.
<keyFinding priority='2'>
Each upper-layer excitatory neuron subtype is defined by a unique combination of marker genes (e.g., CUX2, FREM3, LAMP5, FEZF2, LRRK1), with disease-associated subtypes showing the most pronounced compositional and transcriptomic changes.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment:**
Across upper-layer excitatory neuron subtypes, schizophrenia was associated with:
- **Upregulation** of genes involved in neurotransmission, synaptic plasticity, and developmental processes.
- **Downregulation** of genes related to energy metabolism (notably mitochondrial ATP synthesis) and protein biogenesis.
Gene ontology (GO) analysis highlighted that the most significant downregulated pathways were related to mitochondrial function and protein synthesis, while upregulated pathways included synaptic signaling and neurodevelopmental processes.

**Subtype-Specific Disease Associations:**
- **L2_3_CUX2_LAMP5_PDGFD**: This subtype not only increased in abundance but also showed the strongest enrichment for schizophrenia GWAS risk genes, as determined by linkage disequilibrium score regression (CELLECT analysis). This suggests a direct genetic contribution to its disease association.
- **Other L2_3_CUX2 subtypes** (e.g., FREM3_SV2C, FREM3_UNC5D, LAMP5_MARCH1) also showed significant transcriptomic shifts, but the GWAS enrichment was most pronounced for LAMP5_PDGFD.

**Morphological and Spatial Validation:**
Spatial transcriptomics (Visium) confirmed the preferential localization of these subtypes to upper cortical layers and validated their increased abundance in schizophrenia. Immunohistochemistry for principal neuron markers (SMI31.1) did not show a significant change in total principal neuron density, suggesting that the observed compositional shifts reflect subtype redistribution rather than overall neuron loss.

Transcription factor network analysis identified several regulators (e.g., TCF4, ASCL1, PRDM14) as being differentially enriched in upper-layer excitatory neuron subtypes in schizophrenia. These factors are known to be involved in neurodevelopment and have been implicated in schizophrenia risk by GWAS.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories and Interindividual Variability:**
Schizophrenia samples showed greater interindividual transcriptomic variability among excitatory neuron subtypes, consistent with the clinical heterogeneity of the disorder. No significant effects of age, sex, or postmortem interval were detected on the main findings.

</findings>

<clinical>
The study implicates upper-layer excitatory neuron subtypes, especially L2_3_CUX2 and L4_5_FEZF2_LRRK1, as central players in the cortical network dysfunction of schizophrenia. The L2_3_CUX2_LAMP5_PDGFD subtype is genetically linked to disease risk, suggesting that developmental and synaptic dysregulation in these neurons may contribute to core symptoms. The coordinated upregulation of neurotransmission and downregulation of metabolic pathways points to a state of increased excitatory activity but impaired cellular homeostasis. These findings highlight upper-layer excitatory neuron subtypes as potential targets for therapeutic intervention and biomarker development, though causal relationships remain to be established.
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words):**

This study provides strong evidence that upper-layer excitatory neuron subtypes, particularly those defined by CUX2 and FEZF2 expression, are selectively increased and transcriptionally altered in schizophrenia. The identification of L2_3_CUX2_LAMP5_PDGFD as a GWAS-enriched, disease-associated subtype aligns with emerging models that emphasize the role of upper-layer cortical circuits in psychiatric disorders. The findings are consistent with, and extend, previous reports of upper-layer vulnerability in both schizophrenia and autism, suggesting a shared axis of cortical circuit pathology. Open questions include the developmental timing and mechanistic drivers of these changes, the functional consequences for cortical network activity, and the potential reversibility of these alterations. Future studies should address whether these subtype-specific changes are causal or compensatory, and whether they can be targeted therapeutically. The lack of significant total principal neuron loss suggests that interventions may need to focus on restoring subtype balance and function rather than preventing cell death. No explicit contradictions with prior models were discussed by the authors.

# summary for Brase 2021 (excitatory neurons)

**Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This large-scale snRNA-seq study of human parietal cortex in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) with diverse genetic backgrounds (APP, PSEN1, TREM2, MS4A, APOE) identified multiple excitatory neuron subtypes, each with distinct transcriptional signatures. Excitatory neuron subclusters (Neuro.0, Neuro.1, Neuro.2, Neuro.6) showed the highest average number of differentially expressed genes among all cell types. Notably, autosomal dominant AD (ADAD, APP/PSEN1 mutation carriers) brains exhibited a reduced proportion of excitatory neurons and unique disease-associated transcriptional states, with some subtypes showing strong co-expression of APOE and MHC-I, particularly in advanced disease and in association with genetic risk factors such as APOE ε4. <keyFinding priority='1'>Excitatory neuron vulnerability and subtype-specific transcriptional changes are strongly associated with ADAD genotype and disease progression.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>

</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on 294,114 nuclei from the parietal cortex (Brodmann areas 1–3, 7) of 67 postmortem human brains, enriched for carriers of AD pathogenic mutations (APP, PSEN1), TREM2 risk variants, and the MS4A resilience variant (rs1582763), as well as APOE ε4. Deep subclustering and differential expression analyses were conducted for each major cell type, with validation in ROSMAP (DLPFC) and 5xFAD mouse models.
</methods>

<findings>
The study identified 15 major cell-type clusters, with neurons (excitatory and inhibitory) comprising 18.1% of nuclei. Excitatory neurons were further subclustered into four main subtypes (Neuro.0, Neuro.1, Neuro.2, Neuro.6), each defined by unique transcriptional signatures and marker gene expression. The highest average number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) was observed in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, likely reflecting their laminar diversity.

**Cell Type Proportions:**  
A reduced proportion of excitatory neurons was previously observed in ADAD (PSEN1 mutation) compared to sAD and controls, a finding consistent with the current expanded cohort. <keyFinding priority='1'>Excitatory neuron loss or reduction is a hallmark of ADAD parietal cortex.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
Excitatory neuron subclusters (Neuro.0, Neuro.1, Neuro.2, Neuro.6) were identified, each with distinct marker genes (not all markers are specified in the main text, but subclusters are referenced in Figure 5 and Table 3). These subtypes likely correspond to different cortical layers or functional states, as suggested by prior studies and the high DEG counts.

- **Neuro.0, Neuro.1, Neuro.2, Neuro.6:**  
  These subtypes represent excitatory neurons with varying transcriptional profiles. The study does not provide exhaustive marker lists for each, but notes that all excitatory subtypes showed substantial transcriptional heterogeneity and were included in analyses of APOE and MHC-I co-expression.

**Differential Gene Expression & Pathways:**  
Excitatory neuron subtypes exhibited thousands of DEGs, with pathway enrichment analyses indicating upregulation of cytoplasmic translation and other neuronal processes in APOE ε4 carriers. <keyFinding priority='2'>APOE ε4 carriers showed upregulation of cytoplasmic translation in excitatory neurons.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Disease-Associated States & Trajectories:**  
A key finding was the dynamic change in the proportion of "APOE-high" excitatory neurons across disease stages. In controls, ~20% of neurons were APOE-high, rising sharply to 69% in presymptomatic AD, then falling to 5.7% in sAD and 3.4% in ADAD. This suggests that APOE-high excitatory neurons are selectively vulnerable and lost as disease progresses. <keyFinding priority='1'>Excitatory neurons with high APOE expression are transiently increased before clinical onset, then depleted in symptomatic AD, indicating selective vulnerability.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**APOE and MHC-I Co-expression:**  
Co-expression of APOE and MHC-I was observed in both inhibitory and excitatory neuron subtypes, but in ADAD, all neuronal subtypes (including excitatory) showed strong correlation. This co-expression is proposed to "tag" neurons for removal, consistent with prior reports. <keyFinding priority='2'>APOE/MHC-I co-expression in excitatory neurons is prominent in ADAD and may mediate selective neurodegeneration.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
Genetic background (APP/PSEN1 mutations, APOE ε4) and disease stage modulate excitatory neuron vulnerability and transcriptional state. The study does not report significant effects of TREM2 or MS4A variants on excitatory neuron subtypes.

**Spatial/Morphological Validation:**  
No direct spatial or morphological validation (e.g., immunostaining) of excitatory neuron subtypes is reported, but the findings are supported by cross-cohort replication and integration with mouse models.

**Gene Regulatory Networks & Cell-Cell Communication:**  
While not detailed for excitatory neurons, the study notes that upregulated genes in APOE-high neurons are enriched for cytokine response pathways, suggesting possible microglia-neuron cross-talk.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
The temporal pattern of APOE-high neuron abundance (rise in presymptomatic, fall in symptomatic AD) supports a model in which excitatory neurons are progressively lost as pathology advances, with ADAD showing the most pronounced changes.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
The study integrates GWAS data, showing that some AD risk genes (e.g., SORL1, PLCG2) are expressed in excitatory neurons, but does not identify subtype-specific genetic associations for excitatory neurons.

Excitatory neurons in the parietal cortex are highly vulnerable in ADAD, with selective loss and profound transcriptional changes preceding and accompanying clinical onset. The transient increase and subsequent depletion of APOE-high excitatory neurons, along with their co-expression of MHC-I, suggest a mechanism for selective neurodegeneration potentially mediated by immune signaling. These findings highlight excitatory neuron subtypes as potential early biomarkers and therapeutic targets in AD, especially in genetically defined populations. However, causal relationships remain associative, and further functional validation is needed.

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study provides a detailed atlas of excitatory neuron heterogeneity in the human parietal cortex in AD, revealing dynamic, subtype-specific transcriptional changes linked to genetic risk and disease progression. The identification of transient APOE-high excitatory neuron states and their co-expression with MHC-I supports a model of immune-mediated neuronal vulnerability, aligning with but also extending prior findings. Open questions include the precise molecular triggers for APOE/MHC-I upregulation, the functional roles of each excitatory neuron subtype, and whether similar patterns are observed in other cortical regions or in earlier disease stages. The lack of direct spatial or morphological validation for excitatory neuron subtypes is a limitation, as is the reliance on cross-sectional data for temporal inferences. Future studies should integrate spatial transcriptomics, functional assays, and longitudinal sampling to clarify the causal pathways leading to excitatory neuron loss in AD. The findings are broadly consistent with known models of selective neuronal vulnerability but provide new granularity regarding genetic modulation and cell-state transitions. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD), including autosomal dominant (ADAD), sporadic (sAD), and genetic risk/resilience variant carriers (APOE, TREM2, MS4A).
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) was performed on ~300,000 nuclei from the parietal cortex (Brodmann areas 7 and 39) of 67 individuals, including ADAD (APP/PSEN1), sAD, presymptomatic, other neurodegenerative, and control cases. Subclustering and differential expression analyses were performed for each major cell type, including excitatory neurons. Replication was performed using DLPFC (ROSMAP) and prefrontal cortex (UCI MIND ADRC) datasets.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and General Trends**  
Excitatory neurons comprised a substantial fraction of the neuronal nuclei analyzed. Across AD groups, there was a trend toward overall transcriptional underexpression in excitatory neurons, suggesting a general loss of function in disease states <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>.

**Excitatory Neuron Subtypes and States**  
The study identified multiple excitatory neuron (EN) subclusters (cell states), each defined by distinct transcriptional signatures. The precise number and naming of EN subtypes are not detailed in the main text, but subclustering revealed 5–9 transcriptional states per major cell type, including excitatory neurons.

- **Subtype Characterization**:  
  - Subtypes were classified based on canonical markers (e.g., SLC17A7, NRGN, CAMK2A) and further annotated by layer-specific markers (from Lake et al.).
  - Each EN subtype exhibited a unique set of upregulated genes (average ~2,696 per state), indicating high transcriptional diversity.

- **Disease-Associated Subtypes**:  
  - Certain EN subtypes were enriched in ADAD carriers, as shown in Figure 3c, though the specific subtype labels (e.g., EN.3) are not explicitly named in the main text.
  - These ADAD-enriched EN subtypes displayed upregulation of genes involved in cholesterol homeostasis (EHD1, DGAT2, LRP5, LDLRAP1; Benjamini–Hochberg p = 3.99 × 10⁻²) <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>.
  - The gene SNTG, associated with age of onset in PSEN1 p.E280A carriers, was dysregulated in excitatory neurons of both ADAD and APOEε4+ samples <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>.

- **Functional Signatures**:  
  - EN subtypes in ADAD and sAD showed overexpression of genes related to cholesterol/lipid metabolism, suggesting altered neuronal lipid handling in AD <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>.
  - Pathway analysis highlighted enrichment for cholesterol homeostasis and vesicle-mediated transport in EN subtypes from ADAD brains.

- **APOEε4 Effects**:  
  - Inhibitory neuron (IN) subtypes, but not EN, showed a ferroptosis signature in APOEε4 carriers. However, SNTG dysregulation in EN was also observed in APOEε4+ samples, suggesting some overlap in vulnerability pathways <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>.

- **Temporal/Spatial Context**:  
  - The study suggests that EN subtypes enriched in ADAD may represent accelerated or advanced disease states, as the parietal cortex is affected later in sAD but earlier in ADAD <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>.

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathways**  
- Across AD groups, excitatory neurons showed underexpression of many genes, consistent with loss of function.
- Shared upregulation of cholesterol homeostasis genes (EHD1, DGAT2, LRP5, LDLRAP1) in EN across AD groups.
- SNTG dysregulation in EN of ADAD and APOEε4+ samples.
- Pathway enrichment for vesicle-mediated transport and cholesterol metabolism in EN subtypes from ADAD.

**Genetic Modifiers and GWAS Integration**  
- The study mapped GWAS risk loci to cell types and found that the NCK2 locus, previously linked to microglia, also showed the largest expression differences in excitatory neuron subtypes. Chromatin accessibility data (snATAC-seq) revealed that the NCK2 promoter is co-accessible with risk variants in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, but not microglia <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>.

**Validation**  
- Findings were replicated in independent DLPFC and prefrontal cortex datasets, with high concordance in cell-type-specific gene expression and differential expression patterns.

**Contradictions**  
- The authors do not explicitly discuss contradictions with prior models for excitatory neurons; all major findings are presented as novel or confirmatory <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>.
</findings>

<clinical>
Excitatory neuron subtypes in the parietal cortex display distinct transcriptional states in AD, with ADAD and APOEε4+ carriers showing enrichment for subtypes with altered cholesterol metabolism and SNTG dysregulation. These changes may contribute to synaptic dysfunction and neuronal vulnerability in AD, though causality is not established. The mapping of GWAS risk loci (e.g., NCK2) to excitatory neurons suggests that neuronal subtypes may mediate genetic risk previously attributed to glia, highlighting the importance of neuronal lipid handling and vesicle transport pathways as potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers. However, these associations are cross-sectional and require further functional validation.

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**  
This study used snRNA-seq of parietal cortex to reveal multiple excitatory neuron (EN) subtypes, with certain subtypes enriched in autosomal dominant AD (ADAD) and APOEε4+ carriers. These disease-associated EN subtypes are defined by upregulation of cholesterol homeostasis genes (EHD1, DGAT2, LRP5, LDLRAP1) and dysregulation of SNTG. Notably, the NCK2 AD GWAS locus, previously linked to microglia, shows its strongest expression differences in EN subtypes, with chromatin accessibility supporting a neuronal effector role. These findings suggest that genetic risk and disease mechanisms in AD converge on specific excitatory neuron states, particularly in the context of lipid metabolism.

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words):**

This study highlights the transcriptional heterogeneity of excitatory neurons in the AD parietal cortex, revealing disease- and genotype-associated subtypes with altered cholesterol metabolism and vesicle transport. The identification of SNTG dysregulation and the mapping of the NCK2 GWAS locus to excitatory neurons challenge the prevailing glia-centric view of AD genetic risk, suggesting that neuronal subtypes may be direct effectors of certain risk variants. Open questions include the precise functional consequences of these EN subtypes, their temporal dynamics during disease progression, and their relationship to synaptic loss and cognitive decline. The findings align with emerging models that emphasize neuronal lipid metabolism in AD, but also extend these by providing cell-state resolution and genetic context. Further studies are needed to validate the causal role of these EN subtypes in AD pathogenesis, to determine their utility as biomarkers, and to explore whether targeting neuronal cholesterol handling could offer therapeutic benefit. No explicit conflicts with prior models are discussed by the authors, but the data suggest a need to reconsider the cellular targets of some AD risk loci.

# summary for Brenner 2020 (excitatory neurons)

**Quick Reference (Excitatory Neurons):**

This study used snRNA-seq to profile the human prefrontal cortex in alcohol-dependent and control individuals, identifying excitatory neurons as a major cell type but finding only a modest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in this population compared to glia. No distinct excitatory neuron subtypes or disease-associated states were reported; instead, excitatory neurons showed cell type-enriched expression of genes such as SNCA and SLC17A7, with limited alcohol-associated transcriptional changes and no significant modulation by demographic or genetic factors. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Detailed Summary**

<metadata>
Brenner E, Tiwari GR, Kapoor M, Liu Y, Brock A, Mayfield RD. "Single cell transcriptome profiling of the human alcohol-dependent brain." Human Molecular Genetics. 2020;29(7):1144–1153. doi:10.1093/hmg/ddaa038  
Disease focus: Alcohol dependence (alcoholism)
</metadata>

<methods>
The authors performed single nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on 16,305 nuclei from frozen postmortem prefrontal cortex (PFC) tissue of seven donors (four controls, three alcohol-dependent). Droplet-based snRNA-seq was used, and nuclei were clustered and annotated into seven major brain cell types using canonical marker genes. Differential expression was assessed using a pseudo-bulk approach (DESeq2), with batch as a covariate. No subclustering was performed within excitatory neurons, as the study focused on established cell types rather than novel subtypes.  
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Excitatory neurons were the most abundant cell type in the dataset, consistent with prior snRNA-seq studies of human cortex. The proportion of excitatory neurons did not differ significantly between alcohol-dependent and control groups, indicating no major loss or expansion of this population in alcoholism. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
The study did not report further subclustering or identification of distinct excitatory neuron subtypes or states. All excitatory neurons were grouped as a single cluster, defined by high expression of canonical markers such as SLC17A7 (VGLUT1), SATB2, and CAMK2A (see Figure 1C/E). No disease-associated or homeostatic subpopulations within excitatory neurons were described. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression:**  
Excitatory neurons exhibited a relatively small number of DEGs between alcohol-dependent and control donors (see Figure 3A/B). The volcano plot (Figure 3B) shows only a handful of significant DEGs (FDR < 0.05), with most not previously implicated in alcohol dependence. Notably, the top DEGs in excitatory neurons included non-coding RNAs (e.g., AC079793.1) and protein-coding genes such as HERC2P9 and APOC4-APOC2. The direction and magnitude of these changes were not highlighted as functionally significant by the authors. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Pathway Enrichment:**  
No major pathways were significantly enriched among DEGs in excitatory neurons. In contrast, glial cell types (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia) showed more robust pathway-level changes. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Neuroimmune/Inflammatory Genes:**  
Excitatory neurons showed cell type-enriched expression of SNCA (alpha-synuclein), as well as moderate expression of neuroimmune genes such as HMGB1 and FZD1 (see Figure 2A). However, these genes did not show significant differential expression in alcoholism within excitatory neurons. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
No significant effects of demographic (age, sex) or genetic (GWAS risk) factors on excitatory neuron gene expression were reported. GWAS enrichment analysis did not implicate excitatory neurons in alcohol dependence risk, in contrast to astrocytes. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Spatial/Morphological Validation:**  
No spatial or morphological validation (e.g., immunostaining) was performed for excitatory neuron subpopulations or DEGs. <keyFinding priority='3'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
No pseudotime or trajectory analysis was performed for excitatory neurons, and no evidence for disease stage-specific transitions or activation states was presented. <keyFinding priority='3'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Gene Regulatory Networks & Cell-Cell Communication:**  
No specific gene regulatory networks or ligand-receptor interactions involving excitatory neurons were highlighted. <keyFinding priority='3'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Comparison with Bulk Data:**  
Excitatory neuron DEGs showed moderate similarity to bulk RNA-seq findings, but the overlap was limited and less pronounced than for glial cell types. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Summary:**  
Overall, excitatory neurons in the alcoholic human PFC did not display major transcriptional reprogramming or the emergence of disease-associated subtypes. The most notable features were the preservation of canonical marker expression and the lack of significant cell type proportion or pathway-level changes in alcoholism. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
Excitatory neurons, while abundant and transcriptionally distinct, did not show strong disease-associated changes in gene expression or subpopulation structure in alcohol dependence. The findings suggest that, at least in the PFC and at the resolution of this study, excitatory neurons may not be the primary mediators of alcohol-induced transcriptomic pathology, in contrast to glial cells. There is no evidence from this study to support excitatory neuron-specific therapeutic targeting or biomarker development in alcoholism. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications**

This study highlights the relative transcriptional stability of excitatory neurons in the human alcoholic PFC, with no evidence for disease-associated subtypes or major pathway alterations. The absence of significant findings may reflect true biological resilience, limitations of sample size, or the lack of subclustering resolution. Future research should consider deeper subclustering of excitatory neurons, spatial transcriptomics, or integration with electrophysiological and morphological data to uncover subtle or region-specific changes. The results align with prior bulk and single-cell studies suggesting glial cells are more dynamically altered in neuropsychiatric disease, but do not contradict established excitatory neuron classification schemes. Open questions remain regarding potential vulnerability of excitatory neuron subtypes in other brain regions or at different disease stages. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD), aging human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC)
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on DLPFC tissue from 24 individuals spanning a spectrum of cognitive and pathological AD states. This high-resolution cellular map was used to deconvolve cell-type and cell-subtype proportions in bulk RNA-seq data from 638 additional individuals using the CelMod algorithm. Spatial transcriptomics and immunohistochemistry were used for validation.
</methods>

<quickReference>
This study identified ten transcriptionally distinct excitatory neuron subtypes in the aging human DLPFC, each mapped to specific cortical layers and defined by unique marker genes (e.g., CUX2, RORB, FEZF2). While no single excitatory subtype showed a robust, statistically significant change in proportion with AD after correction, middle/deep layer RORB+ excitatory neurons (Exc.3–6) were nominally reduced in AD and associated with β-amyloid pathology. These findings were validated across a large cohort and linked to cognitive decline, with layer-specific vulnerability emerging as a key feature.
</quickReference>

<findings>
The authors generated a high-resolution snRNA-seq atlas of the aging DLPFC, identifying ten excitatory neuron subtypes (Exc.1–Exc.10), each corresponding to specific cortical layers and expressing distinct marker genes. Subtype identities and characteristics are as follows:

- **Exc.1**: Layer 1/2–3, CUX2+; homeostatic, upper-layer marker.
- **Exc.2**: Layer 4, DCC+, RORB+; mid-layer marker.
- **Exc.3**: Layer 4–5, PLCH1+, RORB+; mid/deep-layer marker.
- **Exc.4**: Layer 4–5, TMSB10+, RORB+; mid/deep-layer marker.
- **Exc.5**: Layer 4, ADGRL4+, RORB+; mid-layer marker.
- **Exc.6**: Layer 5, HTR2C+, FEZF2+; deep-layer marker.
- **Exc.7**: Layer 6, THEMIS+; deep-layer marker.
- **Exc.8**: Layer 6, NFIA+, FEZF2+; deep-layer marker.
- **Exc.9**: Layer 6, TRPM3+, FEZF2+; deep-layer marker.
- **Exc.10**: Layer 6, RGS12+, THEMIS+; deep-layer marker.

These subtypes were validated by spatial transcriptomics, confirming their laminar localization in the DLPFC.

**Cell Type Proportions and Disease Association:**
- No excitatory neuron subtype showed a statistically significant change in proportion with AD after multiple testing correction in the snRNA-seq dataset alone (<confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>).
- However, in the larger deconvolved bulk RNA-seq cohort (n=638), there was a **nominal reduction in the proportion of middle/deep layer RORB+ excitatory neurons (Exc.3–6) in individuals with high β-amyloid pathology** and AD dementia (<keyFinding priority='2'>, <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).
- These subtypes (Exc.3–6) were negatively associated with β-amyloid burden, suggesting selective vulnerability of RORB+ pyramidal neurons in AD, consistent with prior reports (<keyFinding priority='1'>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).
- No strong evidence was found for changes in upper-layer (Exc.1, CUX2+) or deep-layer (Exc.7–10, FEZF2+) excitatory neuron subtypes in relation to AD pathology.

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathways:**
- Each excitatory neuron subtype was defined by unique marker genes (see above), but the study did not report broad disease-associated gene expression programs within excitatory neurons as a class.
- No major pathway enrichment or disease-associated transcriptional state was highlighted for excitatory neurons beyond their laminar and marker gene distinctions.

**Spatial and Morphological Validation:**
- Spatial transcriptomics (Visium) confirmed the laminar distribution of excitatory neuron markers (e.g., RORB, CUX2, TOX) in DLPFC slices, supporting the anatomical validity of the identified subtypes (<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>).

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**
- The study did not report pseudotime or trajectory analyses specifically for excitatory neurons, but the observed reduction in RORB+ subtypes with increasing amyloid pathology suggests a possible progression-related vulnerability.

**Modulators & Metrics:**
- No specific genetic (e.g., APOE) or demographic (age, sex) modulators of excitatory neuron subtypes were identified in this study.
- The main driver of excitatory neuron vulnerability appeared to be β-amyloid pathology, with less clear association to tau or cognitive decline after correction.

**Cell-Cell Communication and Communities:**
- Excitatory neuron subtypes, particularly those in layers 4–5, were part of a multicellular community negatively associated with β-amyloid burden, suggesting coordinated vulnerability with other cell types (e.g., Inh.6, PTPRK+ inhibitory neurons) (<keyFinding priority='2'>, <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>).

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
Excitatory neuron subtypes in the aging DLPFC show pronounced laminar and molecular heterogeneity. The study highlights a **selective vulnerability of middle/deep layer RORB+ excitatory neurons (Exc.3–6) to β-amyloid pathology and AD dementia**, consistent with their previously reported role in AD. This vulnerability may contribute to the loss of cortical connectivity and cognitive decline in AD, although the effect size is modest and not all subtypes are equally affected. The findings reinforce the importance of layer- and subtype-specific analyses for understanding neuronal loss in AD and suggest that preservation of RORB+ excitatory neurons could be a therapeutic target or biomarker for disease progression. However, causal claims are limited by the cross-sectional nature of the data.
</clinical>

<researchImplications>
This study provides a detailed molecular and spatial map of excitatory neuron diversity in the aging human DLPFC, confirming and extending previous reports of selective vulnerability of RORB+ (middle/deep layer) excitatory neurons in AD. The alignment of these subtypes with known laminar markers and their association with β-amyloid pathology supports the robustness of the classification scheme (<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>). Open questions remain regarding the mechanisms underlying the selective vulnerability of these subtypes, the potential role of tau pathology, and whether similar patterns are observed in other cortical regions. The lack of strong genetic or demographic modulators suggests that pathology-driven mechanisms predominate for excitatory neuron loss. Future studies should address longitudinal dynamics, causal mechanisms, and the interplay with other cell types in multicellular communities. No explicit contradictions with prior models were discussed by the authors.

# summary for Daskalakis 2024 (excitatory neurons)

<metadata>
Daskalakis NP, Iatrou A, Chatzinakos C, et al. "Systems biology dissection of PTSD and MDD across brain regions, cell types, and blood." Science. 384, eadh3707 (2024). DOI: 10.1126/science.adh3707
Disease focus: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD)
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) samples from 118 postmortem brains (PTSD, MDD, neurotypical controls). Bulk multiomic profiling (transcriptomics, methylomics, proteomics) was conducted across medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), dentate gyrus (DG), and central amygdala (CeA). snRNA-seq data were meta-analyzed across batches, with cell type and subtype annotation harmonized. Replication was performed in independent cohorts. Pathway, network, and genetic integration analyses were included.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions:**  
No significant differences in overall excitatory neuron (Ex) proportions were observed between PTSD, MDD, and controls in the dlPFC by snRNA-seq. Minor differences in other cell types (e.g., microglia, OPCs) were noted in MDD, but not for Ex neurons.

**Differential Gene Expression (DGE) in Excitatory Neurons:**  
In PTSD, 46 FDR-significant DEGs were identified in Ex neurons, representing 79% of all PTSD cell type–specific DEGs. In MDD, Ex neurons showed 217 FDR-significant DEGs (26% of all MDD cell type–specific DEGs), second only to astrocytes. The majority of these DEGs were unique to each disorder, with limited overlap.

**Subtype/State Characterization:**  
The study did not report further subdivision of Ex neurons into molecularly distinct subtypes beyond the broad Ex classification in the main text. However, cell subtype annotation was harmonized across batches, and Ex neurons were analyzed as a unified population for DGE and pathway analysis.

**Key Marker Genes and Functional Signatures:**  
- **PTSD Ex Neurons:**  
  - Upregulated: ARL17B (FDR < 4.6 × 10⁻⁹), LINC02210-CRHR1 fusion, CDH3, TAF1C, SLC16A6.
  - Downregulated: SRSF6 (alternative splicing regulator).
  - Functional signature: Upregulation of genes at the 17q21.31 locus (ARL17B, LINC02210-CRHR1), which is a PTSD GWAS locus. Pathways included stress response, synaptic regulation, and mitochondrial function.
  - Disease association: ARL17B and LINC02210-CRHR1 were both DEGs and genetically implicated risk genes for PTSD, with ARL17B showing consistent upregulation in both Ex neurons and astrocytes.
  - <keyFinding priority='1'>ARL17B and LINC02210-CRHR1 fusion are strongly upregulated in Ex neurons in PTSD, linking cell type–specific expression to a major PTSD risk locus.</keyFinding>

<clinical>
Excitatory neurons in the dlPFC show robust, cell type–specific transcriptomic dysregulation in both PTSD and MDD, with distinct molecular signatures. In PTSD, Ex neuron upregulation of ARL17B and LINC02210-CRHR1 links cell-intrinsic changes to a major genetic risk locus, suggesting a direct genetic contribution to neuronal stress responses. In MDD, Ex neuron upregulation of FKBP5 and STAT3 highlights a prominent glucocorticoid and stress-response axis, potentially mediating vulnerability to depressive pathology. The convergence on ribosomal and mitochondrial dysfunction in Ex neurons across both disorders suggests a shared neuronal stress phenotype, while divergence in immune and stress signaling points to disorder-specific mechanisms. The overlap of Ex neuron DEGs with blood biomarkers supports their translational relevance. These findings suggest that excitatory neuron dysfunction may contribute to cognitive and affective symptoms in PTSD and MDD, and that cell type–specific markers (e.g., ARL17B, FKBP5) could inform biomarker or therapeutic development, though causal or temporal relationships remain to be established.

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**  
Excitatory neurons in the dlPFC exhibit robust, cell type–specific transcriptomic changes in both PTSD and MDD. In PTSD, Ex neurons show strong upregulation of ARL17B and LINC02210-CRHR1, linking neuronal expression to the 17q21.31 PTSD risk locus. In MDD, Ex neurons upregulate FKBP5 and STAT3, highlighting a glucocorticoid-responsive stress signature. Both disorders show convergent downregulation of ribosomal and mitochondrial pathways in Ex neurons. Notably, ARL17B and FKBP5 are also dysregulated in blood, supporting their biomarker potential. Childhood trauma and genetic risk at 17q21.31 modulate Ex neuron signatures in PTSD.

**Research Implications (≈150 words):**  
This study provides strong evidence that excitatory neurons in the dlPFC are a key cellular substrate for molecular pathology in both PTSD and MDD, with distinct genetic and stress-response signatures. The identification of ARL17B and LINC02210-CRHR1 upregulation in PTSD Ex neurons directly links cell type–specific expression to a major GWAS locus, supporting a model where genetic risk is realized through neuronal stress pathways. In MDD, FKBP5 and STAT3 upregulation in Ex neurons underscores the importance of glucocorticoid signaling in depression. The convergence on ribosomal and mitochondrial dysfunction suggests a shared neuronal stress phenotype, while divergence in immune and stress signaling may underlie disorder-specific features. The overlap of Ex neuron DEGs with blood biomarkers highlights translational potential. Open questions include whether finer Ex neuron subtypes exist with distinct vulnerability, how these signatures evolve with disease progression, and whether targeting Ex neuron stress pathways could yield therapeutic benefit. No explicit conflicts with prior Ex neuron models were discussed by the authors.

# summary for Davila-Velderrain 2021 (excitatory neurons)

**Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This study (Davila-Velderrain et al., 2021, bioRxiv) provides a single-nucleus RNA-seq atlas of the human hippocampus and entorhinal cortex across Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression, revealing 14 distinct excitatory (glutamatergic) neuron subpopulations mapped to anatomical subregions (e.g., CA1, CA3, DG, EC layers). Excitatory neurons, especially CA1 pyramidal cells, show the strongest and most subtype-specific transcriptional alterations in response to neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology, including upregulation of stress, apoptosis, and DNA damage pathways. These changes are stage-dependent and regionally specific, with CA1 and EC neurons being most vulnerable, and are not explained by age or sex.

Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
</metadata>

<methods>
This study employed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) using 10x Genomics v3 chemistry on postmortem hippocampus (HIP) and entorhinal cortex (EC) tissue from 65 aged individuals (31 AD, 34 controls), spanning early (Braak 3/4) and late (Braak 5/6) AD pathology. A total of 489,558 high-quality nuclei were analyzed. Cell type and neuronal subpopulation annotation was performed via graph-based clustering, cross-referenced with human and mouse spatial and single-cell transcriptomic datasets. Validation included cross-species transcriptomic comparisons and spatial mapping.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Heterogeneity**  
Excitatory neurons (glutamatergic) were robustly identified and further subdivided into 14 transcriptionally distinct subpopulations, each corresponding to major hippocampal and EC anatomical regions: dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells, CA1 and CA3 pyramidal neurons, subiculum, and multiple EC layers (ECL2-6), as well as smaller groups (e.g., area prostriata, Car3L6, CRmx). These subtypes were validated by strong correlation with mouse spatial transcriptomics and single-cell data, as well as human microdissected tissue, confirming that snRNA-seq captures fine anatomical cytoarchitecture. <keyFinding priority='1'>Excitatory neuron subtypes display strong region-specific transcriptional signatures, unlike GABAergic neurons or glia.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Subtype Characterization**  
Each excitatory neuron subtype was defined by unique marker gene sets and mapped to anatomical layers:
- **DG granule cells**: PROX1, LATS2, CTXND1, FN1.
- **CA1 pyramidal neurons**: CA1-specific markers (not explicitly listed in the main text, but validated by cross-species mapping).
- **CA3 pyramidal neurons**: CA3-specific markers.
- **EC layers (ECL2-6)**: Layer-specific markers, with subpopulations corresponding to superficial (L2/3), mid (L3/4/5), and deep (L6) layers.
- **Other subtypes**: Area prostriata (APr), Car3L6, and CRmx (mixed Cajal–Retzius/progenitor-like).

These subtypes were confirmed by both marker gene expression and spatial mapping, and their relative abundance was consistent across donors and pathology groups.

**Disease-Associated Changes**  
Excitatory neurons showed the largest number of neuropathology-associated genes among all cell types, with 2,495 genes showing significant expression changes in at least one comparison. Many of these genes are preferentially expressed in excitatory neurons, including AD risk genes (e.g., SORL1, BIN1, ADAM10, PARP1). <keyFinding priority='1'>CA1 pyramidal neurons are the most transcriptionally altered excitatory subtype in response to AD pathology, followed by EC deep and mid-layer neurons; CA3 and DG granule cells are least affected.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathways**  
NFT pathology induces highly subtype-specific transcriptional responses:
- **Upregulated in CA1 and EC L2/3 neurons**: Genes involved in actin cytoskeleton, endocytosis, ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis, stress response (e.g., PRKAR2A, IP6K2, LRRC4B, CHD3).
- **Downregulated in CA1 neurons**: Glutamatergic synaptic and calcium signaling genes, consistent with neurotransmission dysfunction.
- **Upregulated in CA1 neurons**: KEGG neurodegenerative disease pathways (AD, Huntington’s, Parkinson’s), insulin and chemokine signaling.
- **EC neurons**: Partial upregulation of glutamatergic and GABAergic synaptic genes in both superficial and deep layers; deep layers show downregulation of neurodegenerative disease pathways.

Gene ontology and pathway enrichment analyses revealed that NFT-responsive genes in excitatory neurons are enriched for cell-cell signaling, synaptic transmission, and stress response. <keyFinding priority='2'>Excitatory neuron NFT-responses are highly specific: 87.7% of NFT-responsive genes are altered in only one anatomical region/subtype.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Stage-Dependent and Regional Effects**  
Early-stage (Braak 3/4) changes in excitatory neurons involve upregulation of energy metabolism and mitochondrial genes (e.g., EGR1, COX6C, OXA1L), while late-stage (Braak 5/6) changes include upregulation of stress, apoptosis, and DNA damage genes (e.g., BIN1, CREB1, HDAC2, EGFR, NFKBIA, RHOA, SPP1). Synaptic signaling and neurotransmitter receptor genes (e.g., GRIN2A, GRM5/7, GABRA3, CHRNA7) are consistently downregulated in late-stage disease. <keyFinding priority='2'>Late-stage transcriptional responses in excitatory neurons converge with those observed in the prefrontal cortex, while early-stage responses are regionally distinct.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators & Metrics**  
No significant modulation by age or sex was observed for excitatory neuron subtype responses. The study did not report APOE genotype effects within excitatory neurons. Quantitative NFT burden was used to stratify neuronal subtype responses.

**Gene Regulatory Networks and Cell-Cell Communication**  
The study identified upregulation of stress and apoptosis-related transcriptional modules in excitatory neurons but did not detail specific transcription factors or ligand-receptor pairs for these subtypes.

**Spatial Analysis**  
Spatial mapping and cross-species validation confirmed that excitatory neuron subtypes correspond to anatomical layers and subregions, supporting the biological relevance of the identified transcriptional states.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**  
Pseudotime or trajectory analysis was not explicitly performed, but stage-dependent (early vs. late Braak) comparisons suggest a progression from metabolic and neurotransmission dysregulation to stress and apoptotic responses in excitatory neurons.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**  
Several AD GWAS risk genes (e.g., SORL1, BIN1, ADAM10) are differentially expressed in excitatory neurons, but the strongest GWAS-module associations were observed in oligodendrocyte lineage cells.

</findings>

<clinical>
Excitatory neurons, particularly CA1 pyramidal and EC deep/mid-layer subtypes, are the most transcriptionally vulnerable to AD pathology, showing early and progressive dysregulation of metabolic, synaptic, and stress-response pathways. These findings support the selective vulnerability of these subtypes in AD and suggest that their molecular alterations may contribute to cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. The highly specific NFT-responsive gene signatures in excitatory neuron subtypes may serve as potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets, though causality remains to be established. <keyFinding priority='1'>The study highlights the importance of targeting excitatory neuron subtypes, especially CA1 and EC, for mechanistic and therapeutic research in AD.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study provides a comprehensive single-cell atlas of excitatory neuron diversity and vulnerability in the human hippocampus and entorhinal cortex during AD progression. The identification of 14 anatomically and transcriptionally distinct excitatory neuron subtypes, with CA1 and EC neurons being most affected by NFT pathology, aligns with known patterns of selective vulnerability but adds molecular detail at single-cell resolution. The highly specific NFT-responsive gene signatures suggest that future research should focus on dissecting the functional consequences of these subtype-specific changes, including their roles in synaptic dysfunction, metabolic stress, and neuronal loss. Open questions include the causal relationships between transcriptional alterations and neurodegeneration, the potential for reversibility, and the impact of genetic risk factors (e.g., APOE) on excitatory neuron subtypes. The study’s findings are largely consistent with prior models of selective vulnerability but provide new molecular candidates and pathways for targeted intervention. No explicit contradictions with previous data are discussed by the authors. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Disease focus: Alzheimer's disease (AD), including Mendelian (PSEN1 p.A79V) and sporadic forms.
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on unsorted nuclei from frozen human parietal lobe tissue from three female donors: one PSEN1 p.A79V mutation carrier (Mendelian AD) and two relatives with sporadic AD. The study used 10x Genomics Chromium 5’ chemistry, with ~10,000 nuclei per sample and ~50,000 reads per nucleus. Data were aligned to both mature mRNA and pre-mRNA references, with pre-mRNA alignment yielding higher nuclei and gene counts. Clustering was performed using Seurat, with a consensus highly variable gene set (ConGen) to minimize donor bias. Cell type annotation relied on canonical marker genes, and excitatory neuron subtypes were further characterized using layer- and subtype-specific markers from the literature. No spatial or morphological validation was performed.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Excitatory neurons were a major focus. The proportion of excitatory neurons was reduced in the PSEN1 mutation carrier (Sample3: 68.1%) compared to the two sporadic AD cases (Sample1: 72.6%, Sample2: 75.7%). Inhibitory neuron proportions were similar across all samples (14.1–15.2%). <keyFinding priority='1'>The reduction in excitatory neuron proportion is a distinguishing feature of Mendelian AD in this dataset.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
The study identified multiple excitatory neuron subtypes, each corresponding to distinct cortical layers and expressing canonical marker genes (based on Lake et al., 2016):

- **Ex_1:** Layer 2, markers include CUX2, CARTPT, LAMP5, ACVR1C, GLRA3.
- **Ex_2:** Layers 2–4, markers include RORB, PRR16, PRSS12, PVRL3, RASGRF2, THSD7A.
- **Ex_4, Ex_5, Ex_6:** Layers 4–6, with Ex_4 and Ex_5 spanning layers 4–6, and Ex_6 in layers 5–6. Markers include FEZF2, HTR2C, PCP4, SULF2, KCNK2, GRIK4.
- **Ex_8:** Layers 5–6, markers include NXPH4, NXPH3, ADRA2A, NTNG2, TLE4, NR4A2, OPRK1, SYT6, FOXP2, RXFP1, RPRM, ETV1, TOX.

Each subtype was defined by its expression of layer- and subtype-specific markers, with clear separation in tSNE and hierarchical clustering analyses. <keyFinding priority='1'>Distinct excitatory neuron subtypes corresponding to cortical layers were robustly identified, each with characteristic marker gene expression.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression:**  
No specific disease-associated gene expression signatures were reported for excitatory neuron subtypes beyond the proportional reduction in the Mendelian AD case. The study did not report subtype-specific up- or down-regulation of individual genes in relation to disease status.

**Pathway Enrichment:**  
No pathway enrichment analysis specific to excitatory neuron subtypes was reported.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
No pseudotime or trajectory analysis was performed for excitatory neurons. The study did not model transitions between subtypes or disease progression within this cell type.

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
The main modulator identified was the presence of the PSEN1 p.A79V mutation, associated with a lower proportion of excitatory neurons. APOE genotype did not appear to influence excitatory neuron clustering or proportions in this small sample. <keyFinding priority='2'>PSEN1 mutation status, but not APOE genotype, was associated with excitatory neuron loss.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Gene Regulatory Networks, Cell-Cell Communication, Spatial Analysis:**  
No analysis of gene regulatory networks, ligand-receptor interactions, or spatial/morphological validation was performed for excitatory neurons.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
No eQTL or multi-omic integration was performed for excitatory neuron subtypes.

**Technical Notes:**  
The study emphasized the importance of using a consensus highly variable gene set to avoid donor bias in clustering, and validated that excitatory neuron subtypes were robust to this approach. <keyFinding priority='3'>Technical best practices for snRNA-seq clustering were established to ensure even donor representation and accurate cell type identification.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
The reduction in excitatory neuron proportion in the PSEN1 mutation carrier suggests that excitatory neuron loss may be a distinguishing feature of Mendelian AD compared to sporadic forms. This finding is consistent with prior bulk RNA-seq deconvolution results from the same group, but here is resolved at single-nucleus resolution and specifically attributed to excitatory neurons rather than inhibitory neurons or glia. The identification of distinct excitatory neuron subtypes provides a framework for future studies to investigate subtype-specific vulnerability or resilience in AD. However, the study does not establish causality or mechanistic links between excitatory neuron loss and clinical progression, nor does it identify therapeutic targets or biomarkers within these subtypes. <keyFinding priority='2'>Excitatory neuron loss may contribute to the distinct clinical and pathological features of Mendelian AD, but further studies are needed to clarify mechanisms and therapeutic implications.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**  
Del-Aguila et al. (2019) used snRNA-seq of parietal cortex from a PSEN1 p.A79V carrier and two sporadic AD cases to profile excitatory neurons, identifying multiple subtypes corresponding to cortical layers. The PSEN1 carrier exhibited a reduced proportion of excitatory neurons compared to sporadic AD, while inhibitory neuron proportions were similar. Each excitatory neuron subtype was defined by canonical marker genes (e.g., CUX2, RORB, FEZF2). The reduction in excitatory neurons was strongly associated with Mendelian mutation status, not APOE genotype. No disease-specific gene expression changes within excitatory subtypes were reported.

---

**Research Implications (≈150 words):**  
This study provides a foundational single-nucleus transcriptomic atlas of excitatory neuron diversity in AD, distinguishing Mendelian from sporadic forms at the cell type level. The robust identification of excitatory neuron subtypes, aligned with established classification schemes (e.g., Lake et al., 2016), supports the reproducibility of these subpopulations in human cortex. The observed reduction in excitatory neuron proportion in the PSEN1 carrier raises important questions about subtype-specific vulnerability and the mechanisms underlying selective neuronal loss in familial AD. However, the study is limited by small sample size, lack of neuropathology-free controls, and absence of spatial or functional validation. No direct evidence is provided for differential gene expression or pathway activation within excitatory neuron subtypes in relation to disease. Future work should expand sample size, include controls, and integrate spatial transcriptomics or functional assays to clarify the role of specific excitatory neuron subtypes in AD pathogenesis and progression. No explicit contradictions with prior models were discussed by the authors.

</metadata>

<methods>
This study integrates single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq), snATAC-seq, and snMultiome data from 388 adult prefrontal cortex (PFC) samples, spanning diverse ages, ancestries, and neuropsychiatric diagnoses.

Validation includes chromatin accessibility, marker gene expression, and spatial trajectory analyses.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Structure**  
Excitatory neurons are subdivided into multiple canonical subtypes corresponding to cortical layers: L2/3 IT, L4 IT, L5 IT, L6 IT, L6b, L5/6 NP, L5 ET, L6 CT, and Car3. These subtypes are robustly detected across individuals and validated by both transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility data. The study finds that excitatory neuron subtypes display high cell-type-specific expression variability, exceeding inter-individual variability for many genes, especially those involved in neurotransmission and neurodevelopment (<keyFinding priority='1'>Excitatory neuron subtypes show the highest cell-type-specific transcriptomic and regulatory diversity in the adult human PFC</keyFinding><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Subtype Characterization and Marker Genes**  
Each excitatory neuron subtype is defined by distinct marker genes and functional signatures:
- **L2/3 IT**: SLC17A7+, CUX1+, NEUROG1+, PAX3+; associated with upper-layer projection neurons.
- **L4 IT**: SLC17A7+, RORB+; intermediate-layer identity.
- **L5 IT/ET**: SLC17A7+, FEZF2+, BCL11B+ (L5 ET); deep-layer projection neurons.
- **L6 IT/CT**: TLE4+, FOXP2+ (L6 CT); corticothalamic projection neurons.
- **Car3**: Carbonic anhydrase 3+; rare, deep-layer subtype.
These subtypes are further distinguished by their chromatin accessibility profiles and regulatory element usage, with snATAC-seq confirming subtype-specific open chromatin at key marker loci (<keyFinding priority='1'>Distinct excitatory neuron subtypes are defined by canonical marker genes and validated by multi-omic data</keyFinding><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Disease Associations and Differential Expression**  
Excitatory neuron subtypes are highly enriched for differentially expressed (DE) genes in schizophrenia and other disorders. For example, schizophrenia cases show altered expression of risk genes (e.g., SEMA6A, RUNX2, SOX6, PROX1) across excitatory subtypes, with the number and magnitude of DE genes varying by subtype and disease status. Notably, the number of aging-associated DE genes is increased in schizophrenia, suggesting greater transcriptomic instability in excitatory neurons in disease (<keyFinding priority='2'>Excitatory neuron subtypes show increased aging-related DE genes in schizophrenia</keyFinding><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Pathway and Regulatory Network Insights**  
Pathway analysis reveals that excitatory neuron subtypes are enriched for genes involved in CNS morphogenesis, neurotransmitter reuptake, and synaptic signaling. Cell-type-specific gene regulatory networks (GRNs) highlight distinct transcription factor (TF) usage: CUX1, NEUROG1, and PAX3 are preferentially active in excitatory neurons, while other TFs (e.g., MEF2C, MAZ) act as hubs or bottlenecks in subtype-specific networks. These GRNs are experimentally validated using CRISPR perturbations, confirming predicted regulatory relationships (<keyFinding priority='1'>Excitatory neuron GRNs reveal subtype-specific TFs and regulatory logic, validated by CRISPR</keyFinding><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**eQTLs and Genetic Modulation**  
The study identifies ~85,000 cis-eQTLs per cell type, with ~1.4 million scQTLs in total. Many eQTLs are unique to excitatory neuron subtypes and are not detected in bulk tissue, with effect sizes often larger in single-cell data. Dynamic eQTLs show regulatory effects that change smoothly across cortical depth (pseudotime), especially in excitatory neurons, linking genetic variation to spatially patterned gene expression (<keyFinding priority='1'>Excitatory neuron subtypes harbor unique and dynamic eQTLs, many undetectable in bulk</keyFinding><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Spatial and Temporal Trajectories**  
Trajectory analysis (pseudotime) across excitatory neuron subtypes recapitulates the cortical layer axis (L2/3 → L6), with gene expression gradients validated by spatial transcriptomics. Dynamic regulatory effects and gene expression changes are observed along this axis, supporting a model of continuous molecular transitions across excitatory neuron subtypes (<keyFinding priority='2'>Excitatory neuron subtypes form a spatial and molecular continuum across cortical layers</keyFinding><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Aging and Disease Progression**  
Excitatory neuron transcriptomes are highly predictive of individual age, with specific subtypes (L2/3 IT, L4 IT, L5 IT, L6 IT) contributing most to age prediction models. Aging is associated with upregulation of stress-response genes (e.g., HSPB1) and downregulation of synaptic genes in excitatory neurons. Disease states (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder) further modulate these trajectories, with altered cell-cell communication and pathway activity (e.g., Wnt signaling) in excitatory subtypes (<keyFinding priority='2'>Aging and disease modulate excitatory neuron transcriptomes and regulatory networks</keyFinding><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Cell-Cell Communication**  
Excitatory neurons participate in distinct ligand-receptor networks, with altered incoming and outgoing signaling in disease. For example, in schizophrenia, excitatory neurons receive less incoming signaling, while inhibitory neurons receive more. Wnt pathway signaling is downregulated in excitatory neurons in both schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, with cell-type-specific changes in sender-receiver relationships (<keyFinding priority='2'>Excitatory neuron cell-cell communication networks are rewired in neuropsychiatric disease</keyFinding><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Genetic and Demographic Modulators**  
Genetic risk variants (from GWAS and eQTLs) are highly enriched in excitatory neuron regulatory elements and DE genes. Age is a strong modulator of excitatory neuron transcriptomes, while sex and ancestry effects are less pronounced but detectable in some subtypes. The integrative LNCTP model links genotype to cell-type-specific expression and disease risk, prioritizing excitatory neuron subtypes as key mediators of genetic effects in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (<keyFinding priority='1'>Genetic risk for neuropsychiatric disease converges on excitatory neuron subtypes</keyFinding><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

</findings>

<clinical>
Excitatory neuron subtypes are central to the genetic architecture and regulatory landscape of neuropsychiatric disorders. Disease risk genes and regulatory variants converge on specific excitatory subtypes, with dynamic regulatory effects across cortical layers and aging. These findings suggest that excitatory neuron subtypes may mediate disease risk and progression, and that their molecular signatures could serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets. However, most associations are cross-sectional and computational, so causal claims remain tentative.
</clinical>

---

3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study establishes a comprehensive, multi-omic atlas of excitatory neuron subtypes in the adult human PFC, revealing pronounced cell-type-specific regulatory logic, genetic modulation, and disease associations. The identification of dynamic eQTLs and regulatory elements unique to excitatory neuron subtypes advances our understanding of how genetic risk for neuropsychiatric disorders is implemented at the cellular level. The findings align with and extend prior classification schemes (e.g., BICCN), confirming the molecular distinctiveness of canonical excitatory neuron subtypes and their spatial organization across cortical layers. Open questions remain regarding the causal roles of specific subtypes and regulatory networks in disease progression, the impact of developmental and environmental factors, and the generalizability of findings to other brain regions. The study does not report explicit contradictions with prior models but highlights the increased resolution and specificity afforded by single-cell approaches compared to bulk tissue analyses. Future work should integrate longitudinal and functional studies to clarify the temporal dynamics and causal mechanisms linking excitatory neuron subtypes to neuropsychiatric disease.

# summary for Frolich 2024 (excitatory neurons)

<quickReference>
Excitatory neurons in the human orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) show widespread, cell-type-specific transcriptomic changes with aging, with upper-layer (Exc_L2–L3) and deep-layer (Exc_L4–L6_2) excitatory neuron subtypes exhibiting the largest number of differentially expressed genes. Most age-related changes in excitatory neurons involve downregulation of synaptic and neuronal function genes, with strong convergence between aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) signatures. Accelerated transcriptomic aging is observed in individuals with psychiatric disorders, shifting excitatory neuron aging trajectories.

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) was performed on ~800,000 nuclei from the OFC of 87 individuals (ages 26–84), including both neurotypical controls and those with psychiatric diagnoses. Cell types and subtypes were identified using Leiden clustering and marker gene expression. Differential expression analyses were adjusted for covariates and validated in an independent cohort (n=32). Morphological validation was not performed for excitatory neuron subtypes, but findings were cross-validated with bulk and single-cell datasets.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Excitatory neuron abundance did not significantly change with age, but upper-layer (Exc_L2–L3) and deep-layer (Exc_L4–L6_2) subtypes showed the largest number of age-associated differentially expressed (DE) genes. <keyFinding priority='1'>Exc_L2–L3 neurons had the highest number of DE genes among all cell types, indicating strong transcriptomic remodeling with age.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Excitatory Neuron Subtypes Identified:**  
The study identified several excitatory neuron subtypes, each with distinct marker genes and layer-specific signatures:

  - **Key findings:** Largest number of age-related DE genes; most changes were downregulation of synaptic and neuronal function genes.  
  - **Functional signature:** Downregulation of genes involved in synaptic signaling, neurotransmitter secretion, and axo-dendritic transport.  
  - **Disease association:** Downregulated genes in Exc_L2–L3 overlapped significantly with those downregulated in AD and psychiatric disease.  
  - **Notable genes:** FKBP5 (upregulated with age), NRGN (downregulated), NPTX2 (downregulated), RPH3A (downregulated).  
  - **Pathway enrichment:** Synaptic signaling, mRNA splicing, neurotransmitter secretion.

  - **Key findings:** Exc_L4–L6_2 had the second highest number of DE genes after Exc_L2–L3.  
  - **Functional signature:** Downregulation of synaptic and neuronal function genes; upregulation of stress-response and mRNA splicing genes.  
  - **Disease association:** Downregulated genes in deep-layer excitatory neurons overlapped with those in AD and psychiatric disease.  
  - **Notable genes:** KCTD17 and LINGO1 showed opposite regulation in aging (down) vs. AD (up), suggesting potential protective roles.  
  - <keyFinding priority='1'>Exc_L4–L6_2 neurons are among the most transcriptionally affected by aging, with strong overlap with AD and psychiatric disease signatures.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression & Pathways:**  
- Most DE genes in excitatory neurons were downregulated with age, especially those involved in synaptic signaling, neurotransmitter secretion, and axo-dendritic transport.  
- Upregulated genes included those involved in mRNA splicing and stress response (e.g., FKBP5).  
- Shared DE genes across excitatory neuron subtypes included NRGN (downregulated), CAMK4 (downregulated), FKBP5 (upregulated), NPTX2 (downregulated).  
- Pathway enrichment analysis highlighted disrupted synaptic transmission and mRNA splicing as convergently affected pathways.  
- <keyFinding priority='1'>Downregulation of synaptic and neuronal function genes in excitatory neurons is a convergent signature of aging and AD.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
- No significant change in excitatory neuron abundance with age.  
- Accelerated transcriptomic aging in psychiatric disease: individuals with psychiatric diagnoses showed increased transcriptomic age acceleration in excitatory neurons, with a shift in aging trajectories and greater overlap with disease-associated gene signatures.  
- Polygenic risk scores for psychiatric disorders did not explain the convergence, suggesting environmental or disease-related factors.

**Gene Regulatory Networks:**  
- No specific transcription factors highlighted for excitatory neuron aging, but CAMK4 (a transcriptional regulator) was downregulated.

**Cell-Cell Communication & Spatial Analysis:**  
- No spatial or morphological validation for excitatory neuron subtypes reported.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
- Pseudotime and cross-sectional modeling suggest that age-related transcriptomic changes in excitatory neurons overlap with those seen in AD and are accelerated in psychiatric disease.  
- KCTD17 and LINGO1 are downregulated with age but upregulated in AD, suggesting a possible protective role in normal aging.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
- No enrichment of age-related DE genes in excitatory neurons for psychiatric GWAS loci, but strong enrichment for AD GWAS loci in microglia (not excitatory neurons).

<clinical>
Excitatory neurons, especially upper- and deep-layer subtypes, are highly susceptible to age-related transcriptomic remodeling, primarily involving downregulation of synaptic and neuronal function genes. These changes converge with those observed in AD, suggesting that gradual, age-related synaptic deficits in excitatory neurons may contribute to neurodegenerative vulnerability. Accelerated transcriptomic aging in psychiatric disease further shifts excitatory neuron trajectories toward disease-associated states, potentially increasing risk for cognitive decline and neurodegeneration. The identification of genes with opposite regulation in aging versus AD (e.g., KCTD17, LINGO1) highlights potential therapeutic targets for promoting resilience or delaying disease onset. <keyFinding priority='1'>Excitatory neuron aging signatures may serve as early biomarkers or intervention points for both neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</clinical>
</detailedSummary>

<researchImplications>
This study provides a comprehensive, cell-type-resolved atlas of age-associated transcriptomic changes in human OFC excitatory neurons, revealing strong convergence with AD and psychiatric disease signatures. Open questions include the causal mechanisms linking synaptic gene downregulation to cognitive decline, the functional consequences of accelerated aging in psychiatric disease, and the potential for reversing or delaying these changes. The identification of KCTD17 and LINGO1 as genes with opposite regulation in aging versus AD suggests new avenues for therapeutic intervention. The findings align with prior models of synaptic vulnerability in aging and AD, but the explicit demonstration of accelerated transcriptomic aging in psychiatric disease is novel. Future work should address the functional impact of these transcriptomic changes, their spatial and morphological correlates, and their modulation by genetic and environmental factors. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

# summary for Fujita 2024 (excitatory neurons)

<quickReference>
This large-scale snRNA-seq study of aged human neocortex (Nature Genetics, 2024) mapped cis-eQTLs across 64 cell subtypes, including 16 excitatory neuron subtypes. Excitatory neurons yielded the highest number of eGenes (7,331), with 1,258 eGenes uniquely detected at the subtype level. Subtype-specific eQTLs in excitatory neurons were further linked to Alzheimer’s and other brain disease GWAS loci, and a TMEM106B variant was found to specifically affect the proportion of an excitatory neuron subtype (Exc.3). Age, sex, and genetic background (notably TMEM106B and AD risk variants) modulate these effects.

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) was performed on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) tissue from 424 aged individuals (ROS/MAP cohorts), with paired whole-genome sequencing. Major cell types and 64 subtypes (including 16 excitatory neuron subtypes) were identified. Pseudobulk eQTL mapping was performed per cell type and subtype, with extensive covariate adjustment. Validation included comparison to bulk RNA-seq, iPSC-derived neurons, and chromatin state annotation.
</methods>
<findings>
Excitatory neurons were the most abundant cell type in the dataset and yielded the largest number of eGenes (7,331 at the cell type level). Notably, when excitatory neurons were subdivided into 16 subtypes, 1,258 eGenes were uniquely detected at the subtype level and not in the pooled cell type analysis, indicating substantial hidden regulatory heterogeneity. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> This demonstrates that cell subtype resolution is critical for uncovering genetic regulation of gene expression in excitatory neurons.</keyFinding>

The 16 excitatory neuron subtypes (Exc.1–Exc.16) were defined by unsupervised clustering, but the paper does not provide a detailed marker gene list for each subtype in the main text. However, the subtypes are distinguished by their transcriptional profiles and likely correspond to known laminar or projectional classes, as inferred from prior DLPFC atlases. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> The study emphasizes that many eQTLs are only detectable in specific excitatory neuron subtypes, not in the pooled population, suggesting functional specialization and context-dependent genetic effects.</keyFinding>

Cell type and subtype proportions were quantitatively linked to eGene discovery: excitatory neuron subtypes with higher abundance yielded more eGenes, but the slope of eGene discovery per cell proportion was much steeper at the subtype level (β=454 per 1% increase) than at the cell type level (β=190), indicating that subtypes are especially informative for eQTL mapping. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

A key genetic finding was the identification of a TMEM106B variant (rs5011436) as a fraction QTL (fQTL) specifically affecting the proportion of the Exc.3 excitatory neuron subtype. The risk allele (A) was associated with increased Exc.3 proportion and higher TMEM106B expression, and this effect was replicated in an independent bulk RNA-seq dataset using deconvolution. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> This is the only variant in the study found to robustly affect the proportion of any excitatory neuron subtype.</keyFinding>

Colocalization analyses with GWAS loci for Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, schizophrenia, and educational attainment revealed that several disease risk variants exert their effects through excitatory neuron subtypes. For example, in Alzheimer’s disease, the APH1B locus colocalized with eQTLs in excitatory neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, while the GRN locus showed colocalization in both oligodendrocytes and excitatory neurons. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> This supports a direct role for excitatory neuron subtypes in mediating genetic risk for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders.</keyFinding>

Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) using cell type-specific expression weights confirmed that excitatory neurons harbor the largest number of genetically regulated genes associated with schizophrenia and Parkinson’s disease, and a substantial number for Alzheimer’s disease. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> This highlights the centrality of excitatory neuron subtypes in the genetic architecture of these disorders.</keyFinding>

Replication in iPSC-derived neurons showed that a subset of excitatory neuron eQTLs (234/6,414, or 3.6%) were recapitulated in vitro, with effect sizes largely concordant in direction. However, some eQTLs (e.g., for MAPT) showed opposite effect directions in iPSC-derived neurons versus brain tissue, underscoring context specificity. <keyFinding priority='3'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

No major spatial or morphological validation of excitatory neuron subtypes is reported in this study, nor are specific laminar or projectional identities assigned in the main text. The study does not report major age, sex, or APOE genotype effects on excitatory neuron subtypes beyond the TMEM106B finding.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> The authors do not explicitly discuss contradictions with prior excitatory neuron subtype models, but note that many eQTLs are missed in bulk or pooled analyses.
</findings>
<clinical>
Excitatory neuron subtypes are shown to be key mediators of genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, and schizophrenia, with subtype-specific eQTLs and fQTLs linking GWAS loci to neuronal gene expression and cell proportion changes. The TMEM106B variant’s effect on Exc.3 proportion may contribute to disease risk via neuronal vulnerability or resilience, though causality remains to be established. The identification of subtype-specific eQTLs provides a refined map for prioritizing candidate genes and cell types for functional studies and potential therapeutic targeting in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</clinical>
</detailedSummary>

<researchImplications>
This study establishes that excitatory neuron subtypes in the aged human cortex harbor extensive, previously unrecognized regulatory heterogeneity, with many eQTLs and disease associations only detectable at the subtype level. The Exc.3 subtype, modulated by TMEM106B, emerges as a genetically regulated neuronal population of interest in Alzheimer’s disease and related disorders. Open questions include the precise functional identities and roles of each excitatory neuron subtype, their spatial and laminar distribution, and how subtype-specific regulatory variation contributes to disease pathogenesis. The findings align with, but greatly extend, prior models by demonstrating that bulk or pooled analyses substantially underestimate the complexity of neuronal genetic regulation. The study highlights the need for future work to functionally characterize these subtypes, validate their disease associations in vivo, and explore their potential as therapeutic targets or biomarkers. No explicit conflicts with prior excitatory neuron classification schemes are discussed, but the results suggest that single-nucleus resolution is essential for accurate mapping of genetic effects in the human brain.

</metadata>

<methods>
The study used droplet-based single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on postmortem brain tissue from 5 severe COVID-19 patients and 4 controls. Three regions were sampled: dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC), medulla oblongata, and choroid plexus (ChP). Cell type annotation was based on canonical marker genes. Viral presence was assessed by western blot, targeted RNA-seq, and RNA-FISH; all were negative for SARS-CoV-2. Data were analyzed for cell type proportions, differential gene expression, pathway enrichment, and gene regulatory networks.  
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Excitatory neurons (Ex), identified by high expression of SYT1 and SLC17A7, were robustly detected in the PFC and to a lesser extent in the medulla and ChP.

The exact number of DEGs in excitatory neurons is not specified in the main text, but Figure 2A shows that Ex in ChP had approximately 50–60 upregulated genes and a smaller number of downregulated genes.

<clinical>
The study provides limited evidence for a direct role of excitatory neurons in the acute neuroinflammatory response to COVID-19. While moderate transcriptional changes were observed in the choroid plexus, the lack of major pathway enrichment or subtype-specific findings suggests that excitatory neurons are not primary mediators of COVID-19-associated neuropathology in this cohort. The results do not support a strong disease-driving or protective role for excitatory neuron subpopulations in severe COVID-19, nor do they suggest immediate biomarker or therapeutic implications for this cell type.
</clinical>

3) **Research Implications**

The findings from Fullard et al. (2021) indicate that, in the context of severe COVID-19, excitatory neurons in the human brain—particularly in the choroid plexus—undergo moderate transcriptional changes, but do not show major shifts in abundance, subtype composition, or pathway activation. The absence of distinct disease-associated excitatory neuron subtypes or strong pathway signatures contrasts with the pronounced activation observed in microglia and other immune cells. This suggests that excitatory neurons may be relatively resilient to acute COVID-19-related neuroinflammation, or that their involvement is secondary to immune-mediated processes. Open questions remain regarding the long-term impact of these moderate transcriptional changes, potential vulnerability in other disease stages, and whether more subtle functional alterations (e.g., synaptic dysfunction) might emerge with larger cohorts or more targeted analyses. The lack of contradiction with prior models is explicitly noted by the authors, and the results are broadly consistent with other single-nucleus studies reporting limited direct neuronal involvement in acute COVID-19 neuropathology.

Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), single-nucleus ATAC-seq, and spatial transcriptomics (MERFISH) were performed on the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) from 84 aged human donors spanning the full spectrum of AD neuropathology. Cell types were mapped to a high-resolution BRAIN Initiative reference taxonomy, with additional validation in Brodmann area 9 (A9) and replication in 10 external snRNA-seq datasets from prefrontal cortex (PFC). Quantitative neuropathology was used to generate a continuous pseudoprogression score (CPS) for disease staging.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Disease Progression**  
Excitatory neurons in the MTG, particularly those in superficial layers (L2/3 intratelencephalic-projecting, IT), show a marked and selective vulnerability in Alzheimer’s disease. The study’s continuous pseudoprogression score (CPS) revealed two disease epochs: an early phase with minimal excitatory neuron loss, and a late phase characterized by a sharp, exponential decline in specific excitatory neuron subtypes as pathology accelerates. This pattern was robustly replicated in A9 and across multiple external datasets. <keyFinding priority='1'>The loss of L2/3 IT excitatory neuron subtypes is a major, late-stage event in AD progression, tightly associated with increased amyloid and tau pathology and cognitive decline.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization**  
The BRAIN Initiative taxonomy enabled high-resolution mapping of excitatory neuron diversity. Within the broad class of excitatory neurons, the following subtypes were most affected:

- **L2/3 IT (Intratelencephalic-projecting) neurons**:  
  - **Defining markers**: CUX2, RORB, SATB2, and other canonical upper-layer markers.
  - **Functional signature**: These neurons are long-range corticocortical projection cells, critical for associative and integrative cortical functions.
  - **Disease association**: L2/3 IT subtypes (e.g., L2/3 IT_1, L2/3 IT_13) show a pronounced, late-stage decrease in relative abundance along the CPS, coinciding with exponential increases in amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. This loss is spatially restricted to superficial cortical layers, as validated by MERFISH spatial transcriptomics. <keyFinding priority='1'>L2/3 IT neuron loss is a hallmark of late AD, with strong spatial and molecular validation.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
  - **Temporal dynamics**: Loss occurs after early interneuron (Sst+) loss and is tightly linked to cognitive impairment.

- **L5 IT and L5 ET (extratelencephalic-projecting) neurons**:  
  - **Defining markers**: FEZF2, BCL11B, and others.
  - **Functional signature**: Deep-layer projection neurons.
  - **Disease association**: Some L5 IT subtypes also decrease in late CPS, but the effect is less pronounced and occurs after L2/3 IT loss. <keyFinding priority='2'>L5 IT neuron loss is a secondary, late-stage event.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

- **L4 IT and L6 IT/CT neurons**:  
  - **Defining markers**: RORB (L4), TLE4 (L6), etc.
  - **Disease association**: These subtypes are less affected, with minimal or no significant changes in abundance across CPS. <keyFinding priority='3'>L4 and L6 excitatory neurons are relatively spared in AD progression.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**  
- Across all excitatory neuron subtypes, there is a broad downregulation of electron transport chain (ETC) and ribosomal genes as CPS increases, indicating metabolic and translational stress. <keyFinding priority='2'>Downregulation of ETC and ribosomal genes is a pan-excitatory neuron response to AD pathology.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- L2/3 IT neurons, in particular, show pronounced loss of these pathways late in CPS, coinciding with cell loss.
- No unique upregulated disease-associated markers were highlighted for excitatory neurons, in contrast to microglia or astrocytes.

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**  
- MERFISH spatial transcriptomics confirmed that vulnerable L2/3 IT subtypes are localized to superficial cortical layers and that their loss is spatially restricted.
- Loss of excitatory neurons was also validated by NeuN immunostaining, which showed a linear decrease in NeuN+ cells along CPS, with the most severe loss in donors with steep cognitive decline.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**  
- The loss of L2/3 IT neurons is a late event, following early loss of Sst+ interneurons and preceding or coinciding with cognitive impairment.
- Severely affected donors (with steep memory decline) show the most pronounced loss of excitatory neurons and global transcriptional shutdown.

**Modulators & Metrics**  
- The presence of the APOE4 allele is enriched in high ADNC cases and may modulate vulnerability, but no specific excitatory neuron subtype was uniquely associated with APOE4 in this study.
- Age and sex were included as covariates; female donors were overrepresented in high pathology groups, consistent with AD epidemiology.

**Gene Regulatory Networks and Cell-Cell Communication**  
- No excitatory neuron-specific regulatory networks or ligand-receptor interactions were highlighted as major drivers of vulnerability in this study.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**  
- No direct eQTL or GWAS variant associations were reported for excitatory neuron subtypes in this dataset.

Excitatory neuron loss, especially of L2/3 IT subtypes, is a defining feature of late-stage Alzheimer’s disease in the MTG and is tightly linked to cognitive decline. The spatially and temporally restricted loss of these neurons suggests a critical role in the breakdown of cortical circuits underlying associative and integrative functions. While the study does not establish causality, the strong association between L2/3 IT neuron loss, pathology burden, and dementia supports their potential as biomarkers of disease progression and as targets for therapeutic intervention. <keyFinding priority='1'>L2/3 IT neuron loss may serve as a cellular correlate of cognitive impairment in AD.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Quick Reference (≈100 words)**  
The SEA-AD atlas reveals that excitatory neuron loss in Alzheimer’s disease is highly subtype- and layer-specific: L2/3 intratelencephalic (IT) neurons in the middle temporal gyrus are selectively and dramatically depleted in late-stage AD, as defined by a continuous pseudoprogression score. This loss is spatially restricted to superficial cortical layers and tightly associated with increased amyloid/tau pathology and cognitive decline. The pattern is robust across regions and replicated in external datasets. Female sex and APOE4 allele are enriched in high pathology cases but do not uniquely drive excitatory neuron vulnerability.

---

**Research Implications (≈200 words)**  
This study provides the most granular evidence to date that excitatory neuron loss in Alzheimer’s disease is not uniform, but instead targets specific subtypes—most notably L2/3 IT neurons in superficial cortical layers—at late disease stages. The findings align with, and extend, previous reports of selective vulnerability in upper-layer projection neurons, but the high-resolution taxonomy and spatial validation here offer unprecedented specificity. The robust replication across regions and external datasets strengthens confidence in these results. Open questions remain regarding the molecular mechanisms underlying this selective vulnerability: while broad metabolic and translational downregulation is observed, no unique disease-associated gene signature was identified for excitatory neurons, in contrast to glial cell types. The lack of direct genetic or regulatory drivers suggests that vulnerability may be conferred by circuit position, connectivity, or extrinsic factors (e.g., microglial activation). Future work should address whether interventions targeting circuit resilience or metabolic support in L2/3 IT neurons can mitigate cognitive decline. No explicit contradictions with prior models were discussed; rather, the study’s findings are positioned as a unifying framework for understanding cell-type-specific neurodegeneration in AD.

This study found that excitatory neurons in human Alzheimer’s disease cortex, as assessed by snRNA-seq, did **not display significant disease-associated transcriptional changes or subtype shifts**. The depletion strategy used in this study resulted in low neuronal representation, and bulk RNA-seq of sorted NEUN+ nuclei also failed to reveal consistent AD- or age-related alterations in excitatory neurons. Thus, the main findings for excitatory neurons are negative, with no evidence for disease-associated subtypes or marker gene changes in this dataset. <keyFinding priority='2'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> (due to large sample size and explicit negative results). <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Detailed Summary:

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Representation**  
The study’s primary focus was on non-neuronal cell types, and the experimental design specifically depleted NEUN+ (neuronal) and OLIG2+ (oligodendrocyte) nuclei prior to snRNA-seq. As a result, excitatory neurons were underrepresented in the single-nucleus dataset, with the majority of nuclei derived from microglia and astrocytes (see Fig. 1d, e). The authors explicitly state that “90% of the isolated nuclei were either derived from neurons (NEUNpos) or oligodendrocytes/OPCs (OLIG2pos)” in the initial pool, but these populations were largely removed before sequencing the main dataset. <keyFinding priority='2'>The main snRNA-seq dataset contained very few excitatory neuron nuclei, precluding detailed analysis of neuronal subtypes or disease-associated changes.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Bulk RNA-seq of Sorted Excitatory Neurons**  
To address the possibility of neuronal changes, the authors performed bulk RNA-seq on sorted NEUN+ nuclei (which are highly enriched for excitatory neurons in cortex). These samples showed robust expression of neuronal marker genes (RBFOX3, MAP2) and lacked microglial or astrocytic markers, confirming their identity (Supplementary Fig. S3b, g). However, principal component analysis and differential gene expression analysis revealed **no consistent AD-associated or age-associated changes** in excitatory neurons by bulk RNA-seq (Supplementary Fig. S3c–e). The authors state:  
> “Although regional differences were observed in the NEUNpos population, no consistent AD-associated or age-associated changes were identified in either NEUNpos or OLIG2pos nuclei by bulk RNAseq.”  
<keyFinding priority='2'>Bulk RNA-seq of sorted excitatory neurons did not reveal significant disease- or age-related transcriptional changes.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Excitatory Neuron Subtypes and Disease-Associated States**  
Because of the depletion strategy and low neuronal representation in the main snRNA-seq dataset, the study did **not identify or characterize excitatory neuron subtypes or disease-associated neuronal states**. There is no mention of distinct excitatory neuron clusters, marker genes, or functional signatures in the results or supplementary figures. The authors note that their approach “might have precluded the detection of possible subtle AD-associated gene expression changes in depleted cell types.”  
<keyFinding priority='2'>No excitatory neuron subtypes or disease-associated states were identified or characterized in this study.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Spatial, Morphological, and Temporal Data**  
No spatial or morphological validation was performed for excitatory neurons, and no pseudotime or trajectory analyses were conducted for this cell type. All such analyses were focused on microglia.

**Modulators & Metrics**  
No host or genetic factors (age, sex, APOE, GWAS variants) were found to modulate excitatory neuron states or gene expression in this dataset.

**Gene Regulatory Networks, Cell-Cell Communication, and Multi-omic Integration**  
No findings were reported for excitatory neurons in these categories.

**Summary of Negative Findings**  
The authors are explicit that their enrichment strategy and study design prioritized non-neuronal cell types, and as a result, “lower numbers of the other cell types” (including neurons) were obtained, which “might have precluded the detection of possible subtle AD-associated gene expression changes in depleted cell types.”  
<keyFinding priority='2'>Overall, the study provides strong negative evidence for disease-associated transcriptional changes or subtype shifts in excitatory neurons in the analyzed AD and control cortical samples.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
The study does not report any disease-specific roles, mechanistic insights, or biomarker/therapeutic implications for excitatory neurons in Alzheimer’s disease. The lack of observed changes in excitatory neurons suggests that, within the limitations of this dataset, excitatory neuronal transcriptional profiles are not detectably altered in AD cortex, or that such changes are below the detection threshold due to low representation. The authors caution that their depletion strategy may have limited the ability to detect subtle or rare disease-associated neuronal states. <keyFinding priority='2'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</clinical>

Research Implications:

The absence of detectable disease-associated transcriptional changes or subtypes in excitatory neurons in this study highlights a key limitation of depletion-based enrichment strategies for snRNA-seq: while they greatly increase the representation of rare glial populations, they can severely underpower analyses of neurons. The negative findings here are robust within the context of the dataset, but do not rule out the existence of subtle or rare disease-associated neuronal states that might be detectable with neuron-enriched or unbiased approaches. The authors’ results contrast with some prior snRNA-seq studies that have reported AD-associated neuronal gene expression changes, but those studies used unsorted nuclei and had higher neuronal representation. <contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag> (The authors explicitly note that their approach may have missed subtle neuronal changes, and that other studies have reported such changes using different methodologies.)

Future studies aiming to characterize excitatory neuron heterogeneity and disease-associated states in AD should employ strategies that retain or enrich for neuronal nuclei, and may benefit from integrating spatial transcriptomics or single-cell multi-omics to capture rare or regionally restricted neuronal phenotypes. The lack of findings here does not contradict the broader literature, but rather reflects a methodological trade-off that prioritizes glial cell discovery at the expense of neuronal coverage.

# summary for Green 2024 (excitatory neurons)

1) **Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This large-scale single-nucleus RNA-seq study of aged human prefrontal cortex (n=437) identifies **16 excitatory neuron subtypes (Exc.1–16)**, each mapped to specific cortical layers and marked by distinct gene expression profiles. While most excitatory neuron subtypes show stable proportions across aging and Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression, **Exc.15 (layer 5/6, MEPE+) increases** and **Exc.1 (layer 2/3, CUX2+) decreases** with AD pathology and cognitive decline. These changes are robustly replicated in an independent bulk RNA-seq cohort (n=673). The study finds that excitatory neuron vulnerability is subtype-specific and not globally driven by APOE ε4 or sex, but is associated with AD pathology load and disease trajectory. <keyFinding priority='1'></keyFinding>

**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Identification**

Excitatory neurons were the most abundant neuronal class, with **16 subtypes (Exc.1–16)** identified by unsupervised clustering and mapped to cortical layers using Allen Brain Atlas reference signatures. Each subtype is defined by unique marker genes and laminar localization:

- **Exc.1–4:** Upper layer (2/3) neurons, CUX2+, LINC00507+, THEMIS+.
- **Exc.5–9:** Mid-layer (3–5) neurons, RORB+, LAMP5+.
- **Exc.10–16:** Deep layer (5/6) neurons, FEZF2+, MEPE+, THEMIS+.

The proportions of most excitatory neuron subtypes were stable across individuals, regardless of age, sex, or AD diagnosis, indicating overall resilience of this cell class in aging and disease. <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Subtype-Specific Vulnerability and Disease Association**

However, two subtypes showed significant, robust, and replicated changes in AD:

- **Exc.15 (deep layer 5/6, MEPE+):** Proportion **increased** with higher neocortical tau and amyloid-β (Aβ) burden and with faster cognitive decline. This association was significant in both the discovery (snRNA-seq) and replication (bulk RNA-seq) cohorts, and meta-analysis further strengthened the evidence. <keyFinding priority='1'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **Exc.1 (upper layer 2/3, CUX2+):** Proportion **decreased** with increasing AD pathology and cognitive decline, again robust across cohorts. <keyFinding priority='2'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Other subtypes (e.g., Exc.8, Exc.11) showed nominal or cohort-specific associations, but these did not survive meta-analysis correction.

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**

Excitatory neuron subtypes were distinguished by canonical markers (e.g., CUX2, LINC00507, THEMIS, RORB, FEZF2, MEPE) and by layer-specific expression of synaptic and projection-related genes. The study did not report major AD-associated transcriptional reprogramming within excitatory neurons, in contrast to glial populations. Pathway analysis highlighted subtype-specific enrichment for synaptic transmission, axonogenesis, and calcium signaling, but no strong disease-associated pathway shifts were described for excitatory neurons as a class. <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Disease Trajectories and Cellular Communities**

Using the BEYOND framework, the authors reconstructed two major cellular trajectories in aging cortex: one leading to AD (prAD) and one representing alternative brain aging (ABA). Excitatory neuron subtypes did not define these trajectories, but Exc.15 and Exc.1 were among the few neuronal subtypes whose proportions changed along the prAD trajectory, paralleling increases in tau/Aβ and cognitive decline. Most other excitatory subtypes remained stable, suggesting that vulnerability is not uniform across this class. <keyFinding priority='2'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators & Metrics**

No significant modulation of excitatory neuron subtypes by APOE ε4 genotype, sex, or age was reported after controlling for pathology. The observed changes in Exc.15 and Exc.1 were primarily associated with AD pathology load and prAD trajectory assignment. <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Spatial/Morphological Validation**

The study did not report spatial transcriptomics or immunohistochemical validation specifically for excitatory neuron subtypes, focusing such analyses on glial populations. However, the laminar mapping of subtypes to cortical layers was supported by transcriptomic reference signatures. <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Gene Regulatory Networks, Cell-Cell Communication, and Multi-omic Integration**

No major findings were reported for excitatory neuron-specific gene regulatory networks, ligand-receptor interactions, or genetic risk variant enrichment. The main genetic and regulatory drivers of AD-associated changes were identified in glial populations, not excitatory neurons. <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
Excitatory neurons as a class are relatively resilient to aging and AD, but **specific subtypes (notably Exc.15 and Exc.1) show selective vulnerability**. The increase in Exc.15 and decrease in Exc.1 proportions are strongly associated with AD pathology and cognitive decline, suggesting that laminar and molecular identity confers differential risk. These findings imply that excitatory neuron loss or dysfunction in AD is not global but subtype-specific, and that targeting mechanisms underlying Exc.15 expansion or Exc.1 loss may offer new therapeutic or biomarker avenues. However, the study does not establish causality or mechanistic pathways for these changes. <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</clinical>

---

3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study provides a high-confidence, large-scale map of excitatory neuron diversity in the aged and AD cortex, demonstrating that **subtype-specific changes—not global excitatory neuron loss—characterize AD progression**. The robust increase in Exc.15 (deep layer, MEPE+) and decrease in Exc.1 (upper layer, CUX2+) with AD pathology and cognitive decline highlight the need to dissect molecular and circuit mechanisms underlying selective vulnerability. These findings align with, but also refine, prior models suggesting laminar and projection-specific neuron loss in AD. Open questions include whether Exc.15 expansion reflects compensatory sprouting, resistance to degeneration, or aberrant reprogramming, and whether Exc.1 loss is due to cell death, dedifferentiation, or migration. The lack of strong genetic or regulatory drivers in excitatory neurons, compared to glia, suggests that neuron-intrinsic vulnerability may be secondary to glial or microenvironmental changes. Future work should integrate spatial, morphological, and longitudinal data to clarify the fate and function of these subtypes, and to test whether they can serve as early biomarkers or therapeutic targets. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on entorhinal cortex tissue from 6 AD patients and 6 age- and sex-matched controls (total n=12). Nuclei were isolated, FACS-sorted, and sequenced using the 10x Genomics platform. Cell types were identified using established marker gene sets, and subclustering was performed with Seurat. Differential expression and gene set enrichment analyses were conducted, and regulatory network inference was performed using CellRouter.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and General Patterns**  
Excitatory neurons were robustly identified using canonical markers (e.g., SYT1, glutamate receptors such as GRIK2, GRIA1, GRIN2B, and RBFOX1). The study did not report a dramatic loss of excitatory neuron numbers in AD, but did observe pronounced transcriptional changes. In UMAP space, AD and control neurons segregated, indicating disease-associated transcriptional reprogramming.

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathways**  
Excitatory neurons in AD showed significant downregulation of genes involved in synaptic transmission and plasticity, including SNAP25 and RIMS1 (<keyFinding priority='1'>Downregulation of synaptic transmission genes in AD excitatory neurons</keyFinding><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>). There was also downregulation of genes related to cognition and synapse organization (e.g., GRIA2, GRID2, NRXN1, NRXN3), as captured in the DEG2 module, which was suppressed in AD neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and OPCs. This is consistent with prior reports of synaptic module loss in AD (<keyFinding priority='2'>Loss of synaptic gene module connectivity in AD excitatory neurons</keyFinding><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

Gene set enrichment analysis revealed that control excitatory neuron subclusters (notably n6) were enriched for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation genes (NDUF, SDH, UQCR, COX, ATP5 families), suggesting high metabolic activity in healthy neurons. In contrast, AD neurons showed downregulation of neurodegeneration-associated genes and upregulation of stress/chaperone responses (e.g., HSPA1A, HSP90AA1, DNAJA1), indicating a shift toward cellular stress adaptation (<keyFinding priority='2'>AD excitatory neurons upregulate stress/chaperone pathways</keyFinding><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Excitatory Neuron Subtypes and Disease Associations**  
Six neuronal subclusters (n1–n6) were identified. Subclustering and projection onto reference datasets (Lake et al., 2016) mapped n2 to a mixture of Ex1–7 (layer II–VI) excitatory neurons, while n1 and n6 contained a mix of excitatory and inhibitory neurons but segregated by disease status.

- **n1 (AD-enriched subcluster):**  
  - Contains mostly AD neurons, mapped to Ex3 (layer IV) excitatory neurons and some interneurons.
  - Enriched for autophagy, responses to hormones, lipids, and misfolded proteins.
  - Upregulation of genes involved in stress response and autophagy (e.g., HSPA1A, HSP90AA1, DNAJA1, BIN1).
  - Downregulation of synaptic transmission genes (e.g., SNAP25, RIMS1).
  - Shows increased expression of AD GWAS genes such as BIN1 and ADARB2 (<keyFinding priority='1'>n1 subcluster is an AD-specific excitatory neuron state with upregulated autophagy/stress pathways and BIN1</keyFinding><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

- **n2 (mixed, mostly control):**  
  - Corresponds to a range of excitatory neuron types (Ex1–7).
  - Largely homeostatic, with preserved synaptic and metabolic gene expression.

- **n6 (control-enriched):**  
  - Contains mostly control neurons, mapped to Ex3 and deep-layer interneurons.
  - Enriched for ribosomal and oxidative phosphorylation pathways, indicating high energy demand and protein synthesis.
  - Downregulation of stress response genes compared to n1.

Other subclusters (n3–n5) mapped to various interneuron types and are less relevant for excitatory neuron-specific findings.

**Disease Progression and Trajectories**  
Pseudotime and trajectory analyses suggest that n6 (homeostatic, metabolically active) neurons may transition toward n1 (AD, stress-adapted) states in disease, characterized by loss of synaptic gene expression and increased stress/autophagy signatures (<keyFinding priority='2'>Trajectory from homeostatic (n6) to AD (n1) excitatory neuron states involves loss of synaptic function and gain of stress responses</keyFinding><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Genetic Modulators and GWAS Integration**  
Several AD GWAS genes (e.g., BIN1, ADARB2, NPAS3) were upregulated specifically in the n1 AD subcluster. Regulatory network analysis identified HIF3A as a key transcription factor driving transitions from n6 to n1, regulating multiple AD GWAS genes in excitatory neurons (<keyFinding priority='1'>HIF3A regulates AD GWAS genes in the transition to AD-specific excitatory neuron states</keyFinding><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Comparison with Other Studies**  
Comparison with Mathys et al. (2019) showed high concordance (>90%) in the direction of differentially expressed genes in excitatory neurons, despite differences in brain region and cohort (<keyFinding priority='3'>High cross-study concordance for excitatory neuron DEGs</keyFinding><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

</findings>

<clinical>
Excitatory neurons in the entorhinal cortex exhibit pronounced transcriptional reprogramming in AD, with a shift from homeostatic, metabolically active states (n6) to disease-associated, stress-adapted states (n1). This transition is marked by loss of synaptic gene expression and upregulation of autophagy and chaperone pathways, potentially reflecting attempts to mitigate proteotoxic stress. The n1 subcluster is enriched for AD GWAS genes (notably BIN1), implicating these neurons in genetic susceptibility to AD. HIF3A emerges as a potential regulator of this transition, linking genetic risk to cell state changes. These findings suggest that excitatory neuron dysfunction in AD is driven by both loss of synaptic integrity and maladaptive stress responses, with possible implications for targeting autophagy or synaptic maintenance therapeutically. However, all associations are correlative, and causal relationships remain to be established.
</clinical>

---

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**  
This study identifies distinct excitatory neuron subtypes in the human entorhinal cortex, revealing that Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is associated with a shift from homeostatic, metabolically active neurons (n6) to a disease-specific, stress-adapted state (n1) characterized by loss of synaptic gene expression and upregulation of autophagy/chaperone pathways. The n1 subcluster is enriched for AD GWAS genes such as BIN1, and the transition is potentially regulated by HIF3A. These findings highlight cell-intrinsic and genetic drivers of excitatory neuron vulnerability in AD.

---

**Research Implications (≈150 words):**  
This work provides a detailed map of excitatory neuron heterogeneity and disease-associated state transitions in the AD entorhinal cortex. The identification of a specific AD-associated excitatory neuron subcluster (n1) with upregulated stress and autophagy pathways, and enrichment for GWAS risk genes (e.g., BIN1), offers a framework for dissecting the molecular underpinnings of neuronal vulnerability. The regulatory role of HIF3A in driving these transitions suggests new avenues for mechanistic and therapeutic studies. The findings are largely concordant with prior single-nucleus studies (e.g., Mathys et al.), supporting the robustness of these disease signatures across brain regions. Open questions remain regarding the causal role of these transcriptional changes in neurodegeneration, the functional consequences of BIN1 and other GWAS gene upregulation in excitatory neurons, and whether similar transitions occur in other cortical regions or at earlier disease stages. Future work should integrate spatial, longitudinal, and functional validation to clarify these trajectories and their relevance to AD progression.

# summary for Herrero 2020 (excitatory neurons)

**Quick Reference (≈100 words)**  
Herrero et al. (2020, Molecular Autism) used single-nucleus RNA-seq of postmortem human amygdala to show that excitatory neurons are the principal cell type exhibiting altered expression of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) susceptibility genes in ASD cases. Among 271 ASD-linked genes expressed in developing amygdala, seven (notably including KCNQ3, PHF21A, ELP4, CNKSR2, RANBP17, NAV2) were dysregulated in ASD, with most changes concentrated in excitatory neuron clusters. These findings suggest that genetic risk for ASD converges on amygdala excitatory neurons during postnatal development, with some evidence for dynamic, age-dependent expression.

Disease focus: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
</metadata>

<methods>
The study combined cross-species transcriptomic mining and single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) to identify ASD susceptibility genes expressed in the amygdala during development.  
- snRNA-seq was performed on microdissected amygdala tissue from five ASD and five matched control postmortem human brains (ages 4–20 years).  
- Cell type annotation was based on marker gene expression.  
- Differential gene expression was assessed using MAST, controlling for diagnosis, age, sex, RIN, and postmortem interval.  
- Cross-referencing with mouse developmental atlases (Allen Brain Atlas) and human developmental data (BrainSpan) provided spatial and temporal context.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions:**  
The snRNA-seq dataset identified 15 cell clusters, including multiple excitatory neuron subtypes (AmExN-1 to AmExN-6), interneurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocyte lineage cells, microglia, and endothelial cells. The study does not report significant changes in the overall proportion of excitatory neurons between ASD and controls.

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
Excitatory neurons were subdivided into at least six clusters (AmExN-1 to AmExN-6), based on marker gene expression (e.g., RBFOX3, THY1). The main focus was on AmExN-5 (C10), which showed the highest enrichment for ASD gene dysregulation.

- **AmExN-5 (Excitatory neurons):**  
  - **Defining markers:** RBFOX3, THY1 (general excitatory neuron markers); cluster-specific markers not detailed.
  - **Key dysregulated genes in ASD:** KCNQ3, PHF21A, ELP4, CNKSR2, RANBP17 (all up- or downregulated; directionality shown in violin plots, but not always specified in text).
  - **Functional signature:** These genes are involved in neuronal excitability (KCNQ3), chromatin regulation (PHF21A), transcriptional elongation (ELP4), synaptic scaffolding (CNKSR2), and nuclear transport (RANBP17).
  - **Disease association:** All five genes are ASD susceptibility genes expressed in both human and mouse amygdala during development. Their dysregulation is specific to excitatory neurons in ASD cases.
  - **Quantitative changes:** The study reports significant differential expression (≥10% change, FDR < 0.05) for these genes in AmExN-5 in ASD vs. controls.
  - <keyFinding priority='1'>Excitatory neuron cluster AmExN-5 is the principal locus of ASD gene dysregulation in the amygdala, with multiple high-confidence ASD risk genes altered in ASD cases.</keyFinding>

  <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

- **Other Excitatory Neuron Clusters (AmExN-1 to AmExN-6):**

  - <keyFinding priority='2'>Other excitatory neuron subtypes showed fewer or no significant ASD gene expression changes.</keyFinding>  
  <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>  
  <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression:**  
- Of 271 ASD-linked genes expressed in the developing amygdala, seven were dysregulated in ASD cases: KCNQ3, PHF21A, ELP4, CNKSR2, RANBP17 (in excitatory neurons), and GFAP, NAV2 (in fibrous astrocytes).
- The majority of differentially expressed genes in ASD were found in excitatory neurons, with a smaller subset in astrocytes and other cell types.
- <keyFinding priority='1'>Dysregulation of multiple ASD risk genes is highly cell-type specific, with a strong bias toward excitatory neurons.</keyFinding>  
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>  
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Pathway Enrichment:**  
- The 80 cross-species validated ASD-amygdala genes are enriched for pathways including glutamatergic synaptic transmission, dendritic spine development, axonogenesis, and Wnt signaling.
- <keyFinding priority='2'>Pathways implicated in excitatory neuron development and synaptic function are overrepresented among ASD risk genes expressed in the amygdala.</keyFinding>  
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>  
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
- The study notes that ASD risk gene expression in the amygdala is dynamic across development, with higher variance than background genes, suggesting temporal regulation during the ASD-susceptible window (fetal to early postnatal).
- However, the snRNA-seq data are from postnatal tissue (ages 4–20), so direct inference about fetal trajectories is limited.
- <keyFinding priority='2'>ASD risk gene expression in the amygdala is temporally dynamic, with potential implications for critical periods of vulnerability.</keyFinding>  
<confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>  
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
- No significant associations with sex, age, or other host factors are reported for excitatory neuron gene dysregulation, likely due to limited sample size.

**Spatial Analysis:**  
- Cross-referencing with the Allen Mouse Brain Atlas shows that most dysregulated genes in human ASD amygdala are also expressed in mouse basolateral amygdala nuclei, supporting evolutionary conservation.

**Gene Regulatory Networks:**  
- Some dysregulated genes (e.g., PHF21A, ELP4) are involved in chromatin remodeling and transcriptional regulation, suggesting possible upstream effects on broader gene networks.

**Cell-Cell Communication:**  
- Not directly addressed for excitatory neurons in this study.

The findings implicate amygdala excitatory neurons as a key cellular substrate for ASD genetic risk, with dysregulation of multiple high-confidence ASD genes in this cell type in postnatal ASD cases. This supports the hypothesis that altered excitatory neuron function in the amygdala may contribute to social and behavioral phenotypes in ASD. The cell-type specificity of gene dysregulation highlights potential targets for therapeutic intervention or biomarker development, though causality cannot be established from cross-sectional, postmortem data.

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**  
This study provides evidence that ASD genetic risk converges on amygdala excitatory neurons, with a subset of high-confidence ASD genes showing cell-type-specific dysregulation in postnatal ASD brains. The identified genes (e.g., KCNQ3, PHF21A, ELP4, CNKSR2, RANBP17) are involved in neuronal excitability, chromatin regulation, and synaptic scaffolding, aligning with known mechanisms of excitatory/inhibitory imbalance in ASD. The findings are consistent with prior models implicating cortical excitatory neurons but extend this to the amygdala, a region critical for social behavior. However, the study is limited by small sample size and postnatal age range, and cannot resolve whether observed changes are causal or compensatory. Future work should validate these findings in larger, developmentally diverse cohorts and explore functional consequences of excitatory neuron dysregulation. The study does not report explicit contradictions with prior data, but notes that region-specific expression of ASD genes is not observed, suggesting that cell-type, rather than regional, specificity may underlie ASD vulnerability in the amygdala.

# summary for Hoffman 2023 (excitatory neurons)

1) **Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This study introduces *dreamlet*, a scalable pseudobulk differential expression tool, and applies it to a novel single-nucleus RNA-seq dataset from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) of 150 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) cases and 149 controls, profiling 1.4 million nuclei. Eight excitatory neuron subtypes were identified, each with distinct gene expression signatures. Disease-associated changes in excitatory neurons included upregulation of synapse assembly and glutamate signaling pathways, with some genes (e.g., PDE10A) showing broad downregulation across multiple excitatory subtypes in AD. The number and reproducibility of differentially expressed genes in excitatory neurons were strongly influenced by the number of nuclei per subject and technical batch effects.

Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
</metadata>

<methods>
The study presents *dreamlet*, an R package for efficient, scalable pseudobulk differential expression analysis using precision-weighted linear mixed models. The method was applied to single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) data from DLPFC of 299 postmortem donors (150 AD, 149 controls), with 1.4 million nuclei profiled. Nuclei were multiplexed using hashing, and technical replicates were generated. Cell type annotation identified 22 clusters, including 8 excitatory neuron subtypes. Differential expression was modeled at the pseudobulk level, accounting for technical and biological replicates, batch effects, and sequencing depth.  
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Identification:**  
Eight excitatory neuron subtypes were identified in the DLPFC dataset, labeled as EN_L2_3_IT, EN_L3_5_IT_1, EN_L3_5_IT_2, EN_L5_6_NP, EN_L5_6_CT, EN_L6_IT, EN_NF, and EN_L6_CT. These subtypes were defined based on established marker genes and clustering in UMAP space, consistent with prior cortical taxonomy. The study does not provide detailed marker gene lists for each excitatory subtype in the main text, but references expert curation and machine learning-based annotation using known signatures from the Human Cell Atlas.  
<keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
The identification of eight excitatory neuron subtypes in human DLPFC aligns with established cortical neuron taxonomy, supporting the robustness of the clustering and annotation approach.
</keyFinding>

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment:**  
The number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between AD and controls varied widely across cell types and was strongly dependent on the number of nuclei per subject for each cluster. For excitatory neurons, many DEGs were shared across multiple subtypes, while some showed subtype specificity.  
<keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
PDE10A was significantly downregulated in AD across 12 of 14 neuronal subtypes, including all major excitatory neuron clusters, indicating a broad neuronal response to AD pathology.
</keyFinding>

Gene set analysis using the full spectrum of test statistics revealed upregulation of synapse assembly and glutamate signaling pathways in subsets of excitatory and inhibitory neurons in AD. Specifically, synaptic vesicle endocytosis was most strongly upregulated in the EN_L2_3_IT subtype, and neuronal action potential pathways were most upregulated in the IN_PVALB inhibitory neuron subtype.  
<keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
These pathway-level changes suggest altered synaptic function and neurotransmission in excitatory neurons in AD, consistent with known disease mechanisms.
</keyFinding>

**Cell Subtype Characterization:**  
While the main text does not provide exhaustive marker gene lists for each excitatory neuron subtype, the clustering and annotation approach is based on established markers and cortical layer identity. The EN_L2_3_IT subtype, for example, is associated with layer 2/3 intratelencephalic projection neurons, while EN_L5_6_CT and EN_L5_6_NP correspond to deeper layer corticothalamic and near-projecting neurons, respectively.  
<keyFinding priority='3'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
The study confirms the presence of both homeostatic and disease-associated excitatory neuron subtypes, but does not report dramatic shifts in subtype proportions between AD and controls.
</keyFinding>

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
The reproducibility and number of DEGs detected in excitatory neurons were strongly influenced by the average number of nuclei per subject in each cluster. Clusters with more nuclei per subject showed higher concordance across technical replicates and greater power to detect DEGs. Technical batch effects (sample pool) explained substantial variance for some genes, and were correlated with gene GC content, indicating PCR-related artifacts.  
<keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
Accounting for technical batch effects and increasing nuclei per subject are critical for robust detection of disease-associated changes in excitatory neurons.
</keyFinding>

**Gene Regulatory Networks and Cell-Cell Communication:**  
The study does not report specific gene regulatory network or ligand-receptor analyses for excitatory neurons.

**Spatial Analysis:**  
No spatial transcriptomics or in situ validation is reported for excitatory neuron subtypes in this study.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
The analysis is cross-sectional, comparing AD cases and controls, without explicit pseudotime or trajectory modeling for excitatory neuron subtypes. However, the broad downregulation of PDE10A and upregulation of synaptic pathways in AD suggest disease-stage associated transcriptional changes.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
No direct integration with genetic risk variants or multi-omic data is reported for excitatory neuron subtypes in this study.

</findings>

<clinical>
Excitatory neurons in the DLPFC show disease-associated transcriptional changes in AD, including broad downregulation of PDE10A and upregulation of synaptic assembly and glutamate signaling pathways in specific subtypes. These findings suggest altered excitatory neurotransmission and synaptic remodeling in AD, which may contribute to cognitive decline. However, the study emphasizes that the detection of cell type-specific DEGs is highly sensitive to technical factors, such as nuclei number and batch effects, and that some apparent specificity may reflect limited power in other clusters rather than true biological restriction. The results highlight the need for careful interpretation of cell type-specific findings and suggest that excitatory neuron subtypes may serve as potential targets for further mechanistic or therapeutic studies in AD.
</clinical>

---

3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study demonstrates that large-scale snRNA-seq with robust statistical modeling can resolve multiple excitatory neuron subtypes in human cortex and detect disease-associated transcriptional changes in AD. The broad downregulation of PDE10A across excitatory neurons and upregulation of synaptic pathways in specific subtypes are consistent with known models of synaptic dysfunction in AD, but the study does not report novel excitatory neuron states or dramatic shifts in subtype proportions. The findings align with established cortical taxonomy and previously reported neuronal vulnerability in AD. However, the authors caution that technical factors, especially nuclei number and batch effects, can strongly influence DEG detection and apparent cell type specificity. Open questions remain regarding the functional consequences of these transcriptional changes, their relationship to disease progression, and whether finer-grained excitatory neuron states exist in AD. Future studies integrating spatial, genetic, and multi-omic data, as well as longitudinal sampling, will be needed to clarify the roles of excitatory neuron subtypes in AD pathogenesis and to distinguish true biological specificity from technical artifacts.

# summary for Hoffman 2024 (excitatory neurons)

**Quick Reference (Excitatory Neurons):**

This large-scale single-nucleus RNA-seq study of 5.6 million nuclei from 1,384 diverse human donors provides a high-resolution atlas of cell-type-specific genetic regulation in the prefrontal cortex. Excitatory neurons (EN) exhibit the greatest number of eGenes and dynamic eQTLs, with subclass-specific regulatory effects and disease associations—such as CNTN4 regulation in layer 6 corticothalamic neurons linked to schizophrenia risk. Age, cell abundance, and genetic ancestry modulate these findings, highlighting the complexity of excitatory neuron regulation in brain disorders.

</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) was performed on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) tissue from 1,384 donors (35.6% non-European ancestry), yielding 5.6 million nuclei. Nuclei were annotated into 8 major cell classes and 27 subclasses, including multiple excitatory neuron subtypes. eQTL mapping, Bayesian meta-analysis, colocalization with GWAS, and dynamic eQTL analysis across developmental pseudotime were performed. Validation included chromatin accessibility enrichment and comparison to bulk and other single-nucleus datasets.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Subtypes:**  
Excitatory neurons (EN) were the most abundant class, enabling detection of 10,913 eGenes at the class level and up to 8,812 eGenes in the EN_L2_3_IT subclass. Subclasses included layer-specific populations (e.g., EN_L2_3_IT, EN_L5_6_NP, EN_L6_CT, EN_L6B), each with distinct regulatory profiles. The number of eGenes correlated strongly with cell abundance and read depth, reflecting both biological and technical factors.

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment:**  
EN subclasses displayed unique sets of eGenes and regulatory variants, many of which were not detectable in bulk tissue or at the broader class level.

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
At the subclass level, excitatory neurons were divided into multiple populations based on cortical layer and projection type (e.g., EN_L2_3_IT, EN_L5_6_NP, EN_L6_CT, EN_L6B). Each subtype was defined by canonical marker genes (not exhaustively listed in the main text, but likely including SLC17A7, SATB2, CUX2, RORB, FEZF2, etc., as per standard nomenclature).  
- EN_L6_CT (layer 6 corticothalamic): Notably, CNTN4 eQTLs colocalized with schizophrenia risk only in this subtype, not in broader EN classes or other subclasses.  
- EN_L2_3_IT and EN_L5_6_NP: Showed the highest number of eGenes, reflecting both abundance and regulatory complexity.  
- EN_L6B: Had the fewest eGenes among EN subclasses, possibly due to lower abundance or expression diversity.

**Gene Regulatory Networks and Cell-Cell Communication:**  
While the main focus was on eQTLs, the study also identified trans-eQTLs and regulatory hubs, but these were less prominent in EN compared to glial cells. No major ligand-receptor findings specific to EN were highlighted.

**Spatial Analysis:**  
No direct spatial transcriptomics or in situ validation for EN subtypes was reported, but chromatin accessibility enrichment supported the cell-type specificity of regulatory variants.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
Dynamic eQTL analysis across a pseudotime trajectory (age 0–97) revealed 1,364 genes in EN with regulatory effects that change over development and aging. For example, the effect of rs1878289 on NGEF expression increased during neuronal maturation.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
Colocalization with GWAS identified EN-specific regulatory signals for schizophrenia (e.g., CNTN4 in EN_L6_CT), and for other disorders at the class level (e.g., ACE, FURIN, DRD2, PTPRU, MLF2, FMA171A1). However, for Alzheimer’s disease, neuronal eQTLs were less prominent than those in microglia, astrocytes, or oligodendrocytes.

</findings>

<clinical>
Excitatory neurons are strongly implicated in the genetic architecture of neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly schizophrenia, where subclass-specific regulatory effects (e.g., CNTN4 in EN_L6_CT) may underlie disease risk. The lack of strong EN-specific signals for Alzheimer’s disease suggests a lesser direct role in neurodegeneration compared to glia. The identification of dynamic eQTLs in EN highlights the importance of developmental timing in disease susceptibility, suggesting that genetic risk may be exerted during specific windows of neuronal maturation. These findings may inform future therapeutic strategies targeting excitatory neuron subtypes or developmental stages in psychiatric disorders.
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications**

This study establishes a foundational resource for cell-type and subtype-specific genetic regulation in the human brain, with excitatory neurons displaying the greatest regulatory diversity and dynamic modulation. The alignment of EN subtypes with established cortical layer and projection-type nomenclature supports the robustness of the classification. The discovery that disease-associated regulatory effects (e.g., for schizophrenia) are confined to specific EN subtypes (such as EN_L6_CT) challenges bulk tissue and class-level analyses, which may obscure critical disease mechanisms. Open questions remain regarding the functional consequences of these regulatory variants, the precise developmental windows of vulnerability, and the interplay between EN and glial cells in disease. The study’s findings are largely concordant with prior models of neuronal involvement in psychiatric disorders, but the explicit demonstration of subtype specificity and developmental dynamics represents a significant advance. Future work integrating spatial transcriptomics, functional validation, and multi-omic data will be essential to translate these regulatory insights into mechanistic understanding and therapeutic targets.

# summary for Is 2024 (excitatory neurons)

<quickReference>
Excitatory neurons in this study were divided into 14 transcriptionally distinct clusters, with cluster 23 (cl.23) showing a significant reduction in proportion in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brains. This reduction was associated with higher Braak stage, Thal phase, and APOEε4 genotype. While the main focus of the paper is on vascular and astrocytic cells, excitatory neuron cl.23 stands out as the only neuronal cluster with robust disease and genetic associations, suggesting selective vulnerability. No major disease-associated transcriptional subtypes or state transitions were reported for excitatory neurons beyond these proportional changes.

<detailedSummary>
<metadata>
Is et al., 2024, Nature Communications. Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease.
</metadata>
<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on temporal cortex tissue from 12 AD and 12 age- and sex-matched controls. The study used a nuclei isolation protocol optimized for high purity and detection of rare cell types, followed by 10x Genomics Chromium platform sequencing. Cell type annotation was based on established marker genes and clustering.
</methods>

<findings>
The study identified 14 excitatory neuronal clusters, comprising 41% of all nuclei sequenced. These clusters were annotated using canonical markers (e.g., SLC17A7, NRGN) and were well separated in UMAP space, indicating transcriptional heterogeneity among excitatory neurons.

**Cell Type Proportions and Disease Association:**  
Among all excitatory neuron clusters, cluster 23 (cl.23) exhibited a statistically significant reduction in its proportion in AD brains compared to controls. This decrease was also negatively associated with Braak stage (neurofibrillary tangle burden), Thal phase (amyloid plaque burden), and APOEε4 genotype. No other excitatory neuron clusters showed significant proportional changes with disease, age, sex, or APOE genotype.

**Subtype Characterization:**  
The paper does not provide detailed molecular or functional characterization (e.g., marker genes, pathway enrichment, or spatial localization) for individual excitatory neuron clusters, including cl.23. The clusters were defined by unsupervised clustering and canonical marker expression, but no further subdivision into disease-associated or homeostatic states was reported for excitatory neurons.  
<keyFinding priority='2'>No distinct disease-associated transcriptional states or subtypes were identified within excitatory neurons beyond the proportional loss of cl.23.</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathways:**  
The main focus of the paper’s differential expression and pathway analyses was on vascular and astrocytic clusters. For excitatory neurons, the study does not report cluster-specific differentially expressed genes (DEGs) or pathway enrichment results in AD versus control. There is no mention of excitatory neuron-specific up- or down-regulated genes, nor of functional signatures (e.g., synaptic, metabolic, or stress-response pathways) for cl.23 or other clusters.

**Modulators and Metrics:**  
The reduction in cl.23 is modulated by APOEε4 genotype, Braak stage, and Thal phase, suggesting that both genetic and pathological factors contribute to the vulnerability of this excitatory neuron subpopulation. No quantitative activation or morphology scores were reported for excitatory neurons.

**Spatial/Morphological Validation:**  
No spatial transcriptomics, immunostaining, or in situ hybridization validation was performed for excitatory neuron subtypes or for cl.23 specifically.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
No pseudotime or trajectory analysis was performed for excitatory neurons. The only temporal/disease progression insight is the negative association of cl.23 proportion with Braak and Thal stages.

**Gene Regulatory Networks, Cell-Cell Communication, and Multi-omic Integration:**  
The study does not report gene regulatory network analysis, ligand-receptor interactions, or integration with genetic risk variants for excitatory neuron clusters.

**Summary of Negative Findings:**  
Overall, the study reports minimal findings for excitatory neurons beyond the proportional loss of cl.23. There is no evidence for major disease-associated transcriptional reprogramming, emergence of novel excitatory neuron states, or functional pathway shifts in AD for this cell type.
</findings>

<clinical>
The main disease relevance for excitatory neurons in this study is the selective vulnerability of cl.23, which is depleted in AD and in association with APOEε4 and higher pathological burden. This suggests that specific excitatory neuron subpopulations may be preferentially lost or dysfunctional in AD, potentially contributing to cognitive decline. However, the lack of molecular or functional characterization of cl.23 limits mechanistic insight. No therapeutic or biomarker implications are proposed for excitatory neurons in this paper.
</clinical>
</detailedSummary>

<researchImplications>
The identification of a selectively vulnerable excitatory neuron cluster (cl.23) in the temporal cortex, associated with both AD pathology and APOEε4 genotype, raises important questions about the molecular identity and functional role of this subpopulation. Future studies should aim to characterize the marker genes, projection patterns, and functional properties of cl.23, and to determine whether its loss is a driver or consequence of AD pathology. The absence of disease-associated transcriptional states or stress signatures in excitatory neurons in this dataset contrasts with some prior reports of neuronal vulnerability and reprogramming in AD, suggesting possible region-specific or methodological differences. The findings highlight the need for deeper molecular and spatial profiling of excitatory neuron subtypes in AD, and for integration with functional and longitudinal data to clarify their role in disease progression.
<contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>
The authors note that, unlike some previous single-nucleus studies that reported transcriptional reprogramming or stress-response states in excitatory neurons in AD, their dataset did not reveal such changes, possibly due to differences in brain region, sample size, or analytical focus.

**Detailed Summary**

<findings>
The primary aim of this study was to dissect oligodendrocyte lineage heterogeneity in human white matter in the context of multiple sclerosis (MS), using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq). However, the dataset also included neuronal populations, allowing for the assessment of excitatory neuron diversity and potential disease-associated changes.

**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Identification**

The authors identified five neuronal subclusters in their integrated analysis of control and MS white matter (WM) (see main text and Figure 1a). These neuronal clusters were annotated based on canonical neuronal markers (e.g., SNAP25, GABRB2; Figure 1g), but the manuscript does not provide further subdivision or detailed characterization of excitatory neuron subtypes. The focus of the clustering and subsequent analyses was on oligodendroglial populations, with neurons serving primarily as a reference for cell type diversity.

Quantitative analysis of cell type proportions (Figure 2b) shows that the relative abundance of neurons, including excitatory neurons, was similar between control and MS samples. There is no evidence of significant loss, gain, or redistribution of neuronal subtypes in MS lesions or NAWM compared to controls. <keyFinding priority='3'>Excitatory neuron proportions remain stable across disease states and lesion types in this dataset.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Analysis**

**Cell Subtype Characterization**

While five neuronal subclusters were identified, the manuscript does not provide further granularity regarding excitatory neuron subtypes (e.g., layer-specific, projection-specific, or disease-associated states). Marker gene expression for neurons was used primarily for cluster annotation (e.g., SNAP25 for neurons in general), and there is no evidence of disease-associated excitatory neuron subpopulations or altered states. <keyFinding priority='3'>No distinct excitatory neuron subtypes with disease-specific signatures were reported.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**

The spatial and morphological validation experiments (IHC, ISH) were directed at oligodendrocyte lineage markers and did not include excitatory neuron markers. Thus, there is no spatial or morphological evidence for altered excitatory neuron states in MS in this study.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories and Modulators**

The study does not report pseudotime or trajectory analyses for neurons, nor does it discuss the influence of age, sex, or genetic risk factors on excitatory neuron states. All such analyses were restricted to oligodendrocyte lineage cells.

**Gene Regulatory Networks and Cell-Cell Communication**

No gene regulatory network or ligand-receptor analyses involving excitatory neurons are presented. The focus is on oligodendrocyte-microglia interactions and immune oligodendroglia.

**Contradictions or Departures from Prior Data**

The study provides no evidence for a disease-specific role of excitatory neurons in MS white matter pathology.

---

**Research Implications**

The absence of significant findings for excitatory neurons in this study highlights the cell-type specificity of MS pathology in white matter, with oligodendrocyte lineage cells showing the most pronounced disease-associated heterogeneity. This result is consistent with the established view that MS is primarily a demyelinating and glial-driven disease, at least in the white matter. The lack of excitatory neuron subtype diversity or disease-associated states in this dataset may reflect technical limitations (e.g., lower neuronal yield in white matter snRNA-seq), regional specificity, or true biological resilience of these neurons in MS lesions.

Future studies could address whether excitatory neuron subtypes in gray matter or cortical regions show more pronounced changes in MS, or whether more sensitive methods (e.g., spatial transcriptomics, electrophysiology) might reveal subtle functional alterations not captured by snRNA-seq. The findings here align with prior models emphasizing glial, rather than neuronal, drivers of white matter pathology in MS. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

# summary for Johansen 2023 (excitatory neurons)

1) **Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This large-scale snRNA-seq study of 75 adult human cortical samples reveals that excitatory neurons, especially deep-layer glutamatergic subtypes (e.g., L5 ET, L6 IT, L6b), exhibit the greatest interindividual variability in both gene expression and abundance among all major brain cell classes. Key marker genes such as SLC17A7, LRRC37A, and KDM1B show high donor-associated variability, with genetic factors (notably MAPT locus haplotypes) and demographic variables (age, sex, ancestry) contributing to this heterogeneity. Deep-layer excitatory neuron subtypes are particularly enriched for cell type–specific eQTLs, highlighting their sensitivity to genetic background and potential relevance to neurodegenerative disease risk.

</metadata>

<methods>
This study employed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) on cortical tissue from 75 adult neurosurgical donors (epilepsy and tumor cases), primarily sampling the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) and frontal cortex. Nearly 400,000 nuclei were profiled and mapped to a reference taxonomy of 125 robust cell types, including all major excitatory neuron subtypes. Quality control included iterative clustering, marker-based annotation, and removal of low-quality/doublet nuclei. Cell type assignments were cross-validated with a neurotypical postmortem reference. eQTL analysis was performed using matched WGS data.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Excitatory neurons (glutamatergic) constitute the majority of cortical neurons and were subdivided into multiple subtypes based on laminar identity and projection class: L2/3 IT, L4 IT, L5 IT, L5 ET, L5/6 NP, L6 IT, L6 IT Car3, L6 CT, and L6b. Among these, deep-layer subtypes (L5 ET, L6 IT, L6b) showed the highest interindividual variability in both abundance and gene expression. For example, L5 ET neurons were less abundant in tumor cases (FDR < 0.01), and regional differences (frontal vs. temporal cortex) also influenced subtype proportions. However, broad excitatory-inhibitory (E-I) ratio did not differ significantly by disease, sex, or region.

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
Each excitatory neuron subtype was defined by canonical marker genes:
- L2/3 IT: SLC17A7, CUX2 (superficial markers)
- L4 IT: RORB
- L5 IT: FEZF2, BCL11B
- L5 ET: FEZF2, TLE4, CTIP2 (projection markers)
- L6 IT: TLE4, FOXP2
- L6b: COL19A1, KCNIP4, ND3, HIPK1, GRB2, LRRC37A

Deep-layer subtypes (L5 ET, L6 IT, L6b) were particularly variable across donors, with L6b showing the highest donor-associated gene expression variance (>20% for many genes). These subtypes also harbored the greatest number of cell type–specific eQTLs, with L6b and L6 IT Car3 showing hundreds to thousands of significant cis-eQTLs.

**Differential Gene Expression & Pathway Enrichment:**  
Genes with high interindividual variability in excitatory neurons included:
- LRRC37A and LRRC37A2 (MAPT locus, chromosome 17q21.31)
- KDM1B (notably in L6b)
- SLC26A3, MAML3, ASTN2, PARG, FAF2, ARL17B
- Immediate early genes (FOS, JUN, JUND) showed higher expression in neurosurgical vs. postmortem tissue, likely reflecting acute stress.

Gene ontology enrichment for variable genes in excitatory neurons highlighted synaptic signaling, cell adhesion, and membrane-related processes. Deep-layer subtypes were also enriched for genes involved in neuronal projection and chromatin remodeling (e.g., ARID2).

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
Donor characteristics (age, sex, ancestry, disease state) explained a minority of the observed variance, with most gene expression heterogeneity remaining unexplained ("residual"). Sex chromosome genes (XIST, UTY, TTTY14) contributed to sex-specific variance. Age was associated with decreased OPC abundance but did not strongly affect excitatory neuron proportions. Genetic background, especially MAPT haplotype (H1/H2), modulated LRRC37A expression in deep-layer excitatory neurons.

**Gene Regulatory Networks & eQTLs:**  
Deep-layer excitatory neurons were highly enriched for cell type–specific cis-eQTLs, with many eGenes mapping to the MAPT locus (LRRC37A2, ARL17B). These eQTLs were often shared across excitatory subtypes but not glia, suggesting neuron-specific regulatory effects. The number of detected eQTLs increased with cell number per subtype, saturating above ~15,000 nuclei.

**Cell-Cell Communication & Spatial Analysis:**  
No direct ligand-receptor or spatial transcriptomic validation was reported for excitatory neuron subtypes in this study, but the authors note that robust marker sets identified here could be used for future spatial mapping.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
Comparison with aged and demented donors (SEA-AD cohort) showed that dementia was associated with increased variability in excitatory neuron abundance and gene expression, but the most variable genes in adult neurosurgical tissue (e.g., immediate early genes) were not the same as those in aged/demented brains. This suggests that acute surgical stress and chronic neurodegeneration drive distinct transcriptional responses.

<clinical>
Excitatory neuron subtypes, especially those in deep cortical layers, are highly sensitive to interindividual genetic and demographic variation. The strong association of MAPT locus genes (LRRC37A, LRRC37A2) with deep-layer excitatory neuron expression suggests a potential mechanism by which genetic risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases (e.g., tauopathies) may exert cell type–specific effects. The enrichment of cell type–specific eQTLs in these neurons provides a framework for linking GWAS risk loci to functional consequences in defined neuronal populations. While most findings are associative, the data imply that deep-layer excitatory neurons may be particularly vulnerable or responsive to genetic and environmental insults relevant to neurodegeneration and aging.

3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study establishes a comprehensive baseline for interindividual variation in human cortical excitatory neuron subtypes, revealing that deep-layer glutamatergic neurons are the most variable both in abundance and gene expression. The identification of highly donor-variable genes at the MAPT locus (LRRC37A, LRRC37A2) and the enrichment of cell type–specific eQTLs in these subtypes provide a critical resource for interpreting genetic risk in neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders. The findings align with, but also extend, previous models by demonstrating that deep-layer rather than superficial excitatory neurons are the principal source of interindividual transcriptomic heterogeneity in adult cortex. Open questions remain regarding the functional consequences of this variability, the impact of rare cell states, and the extent to which acute surgical stress versus chronic disease drives observed gene expression changes. Future studies integrating spatial transcriptomics, longitudinal sampling, and functional assays will be essential to resolve these issues and to link genetic risk to excitatory neuron dysfunction in disease.

<contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>
The authors note that, contrary to some prior studies emphasizing variability in superficial (L2/3) excitatory neurons, their data show that deep-layer subtypes (L5 ET, L6 IT, L6b) are the most variable in adults. This represents a refinement of previous models and is explicitly discussed in the paper.

Kamath T, Abdulraouf A, Burris SJ, Langlieb J, Gazestani V, Nadaf NM, Balderrama K, Vanderburg C, Macosko EZ. (2022). "Single-cell genomic profiling of human dopamine neurons identifies a population that selectively degenerates in Parkinson’s disease." Nature Neuroscience 25, 588–595. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-022-01061-1
Disease focus: Parkinson’s disease (PD)
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) was performed on postmortem human substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) tissue from PD/Lewy body dementia (LBD) patients and matched controls. A protocol using NR4A2-based FANS was developed to enrich for dopamine (DA) neuron nuclei, but all major cell types were profiled. Spatial transcriptomics (Slide-seq) and single-molecule FISH (smFISH) were used for spatial and morphological validation.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions & General Overview**  
Excitatory neurons in the SNpc are not the primary focus of this study; the main excitatory population profiled and analyzed in depth are the midbrain dopaminergic (DA) neurons. However, the dataset includes all major cell types, including non-DA excitatory neurons, inhibitory neurons, oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, microglia, endothelial cells, and OPCs. The most dramatic disease-associated changes in cell abundance were observed in DA neurons, with a significant decline in PD/LBD, while other neuronal classes, including excitatory neurons, did not show major proportional changes.

**Excitatory Neuron Subtypes in SNpc**  
The paper does not provide a detailed molecular taxonomy or subtype breakdown for non-dopaminergic excitatory neurons in the SNpc. The main focus is on DA neuron subtypes, which are a specialized class of excitatory neurons. For completeness, the study identifies seven major cell classes in the SNpc, including "non-DA neurons" (which would include excitatory neurons), but does not further subdivide or characterize these non-DA excitatory neurons in terms of marker genes, functional states, or disease associations.

**DA Neuron Subtypes (as Excitatory Neurons)**  
The DA neurons themselves are a specialized excitatory population and are extensively subtyped:
- Ten transcriptionally distinct DA neuron subpopulations were identified.
- Four clusters preferentially expressed SOX6, and six expressed CALB1, recapitulating a developmental axis.
- The most disease-vulnerable subtype is SOX6_AGTR1, marked by SOX6 and AGTR1 expression, highly localized to the ventral tier of the SNpc.
- Other subtypes include CALB1_GEM, CALB1_TRHR, CALB1_CALCR, CALB1_RBP4, CALB1_PPP1R17, SOX6_DDT, SOX6_PART1, SOX6_GFRA2, and CALB1_CRYM_CCDC68, each with distinct marker genes and spatial distributions.
- The SOX6_AGTR1 subtype shows the greatest loss in PD/LBD and is enriched for PD genetic risk loci and upregulation of TP53 and NR2F2 targets, suggesting cell-intrinsic vulnerability pathways.
- CALB1_GEM and CALB1_TRHR subtypes are relatively increased in PD/LBD, possibly reflecting relative resistance.

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**  
- Slide-seq spatial transcriptomics and smFISH confirmed the ventral localization of SOX6_AGTR1 and dorsal localization of CALB1_GEM and CALB1_TRHR.
- smFISH in human tissue validated the selective depletion of SOX6_AGTR1 and relative sparing/increase of CALB1_GEM/TRHR in PD.

**Pathway and Regulatory Analysis**  
- SOX6_AGTR1 cells upregulate TP53 and NR2F2 target genes, implicating stress and cell death pathways.
- Gene ontology analysis highlights regulation of neuron death and Wnt signaling in vulnerable subtypes.
- No major findings are reported for non-DA excitatory neurons regarding pathway enrichment or regulatory networks.

**Genetic and Host Modulators**  
- PD genetic risk is highly enriched in DA neurons, especially SOX6_AGTR1, but not in other cell types.
- No specific modulators (age, sex, genotype) are reported for non-DA excitatory neurons.

**Contradictions/Departures**  
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
The authors do not report explicit contradictions regarding excitatory neuron findings compared to prior literature.
</findings>

<clinical>
The study demonstrates that the most significant disease-associated changes in the SNpc are restricted to a specific DA neuron subtype (SOX6_AGTR1), which is a specialized excitatory neuron. Non-DA excitatory neurons do not show significant proportional or transcriptional changes in PD/LBD. The findings suggest that cell-intrinsic mechanisms, rather than broader excitatory neuron dysfunction, underlie selective vulnerability in PD. The identification of SOX6_AGTR1 as the most vulnerable and genetically at-risk population has implications for targeted therapies and biomarker development, but does not extend to non-DA excitatory neurons.
</clinical>

---

**Quick Reference (≈100 words)**  
This study finds that among excitatory neurons in the human SNpc, only the dopaminergic (DA) subtypes—particularly the SOX6_AGTR1 population—show significant vulnerability and loss in Parkinson’s disease, with strong enrichment for PD genetic risk and upregulation of stress/death pathways (TP53, NR2F2). Non-DA excitatory neurons do not display major disease-associated changes. The SOX6_AGTR1 DA subtype is spatially ventral and highly susceptible, while CALB1_GEM/TRHR subtypes are relatively spared. No significant genetic or demographic modulators are reported for non-DA excitatory neurons.

**Detailed Summary (≈800–1000 words)**

<metadata>
Kamath et al. (2022) present a comprehensive single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomic analysis of the human substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) in Parkinson’s disease (PD), focusing on the molecular taxonomy and disease vulnerability of dopamine (DA) neurons. While the primary focus is on DA neurons, the dataset encompasses all major cell types, including non-DA excitatory neurons.
</metadata>

<methods>
The authors developed a fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting (FANS) protocol using NR4A2 to enrich for DA neuron nuclei from postmortem SNpc tissue, followed by droplet-based snRNA-seq. Both NR4A2-positive and -negative nuclei were sequenced, enabling profiling of all major cell types. Spatial transcriptomics (Slide-seq) and single-molecule FISH (smFISH) were used for spatial and morphological validation of identified subtypes.
</methods>

<findings>
The study’s main findings pertain to DA neurons, a specialized class of excitatory neurons, but the dataset includes non-DA excitatory neurons as well. Seven major cell classes were identified in the SNpc: DA neurons, non-DA neurons (including excitatory and inhibitory), oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, microglia/macrophages, endothelial cells/pericytes, and OPCs.

**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Among all cell types, DA neurons showed the most significant decline in PD/LBD, as measured by both snRNA-seq and smFISH. Non-DA excitatory neurons did not exhibit significant proportional changes in disease, and the study does not report further subtype-specific vulnerability or expansion for these populations.

**DA Neuron Subtypes (Excitatory Neurons):**  
The authors identified ten transcriptionally distinct DA neuron subpopulations using LIGER-based clustering. These subtypes are defined along a SOX6–CALB1 developmental axis, with four SOX6+ and six CALB1+ clusters. Each subtype is characterized by unique marker genes and spatial localization:
- **SOX6_AGTR1:** Marked by SOX6 and AGTR1, highly localized to the ventral tier of the SNpc. This subtype is the most vulnerable to PD-associated degeneration, showing the greatest proportional loss in PD/LBD. It is also highly enriched for PD genetic risk loci and upregulates TP53 and NR2F2 targets, implicating cell-intrinsic stress and death pathways. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
- **CALB1_GEM and CALB1_TRHR:** Marked by CALB1 with GEM or TRHR, respectively, and localized to the dorsal tier. These subtypes are relatively increased in PD/LBD, suggesting relative resistance. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
- Other subtypes (e.g., SOX6_DDT, SOX6_PART1, CALB1_CALCR, CALB1_RBP4, CALB1_PPP1R17, CALB1_CRYM_CCDC68, SOX6_GFRA2) are defined by additional marker genes but do not show significant disease-associated changes.

**Spatial and Morphological Validation:**  
Slide-seq spatial transcriptomics in macaque and smFISH in human tissue confirmed the ventral localization of SOX6_AGTR1 and dorsal localization of CALB1_GEM/TRHR. smFISH validated the selective depletion of SOX6_AGTR1 and relative sparing/increase of CALB1_GEM/TRHR in PD.

**Pathway and Regulatory Analysis:**  
SOX6_AGTR1 cells upregulate TP53 and NR2F2 target genes, implicating canonical cell stress and death pathways. Gene ontology analysis highlights regulation of neuron death and Wnt signaling in vulnerable subtypes. SCENIC analysis identified distinct regulons for each DA subtype, with SOX6_AGTR1 showing specific upregulation of stress/death-related transcription factors.

**Genetic and Host Modulators:**  
PD genetic risk loci are highly enriched in DA neurons, especially SOX6_AGTR1, but not in other cell types. No specific modulators (age, sex, genotype) are reported for non-DA excitatory neurons.

**Non-DA Excitatory Neurons:**  
The study does not provide a detailed molecular taxonomy or disease association analysis for non-DA excitatory neurons in the SNpc. These neurons are included in the "non-DA neuron" class, but no further subtyping, marker gene analysis, or disease association is reported. The main disease-relevant findings are restricted to DA neuron subtypes.

**Contradictions/Departures:**  
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
The authors do not report explicit contradictions regarding excitatory neuron findings compared to prior literature.

---

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**  
This study provides a high-resolution molecular taxonomy of DA neuron subtypes in the human SNpc, revealing that selective vulnerability in PD is confined to a specific DA (excitatory) neuron subtype (SOX6_AGTR1), with strong genetic and transcriptional evidence for cell-intrinsic degeneration pathways. For the broader class of excitatory neurons, the lack of significant disease-associated changes suggests that PD pathogenesis is highly cell-type-specific within the SNpc. Open questions include whether similar selective vulnerability exists among excitatory neurons in other brain regions, and whether non-DA excitatory neurons might be affected at later disease stages or in other neurodegenerative contexts. The DA neuron subtype classification aligns with known developmental axes (SOX6–CALB1) and is consistent with prior rodent and primate studies, but the explicit focus on DA neurons means that the taxonomy and disease associations of non-DA excitatory neurons remain to be fully elucidated. No conflicts with prior models are reported for excitatory neurons.

# summary for Kousi 2022 (excitatory neurons)

**Quick Reference (≈100 words)**  
This study provides the first single-cell map of somatic mosaicism in Alzheimer’s dementia (AlzD), revealing a significantly increased somatic mutational burden in excitatory neurons of AlzD individuals compared to controls. Excitatory neurons (marked by CAMK2A, NRGN, SLC17A7) show a 30% higher mutational load in AlzD, with mutations enriched in genes involved in protein degradation (USP34, MYCBP2), DNA damage (SETX), axon growth (NEFM), and synaptic function (CYFIP2, PCDH9). The mutational burden correlates with altered gene expression and proximity to a senescent-like cell state, and is associated with clinical diagnosis and Braak stage, but not sex.

- Disease focus: Alzheimer’s dementia (AlzD)
</metadata>

<methods>
The study used full-length single-nucleus RNA sequencing (SMART-Seq2) on 4,014 nuclei from the prefrontal cortex of 36 individuals (19 AlzD, 17 controls), with matched whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to jointly infer somatic mutations and cell-type identity. Cell types were annotated using canonical marker genes, and mutational burden was quantified per cell and per gene, with pathway enrichment analyses performed for cell-type-specific mutational patterns.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Identification**  
Excitatory neurons comprised 21.6% of the analyzed nuclei and were identified by high expression of CAMK2A, NRGN, and SLC17A7. No major changes in the proportion of excitatory neurons between AlzD and controls were reported, but a distinct "senescent" cell cluster (AXL, SENP7) was enriched in AlzD.

**Somatic Mutational Burden in Excitatory Neurons**  
AlzD individuals exhibited a 30% increase in somatic mutational burden in excitatory neurons compared to controls (p=0.029), a finding that was robust across clinical diagnosis and Braak stage. This burden was observed for all mutation types (synonymous, missense, loss-of-function), with the greatest enrichment for highly deleterious variants (CADD>30, +32%, p=0.001). <keyFinding priority='1'>Excitatory neurons are a primary site of AlzD-associated somatic mosaicism, with a substantial increase in mutational load in disease.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Excitatory Neuron Subtypes and Cell States**  
Unbiased sub-clustering of excitatory neurons revealed at least two major subtypes (Exc0, Exc1). Exc0, which is transcriptionally closer to the senescent cluster, showed significantly higher mutational burden (P=3.6e-9) and was more enriched in AlzD (P=2.98e-7). <keyFinding priority='2'>A gradient of mutational burden exists within excitatory neuron subtypes, with higher-burden subclusters exhibiting gene expression profiles closer to senescent-like states.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Defining Marker Genes and Functional Signatures**  
Excitatory neurons were defined by CAMK2A, NRGN, SLC17A7. Within AlzD, somatic mutations were enriched in genes with key neuronal functions:
- **USP34, MYCBP2**: protein degradation
- **SETX**: DNA damage response
- **NEFM**: axon growth and transport
- **CCPG1**: ER tubule turnover
- **CYFIP2, PCDH9**: synaptic function  
These genes showed increased mutational burden specifically in excitatory neurons from AlzD individuals, and the affected cells were not limited to high-burden or senescent-like states, but also present in lower-burden subclusters. <keyFinding priority='1'>AlzD-associated somatic mutations in excitatory neurons are concentrated in genes critical for neuronal maintenance and synaptic function.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Pathway Enrichment**  
Pathways with increased mutational burden in excitatory neurons of AlzD included:
- Neuronal energy regulation (glycosylation, sialic acid metabolism)
- Protein turnover and degradation (neddylation)
- DNA damage repair (excision repair)
- Stress response (hypoxia, syndecan signaling)
- Axonal transport and vesicle trafficking  
<keyFinding priority='2'>Somatic mutations in AlzD excitatory neurons converge on pathways implicated in neuronal metabolism, proteostasis, and axonal integrity.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Correlation with Gene Expression and Cell State**  
A strong correlation was observed between single-cell mutational burden and gene expression changes. Excitatory neurons with higher mutational load showed expression profiles closer to the senescent cluster, suggesting a link between somatic mutation accumulation and cellular dysfunction. This gradient was evident both between and within subclusters. <keyFinding priority='2'>Mutational burden in excitatory neurons is associated with a shift toward a senescent-like transcriptional state, potentially reflecting or driving cellular dysfunction in AlzD.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators and Metrics**  
Mutational burden in excitatory neurons correlated with clinical diagnosis and Braak stage, but not with sex. Age showed a weak positive correlation with burden in neurons (r=0.09), but the disease effect was stronger. No evidence for APOE genotype or other genetic risk factors as direct modulators of excitatory neuron mutational burden was reported. <keyFinding priority='3'>Clinical diagnosis and neuropathological stage are stronger modulators of excitatory neuron mutational burden than age or sex.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**  
Spatial transcriptomics or direct morphological validation was not performed, but t-SNE embedding and marker gene expression confirmed the identity and distribution of excitatory neuron subtypes.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**  
The study suggests a continuum from healthy to senescent-like states in excitatory neurons, with mutational burden increasing along this trajectory, especially in AlzD. However, the cross-sectional design precludes definitive temporal ordering. <keyFinding priority='2'>There is a putative trajectory from homeostatic to dysfunctional/senescent-like excitatory neurons, marked by increasing somatic mutation burden in AlzD.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**  
Somatic mutations in excitatory neurons were enriched in known AlzD genes (e.g., APP, PSEN1/2, BIN1, CLU), supporting the relevance of these findings to established genetic risk pathways.

</findings>

<clinical>
The findings implicate excitatory neurons as a key cellular substrate for somatic mosaicism in Alzheimer’s dementia. The enrichment of damaging mutations in genes involved in neuronal maintenance, synaptic function, and stress response suggests that somatic mutation accumulation may contribute to neuronal dysfunction and disease progression. The correlation between mutational burden and a shift toward a senescent-like state further supports a potential mechanistic link, although causality cannot be established from cross-sectional data. These results highlight the potential for somatic mosaicism to serve as a biomarker or therapeutic target in AlzD, particularly in excitatory neurons.
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**  
This study establishes a foundational framework for analyzing cell-type-specific somatic mosaicism in neurodegenerative disease, with excitatory neurons emerging as a major site of AlzD-associated mutational burden. Open questions include the causal directionality between mutation accumulation and neuronal dysfunction, the precise temporal dynamics of excitatory neuron substate transitions, and the functional consequences of specific mutations in key genes (e.g., USP34, NEFM, CYFIP2). The observed subclusters and marker genes largely align with known excitatory neuron classifications, but the link to senescent-like states is novel. Future work should employ longitudinal and spatially-resolved approaches, as well as joint DNA/RNA profiling, to clarify the interplay between somatic mutations, gene expression, and neurodegeneration. The authors note no explicit contradictions with prior models, but highlight that previous studies focused almost exclusively on neurons, whereas their data reveal parallel burdens in glia. The findings underscore the need to consider somatic mosaicism as a contributor to cellular heterogeneity and disease mechanisms in Alzheimer’s dementia.

# summary for Kumar 2022 (excitatory neurons)

1) **Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

In Kumar et al. (2022, Nature Neuroscience), single-cell CITE-seq of pediatric drug-refractory epilepsy (DRE) brain tissue revealed that excitatory neurons, while present among non-immune (CD45–) clusters, did not show major disease-associated transcriptional shifts or distinct subtypes in the epileptic lesions. The study’s primary findings centered on glial and immune cell activation, with excitatory neurons largely serving as a reference for non-immune cell identity. No significant changes in excitatory neuron proportions, marker gene expression, or disease-associated states were reported, and their role in the pro-inflammatory microenvironment appeared secondary to glial and immune mechanisms. <keyFinding priority='3'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

</metadata>

<methods>
The study utilized single-cell CITE-seq (simultaneous transcriptome and surface protein profiling) on surgically resected brain tissue from six pediatric DRE patients (11 samples, various cortical regions). Immune and non-immune cells were isolated, and clustering was performed using Seurat, with cell identities validated by both gene and surface marker expression. Multispectral immunohistochemistry (IHC) and comparison to control/ASD datasets were used for validation.
</methods>

<findings>
Excitatory neurons were identified among the non-immune (CD45–) clusters, specifically within the neurovascular unit (NVU) and other parenchymal cell populations. However, the study’s clustering and subsequent analyses did not focus on excitatory neuron subtypes or disease-associated transcriptional states within this cell type. Instead, the main findings centered on microglia, infiltrating immune cells, and their pro-inflammatory activation in DRE.

**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Excitatory neurons (as part of the CD45– population) were present in all samples, but the study did not report significant quantitative changes in their abundance between DRE and control tissue. The primary quantitative shifts were observed in immune and glial populations.

**Differential Gene Expression & Pathway Enrichment:**  
No major disease-associated differential gene expression or pathway enrichment was reported for excitatory neurons. The study’s transcriptomic focus was on microglia (e.g., upregulation of IL1B, TNF, HLA-DRA, complement genes) and infiltrating T cells, with excitatory neurons serving as a reference for non-immune cell identity.

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
The authors did not report distinct excitatory neuron subtypes or altered states in DRE tissue. Clusters expressing neuronal markers (e.g., MAP2, as validated by IHC) were used to demarcate non-immune parenchymal cells, but no further subdivision or disease association was described for excitatory neurons. <keyFinding priority='3'>Excitatory neurons were not a focus of subtype or state analysis, and no disease-associated excitatory neuron subpopulations were identified.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Morphological/Spatial Findings:**  
Multispectral IHC included MAP2 staining to identify neurons, confirming their presence in both DRE and control tissue. However, the spatial or morphological analysis did not reveal disease-specific changes in excitatory neuron distribution or structure.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
No pseudotime or trajectory analysis was performed for excitatory neurons, and the study did not address potential transitions or state changes in this cell type during epileptogenesis.

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
No host, genetic, or pathological factors were reported to modulate excitatory neuron states or proportions in this dataset.

**Gene Regulatory Networks, Cell-Cell Communication, Spatial Analysis:**  
The ligand-receptor interactome analysis focused on interactions between immune cells, microglia, and the NVU (including pericytes, endothelial cells, and smooth muscle cells), but did not highlight excitatory neuron-specific signaling or cross-talk. <keyFinding priority='3'>Excitatory neurons were not implicated as major sources or targets of pro-inflammatory signaling in the DRE microenvironment.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
No eQTL or genetic risk variant analysis was performed for excitatory neuron subtypes.

**Summary of Negative Findings:**  
Overall, the study provides little evidence for disease-associated heterogeneity, altered states, or functional shifts in excitatory neurons in pediatric DRE lesions. Their main role in the analysis was as a reference for non-immune cell identity, with no significant findings reported for this cell type. <keyFinding priority='3'>The lack of excitatory neuron-specific findings is consistent across all major result categories.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

The study does not implicate excitatory neurons as primary drivers or modulators of the pro-inflammatory microenvironment in DRE.

3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

The absence of major findings for excitatory neurons in this single-cell study of pediatric DRE suggests that, at least in this context, disease-associated transcriptional and functional heterogeneity is dominated by glial and immune cell populations. This does not preclude a role for excitatory neurons in epileptogenesis, but indicates that their contribution may not be reflected in large-scale transcriptional shifts or distinct subtypes detectable by CITE-seq in resected lesions. Future studies could employ higher-resolution neuronal subclustering, spatial transcriptomics, or electrophysiological integration to explore subtle or circuit-level changes in excitatory neurons. The findings align with prior work emphasizing neuroinflammation and immune infiltration as key features of refractory epilepsy, rather than primary neuronal pathology. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> The lack of excitatory neuron-specific disease states in this dataset is consistent with the study’s focus and with the broader literature on neuroinflammatory mechanisms in DRE.

# summary for Lau 2020 (excitatory neurons)

1) **Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

Single-nucleus RNA-seq of human prefrontal cortex in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) revealed that excitatory neurons (CAMK2A+, CBLN2+, LDB2+) show substantial transcriptomic dysregulation, with 347 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) primarily linked to impaired synaptic signaling. No major changes in excitatory neuron proportions or clear disease-associated subtypes were detected, but downregulation of synaptic genes (e.g., SNAP25, NRXN1/3) was prominent. These alterations were consistent across sexes and validated against independent datasets. The study highlights that excitatory neuron dysfunction in AD is tightly associated with synaptic loss, with no evidence for strong modulation by genetic or demographic factors within this cohort.

Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
</metadata>

<methods>
This study performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on 169,496 nuclei isolated from prefrontal cortex tissue (Brodmann areas 6, 8, 9) of 12 AD patients and 9 age-matched normal controls (NC). The workflow included nuclear isolation, droplet-based encapsulation, library construction, and sequencing (NovaSeq 6000). Cell types were identified using canonical and novel marker genes, and subclustering was performed for major cell types. Validation included comparison with bulk microarray and independent snRNA-seq datasets.
</methods>

<findings>
Excitatory neurons, identified by CAMK2A, CBLN2, and LDB2 expression, comprised the largest cell population (45.2% of nuclei) in both AD and NC samples. UMAP clustering and quantitative analysis showed no significant difference in the proportion of excitatory neurons between AD and controls, indicating that gross excitatory neuron loss is not a primary feature in the sampled prefrontal cortex at the studied disease stages. <keyFinding priority='2'>The absence of major changes in excitatory neuron abundance suggests that functional, rather than numerical, alterations predominate in AD.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Transcriptomic profiling revealed 347 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in excitatory neurons between AD and NC. The majority of these DEGs were downregulated in AD (201 down, 146 up; see Fig. 3C). Pathway analysis indicated that these changes were strongly enriched for synaptic signaling, postsynaptic organization, and glutamate secretion. <keyFinding priority='1'>Key downregulated genes included SNAP25, NRXN1, NRXN3, TNIK, HES5, and SLC1A2, all of which are critical for synaptic function and neurotransmitter cycling.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> Notably, NRXN1 and NRXN3, which regulate excitatory synaptogenesis, were specifically reduced in AD, suggesting impaired synaptic connectivity.

Upregulated genes in excitatory neurons were less prominent and not strongly associated with a single functional pathway, but included some stress response and chaperone-related genes (e.g., HSPA1A). <keyFinding priority='2'>The overall pattern points to a loss of synaptic integrity and plasticity in excitatory neurons in AD.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Subclustering analysis was performed for astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, microglia, and endothelial cells, but not for excitatory neurons, as the authors state that only subtle DEG changes were observed in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, precluding robust identification of disease-associated subtypes or states within these populations. <keyFinding priority='3'>Thus, no distinct AD-associated excitatory neuron subpopulations were reported in this study.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

The transcriptomic changes in excitatory neurons were validated by comparison with both bulk microarray data (Narayanan et al., 2014; Webster et al., 2009) and an independent snRNA-seq dataset (Mathys et al., 2019). Of the DEGs identified in this study, 97 overlapped with Mathys et al., and >90% of these showed concordant direction of change. Pathway analysis of overlapping DEGs confirmed enrichment for synaptic signaling. <keyFinding priority='2'>This cross-study validation supports the robustness of the observed excitatory neuron transcriptomic alterations in AD.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

No significant modulation of excitatory neuron transcriptomic changes by sex was observed, as DEG patterns were concordant in both males and females, though the magnitude of changes varied slightly. The study did not report analysis of APOE genotype or other genetic risk factors specifically within excitatory neurons. <keyFinding priority='3'>No evidence for strong genetic or demographic modulation of excitatory neuron states was presented.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Morphological or spatial validation was not performed for excitatory neuron subtypes, as the main findings were based on transcriptomic data. No pseudotime or trajectory analysis was reported for excitatory neurons, and the study did not identify temporal or disease-stage-specific transitions within this cell type.

In summary, the principal finding for excitatory neurons is a robust, cell type-specific downregulation of synaptic and neurotransmission-related genes in AD, without evidence for major changes in cell abundance or emergence of distinct disease-associated subpopulations. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that synaptic dysfunction, rather than neuronal loss, is a key feature of AD pathogenesis in the prefrontal cortex. <keyFinding priority='1'>The loss of synaptic gene expression in excitatory neurons may underlie the cognitive deficits observed in AD.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
The study implicates excitatory neuron dysfunction—specifically, impaired synaptic signaling and neurotransmitter cycling—as a central mechanism in AD pathogenesis. The downregulation of genes such as SNAP25 and NRXN1/3 suggests that excitatory neurons may lose their ability to maintain synaptic connectivity and plasticity, potentially contributing to cognitive decline. However, as these findings are based on cross-sectional transcriptomic data, causality cannot be firmly established. The lack of major changes in excitatory neuron abundance or emergence of disease-associated subtypes suggests that therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring synaptic function, rather than preventing cell loss, may be most effective for this cell type. <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>
</clinical>

3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study provides strong evidence that excitatory neuron dysfunction in AD is primarily characterized by downregulation of synaptic and neurotransmission-related genes, rather than by loss of cell number or emergence of distinct disease-associated subtypes. The findings align with prior models emphasizing synaptic failure as a key driver of cognitive impairment in AD. However, the absence of clear excitatory neuron subpopulations or trajectory shifts in this dataset raises questions about whether more subtle or region-specific disease-associated states might exist, or whether such states are masked by technical or sampling limitations. Future work should employ higher-resolution or spatially resolved transcriptomics, integrate genetic risk stratification (e.g., APOE genotype), and examine earlier or later disease stages to determine if excitatory neuron subtypes with distinct vulnerability or resilience can be identified. The robust cross-validation with independent datasets strengthens confidence in these results, but also highlights the need for functional studies to determine whether restoring synaptic gene expression in excitatory neurons can ameliorate AD phenotypes. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

# summary for Lee 2023 (excitatory neurons)

**Quick Reference (Excitatory Neurons / DopaNs in Substantia Nigra, Parkinson’s Disease):**

This multiomic single-nucleus study of human substantia nigra in Parkinson’s disease (PD) identifies a selective loss and molecular dysregulation of AGTR1+ dopaminergic neurons (DopaNs), a key excitatory neuronal subtype. DopaNs show the strongest enrichment for downregulated genes and cis-regulatory elements (cREs) linked to mitochondrial dysfunction and PD risk loci, with genetic and epigenetic disruptions converging on this cell type. AGTR1+ DopaNs are especially vulnerable, and their regulatory landscape is shaped by both PD GWAS variants and altered chromatin accessibility.

Disease focus: Parkinson’s disease (PD)
</metadata>

<methods>
This study integrates single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) and ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) from postmortem human substantia nigra (SN) of late-stage PD and control cases, with additional bulk RNA-seq, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, and in situ Hi-C for 3D chromatin mapping. Cell type annotation and subclustering were performed using canonical markers, and multiomic integration enabled mapping of cis-regulatory elements (cREs) and their target genes.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Identification**  
Excitatory neurons in the SN are represented by dopaminergic neurons (DopaNs), which were further subclustered based on AGTR1 expression. The AGTR1+ DopaN subpopulation is significantly reduced in PD compared to controls (P = 0.035), while AGTR1− DopaNs are less affected (P = 0.104), indicating selective vulnerability. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> This aligns with recent reports of AGTR1+ DopaN susceptibility in PD.</keyFinding>

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathways**  
DopaNs exhibit the largest number of downregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in PD, including known PD risk genes (UCHL1, PARK7, CHCHD2, VPS13C, GAK). Downregulated genes are enriched for mitochondrial function, ATP synthesis, and neurogenesis regulation, while upregulated genes relate to autophagy and protein folding. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> This supports a central role for mitochondrial dysfunction and proteostasis in DopaN pathology.</keyFinding>

**Cis-Regulatory Element (cRE) Dysregulation**  
DopaNs show a strong colocalization of downregulated DEGs with downregulated cREs, indicating that loss of regulatory activity is tightly linked to transcriptional suppression in this cell type. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> Pathway analysis of these cREs reinforces mitochondrial and synaptic dysfunction as key features.

**Subtype-Specific Regulatory Features**  
The AGTR1+ DopaN subtype is particularly affected, with a pronounced reduction in cell proportion and regulatory activity. The study does not report further molecular subtypes within DopaNs beyond AGTR1 status, but highlights this as a critical axis of vulnerability.

**Genetic and Epigenetic Integration**  
DopaN cREs are enriched for PD GWAS variants, especially in East Asian cohorts, and show significant overlap with eQTLs and dysregulated chromatin regions. Hi-C and ABC modeling identify 165 DopaN-specific target genes of dysregulated cREs and PD risk variants, many of which are implicated in mitochondrial function, synaptic transmission, and endocytosis. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> Experimental CRISPR-Cas9 disruption of a DopaN cRE harboring PD GWAS SNPs (TOMM7, KLHL7, NUPL2) in SH-SY5Y cells reduces expression of these genes, validating regulatory predictions.

**Transcription Factor (TF) Disruption**  
Motif analysis reveals that PD GWAS SNPs in DopaN cREs preferentially disrupt binding of TFs such as NRF1, TFDP1, and TCF4, which are linked to mitochondrial and synaptic gene regulation. Target genes of cREs with disrupted TF motifs are consistently downregulated in PD DopaNs. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> This suggests a mechanism by which genetic risk converges on DopaN regulatory networks.

**Disease Trajectories and Coexpression Modules**  
Hierarchical clustering of 656 putative PD genes (from cRE and GWAS integration) reveals modular expression patterns. DopaN-associated modules (C1, C2) are enriched for unfolded protein response, oxidative stress, endocytosis, and synaptic function, with strong cell type specificity. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> These modules are dominated by downregulated cRE targets, reinforcing the theme of regulatory loss.

**Host/Genetic Modulators**  
No explicit mention of age, sex, or APOE genotype as modulators of DopaN subtypes is made, but the study notes that PD GWAS enrichment in DopaNs is cohort-specific (East Asian vs. European), suggesting possible ancestry effects.

**Spatial/Morphological Validation**  
No direct spatial transcriptomics or immunohistochemical validation of DopaN subtypes is reported, but the AGTR1+ DopaN loss is supported by snRNA-seq and prior literature.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> The authors do not report explicit contradictions with prior models for DopaNs, but note that their findings extend previous work by integrating regulatory and genetic data at single-cell resolution.
</findings>

<clinical>
DopaNs, especially the AGTR1+ subtype, are the principal excitatory neuron population affected in PD substantia nigra. Their selective loss and transcriptional repression—driven by both genetic risk variants and epigenomic dysregulation—underscore their central role in PD pathogenesis. The convergence of mitochondrial, synaptic, and proteostatic dysfunction in DopaNs highlights these pathways as potential therapeutic targets. The identification of regulatory elements and TFs disrupted by PD risk variants in DopaNs suggests new avenues for biomarker and intervention development, though causal relationships remain to be fully established.
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications**

This study provides a high-resolution, multiomic map of excitatory neuron (DopaN) vulnerability in PD, with a particular focus on the AGTR1+ subpopulation. The integration of chromatin, transcriptomic, and genetic data robustly links PD risk variants to regulatory dysfunction in DopaNs, supporting and extending prior models of mitochondrial and synaptic impairment. The findings align with recent single-cell studies identifying AGTR1+ DopaNs as selectively vulnerable, but add new mechanistic insight by mapping the regulatory and genetic architecture underlying this susceptibility.

Open questions include the temporal sequence of regulatory and transcriptional changes in DopaNs, the functional consequences of specific cRE and TF disruptions, and the potential for targeting these pathways therapeutically. The study’s approach could be extended to earlier disease stages or to spatially resolved datasets to further dissect DopaN heterogeneity and progression. No explicit contradictions with prior DopaN classification schemes are noted; rather, the work builds on and refines existing models by integrating multiomic data.

# summary for Lee 2024 (excitatory neurons)

1) **Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This large-scale single-nucleus RNA-seq atlas of the human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) from 1,494 donors across eight neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases identifies ten major subclasses of excitatory neurons (ENs), each with distinct laminar and projection identities. Disease-associated vulnerability is most pronounced in superficial (L2/3 IT) and deep-layer (L5/6) ENs, with L2/3 IT neurons showing selective loss in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and deep-layer ENs (notably L6) linked to neuropsychiatric symptoms in AD. Transcriptomic changes in ENs are dominated by downregulation of synaptic and metabolic pathways, with disease progression and cognitive decline modulating these effects. Genetic risk and pathology (e.g., APOE, polygenic risk scores) further stratify EN vulnerability.

</metadata>

<methods>
The study generated a single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) atlas from the DLPFC of 1,494 donors, spanning neurotypical controls and eight major brain disorders. Over 6.3 million nuclei were profiled, with rigorous batch correction, iterative clustering, and spatial transcriptomic validation (Xenium in situ) confirming cell type and laminar identities. The taxonomy identified 8 major cell classes, 27 subclasses, and 65 subtypes, with excitatory neurons (ENs) further divided by laminar and projection characteristics.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Structure**  
Excitatory neurons (ENs) constitute ~23% of all nuclei, subdivided into 10 subclasses based on laminar position (L2–L6) and projection type (IT: intratelencephalic, ET: extratelencephalic, NP: near-projecting, CT: corticothalamic, L6B). Spatial transcriptomics confirmed these subclasses are spatially restricted to their expected cortical layers (<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>). The EN subclasses are:
- EN_L2_3_IT_1, EN_L2_3_IT_2: Superficial layer 2/3 IT neurons
- EN_L3_5_IT_1, EN_L3_5_IT_2, EN_L3_5_IT_3: Intermediate IT neurons
- EN_L5_ET: Layer 5 ET neurons
- EN_L6_CT: Layer 6 corticothalamic neurons
- EN_L6B: Layer 6B neurons
- EN_L5_6_NP: Deep-layer near-projecting neurons
- EN_L6_IT: Layer 6 IT neurons

Each subclass is defined by canonical marker genes (e.g., CUX2 for L2/3, FEZF2 for L5, TLE4 for L6, FOXP2 for CT), with additional markers detailed in Supplementary Table 2 and Figure 2d.

**Disease-Associated Changes in Excitatory Neurons**  
- **Alzheimer’s Disease (AD):**  
  - There is a selective and significant loss of EN_L2_3_IT neurons in AD, not observed in normal aging, indicating disease-specific vulnerability of superficial IT neurons (<keyFinding priority='1'>EN_L2_3_IT neurons are specifically depleted in AD, not aging</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).  
  - Deep-layer ENs (notably L6 IT and L6 CT) show increased proportions in AD patients with neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS), especially those with weight loss and psychomotor agitation, suggesting a link between deep-layer ENs and behavioral phenotypes in AD (<keyFinding priority='2'>Deep-layer ENs (L6) are associated with NPS in AD</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).
  - Across AD progression (measured by CERAD, Braak, and dementia status), ENs exhibit a general downregulation of genes involved in synaptic assembly, neurotransmitter secretion, and metabolic pathways (e.g., cytoplasmic translation, mitochondrial function). These changes are more pronounced in late-stage disease and are associated with cognitive decline (<keyFinding priority='1'>ENs show progressive downregulation of synaptic and metabolic genes with AD pathology and dementia</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).
  - Pseudotime/trajectory analysis reveals that EN gene expression changes are relatively linear compared to more nonlinear immune cell responses, with late-stage upregulation of synaptic genes possibly reflecting compensatory mechanisms (<keyFinding priority='2'>Late-stage upregulation of synaptic genes in ENs may reflect compensatory responses</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

- **Other Neurodegenerative and Neuropsychiatric Diseases:**  
  - In cross-disorder analyses, neuropsychiatric diseases (SCZ, BD) are associated with increased proportions of deep-layer ENs (L5/6), while neurodegenerative diseases (AD, DLBD, Vas, PD) show greater loss of superficial ENs and increased non-neuronal cell types.
  - Shared transcriptomic signatures across AD, DLBD, Vas, and PD are dominated by alterations in neuronal development and synaptic signaling pathways, with ENs and specific interneuron subtypes (IN_LAMP5_RELN, IN_ADARB2, IN_PVALB) implicated (<keyFinding priority='2'>ENs are central to shared synaptic dysfunction across multiple neurodegenerative diseases</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**  
- ENs in AD show downregulation of synaptic vesicle priming, neurotransmitter secretion, and metabolic pathways (e.g., cytoplasmic translation, mitochondrial function, ATP synthesis), with upregulation of stress-response and chaperone-mediated protein folding genes in late stages.
- Pathway enrichment analyses (Figures 7c, Supplementary Figs. 9–11, 13) highlight early and late damaging/protective gene modules, with synaptic and metabolic pathways being most affected in ENs.
- Genes with high inter-individual variability in ENs are less constrained and often relate to basal cellular functions, suggesting regulatory flexibility in these neurons.

**Modulators and Metrics**  
- Genetic risk (polygenic risk scores for AD) and APOE genotype stratify EN vulnerability, with mediation analysis indicating that genetic risk contributes to plaque and tau pathology, which in turn drive EN loss and cognitive decline.
- Age, sex, and ancestry are accounted for as covariates, but disease-specific EN changes remain significant after adjustment.

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**  
- Spatial transcriptomics (Xenium in situ) confirms the laminar localization of EN subclasses and validates marker gene expression patterns.
- The EN taxonomy is consistent across three independent brain banks and diverse ancestries.

**Aging and Disease Trajectories**  
- EN compositional and transcriptomic changes in AD are largely discordant with those seen in normal aging, underscoring disease-specific mechanisms.
- Trajectory modeling shows that EN gene expression changes are more linear than those in immune or glial cells, but late-stage compensatory upregulation of synaptic genes is observed.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> for all major findings, as the authors do not explicitly discuss conflicts with prior EN subtype models, but note general concordance with previous DLPFC taxonomies.

</findings>

<clinical>
Excitatory neurons, particularly superficial (L2/3 IT) and deep-layer (L5/6) subtypes, are central to the pathogenesis of AD and other neurodegenerative diseases. The selective vulnerability of EN_L2_3_IT neurons to AD pathology, and the association of deep-layer ENs with neuropsychiatric symptoms, suggest that distinct EN subtypes mediate different aspects of cognitive and behavioral decline. The progressive downregulation of synaptic and metabolic pathways in ENs may underlie synaptic dysfunction and cognitive impairment, while late-stage compensatory responses could represent targets for intervention. Genetic risk factors modulate EN vulnerability, supporting the potential for personalized therapeutic strategies targeting specific EN subtypes or their molecular pathways.

3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study establishes a comprehensive, spatially validated taxonomy of excitatory neuron subtypes in the human DLPFC and demonstrates their differential vulnerability across neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric diseases. The identification of disease- and symptom-specific EN subtype changes—particularly the selective loss of L2/3 IT neurons in AD and the involvement of deep-layer ENs in neuropsychiatric symptoms—provides a refined framework for understanding cortical circuit dysfunction in dementia and psychiatric disorders. The robust alignment of EN subtypes with prior taxonomies (e.g., Ma et al. 2022, BICCN 2021) and the lack of explicit contradictions with previous models (<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>) reinforce the reliability of these findings.

Open questions include the mechanistic basis of selective EN vulnerability, the functional consequences of late-stage compensatory gene expression, and the potential for targeting specific EN subtypes or pathways for therapeutic intervention. Future studies should integrate longitudinal and functional data to clarify causal relationships and explore the interplay between ENs and other cell types (e.g., interneurons, glia, vasculature) in disease progression. The atlas serves as a foundational resource for dissecting cell-type-specific mechanisms and developing precision therapies in neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders.

Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on postmortem human brain tissue from the caudal entorhinal cortex (EC) and superior frontal gyrus (SFG), regions affected early and late in AD, respectively. Samples were from 10 male individuals (APOE ε3/ε3) spanning Braak stages 0, 2, and 6. Cross-sample alignment and clustering were used to define cell types and subpopulations independently of disease stage.

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**

This study identifies a selectively vulnerable subpopulation of excitatory neurons in the human entorhinal cortex (EC) marked by RORB expression, which undergoes early and substantial depletion during Alzheimer’s disease progression. RORB+ excitatory neurons (EC:Exc.s2 and EC:Exc.s4) are highly susceptible to tau pathology and are depleted by Braak stage 2, as validated by immunofluorescence. These subtypes are defined by unique marker genes (RORB, CTC-340A15.2, CTC-535M15.2) and are not driven by APOE genotype or sex, as the cohort was restricted to APOE ε3/ε3 males.

**Detailed Summary (≈1000 words):**

<findings>
The study systematically profiled excitatory neurons in the EC and SFG across AD progression, focusing on cell-type heterogeneity, molecular signatures, and disease associations.

**Cell Type Proportions and Disease Progression:**  
In the EC, the relative abundance of excitatory neurons showed a downward trend with increasing Braak stage, with a statistically significant reduction at Braak stage 6 (Punadjusted = 0.02). In the SFG, a significant reduction was observed only at Braak stage 6 (Punadjusted = 0.05), consistent with the known early vulnerability of the EC and late involvement of the SFG in AD. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Excitatory Neuron Subtype Identification and Characterization:**  
Nine excitatory neuron subpopulations were identified in the EC (EC:Exc.s0–s8), each with distinct marker gene profiles and correspondence to mouse EC layers. Three subpopulations—EC:Exc.s1, EC:Exc.s2, and EC:Exc.s4—expressed genes associated with mouse EC layer II, the region known for early tau pathology and neuronal loss in AD.

- **EC:Exc.s2 and EC:Exc.s4:**  
  - **Defining markers:** RORB, CTC-340A15.2, CTC-535M15.2 (high expression).
  - **Functional signature:** Enriched for axon-localized proteins and voltage-gated potassium channels; depleted for synapse- and dendrite-localized proteins and G-protein-mediated signaling.
  - **Disease association:** Both subtypes showed a dramatic ~50% reduction in relative abundance by Braak stage 2, with no further decrease at stage 6, indicating early and selective depletion.  
  - **Validation:** Immunofluorescence confirmed a substantial reduction of RORB+ excitatory neurons in EC superficial layers in Braak stages 2–4 and 5–6 compared to 0–1. RORB+ neurons were preferentially affected by phospho-tau (CP13) inclusions.  
  - **Morphology:** RORB+ neurons included both large multipolar (stellate) and pyramidal morphologies, indicating that molecular identity refines vulnerability beyond classical morphological definitions.  
  <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

- **EC:Exc.s1:**  
  - **Defining marker:** CDH9 (also expressed in other subtypes).
  - **Disease association:** Also showed ~50–60% reduction in Braak stage 2, but lacked unique markers for further focus.

Other EC excitatory neuron subpopulations (e.g., EC:Exc.s6, EC:Exc.s8) expressing layer II genes did not show significant vulnerability, and subpopulations expressing layer III or V/VI markers were not depleted; EC:Exc.s5 (layer V/VI) even increased in relative abundance at Braak stage 2, likely reflecting relative sparing as more vulnerable subtypes are lost. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment:**  
Genes upregulated in EC:Exc.s2 and EC:Exc.s4 included those involved in axonal function and potassium channels, while downregulated genes were enriched for synaptic and dendritic components. Across Braak stages, EC:Exc.s2 showed the largest number of downregulated synapse-related genes at stage 6, mirroring findings in familial AD and laser-capture microdissection studies. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Comparison to Neocortical (SFG) Excitatory Neurons:**  
In the SFG, 11 excitatory neuron subpopulations were identified, with SFG:Exc.s2 and SFG:Exc.s4 expressing the same vulnerability markers (RORB, CTC-340A15.2, CTC-535M15.2) as EC:Exc.s2 and EC:Exc.s4. These SFG subtypes trended toward decreased abundance only at Braak stage 6, consistent with late SFG involvement. Transcriptomic similarity between EC and SFG vulnerable subtypes was confirmed by Pearson correlation and cross-region alignment. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Validation and Cross-Dataset Comparison:**  
Reanalysis of the Mathys et al. (2019) prefrontal cortex dataset using the same alignment approach identified RORB+ excitatory neuron subpopulations (Mathys:Exc.s4, s5, s1), with Mathys:Exc.s4 showing significant depletion in male AD cases and high transcriptomic similarity to EC:Exc.s2 and s4. The Marinaro et al. dataset (familial AD) also reported selective vulnerability of RORB+ subpopulations, supporting the generalizability of these findings. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
All snRNA-seq samples were from APOE ε3/ε3 males, so effects of sex or APOE genotype were not assessed in this cohort. Immunofluorescence validation included both sexes and APOE genotypes, but the main findings were robust across these variables. <keyFinding priority='3'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Spatial and Morphological Validation:**  
Multiplex immunofluorescence with cytoarchitectonic precision confirmed the selective depletion of RORB+ excitatory neurons in EC superficial layers and their preferential accumulation of phospho-tau inclusions. Morphological analysis showed that RORB+ neurons encompass both multipolar and pyramidal forms, refining the classical view of EC layer II vulnerability. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
The depletion of RORB+ excitatory neurons occurs early (by Braak stage 2), with little further loss at later stages, suggesting that their vulnerability is an early event in AD pathogenesis. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
The study provides strong evidence that RORB+ excitatory neurons in the EC are selectively and early depleted in AD, likely as a consequence of tau pathology. The molecular signature of these neurons (RORB, CTC-340A15.2, CTC-535M15.2) may underlie their vulnerability and could serve as a basis for future mechanistic studies or therapeutic targeting. The findings suggest that interventions aimed at preserving or restoring the function of these neurons, or modulating their unique molecular pathways, could be of therapeutic value. However, causality is inferred from cross-sectional and associative data, and further experimental work is needed to establish mechanistic links.

**Research Implications (≈200 words):**

This study establishes RORB as a robust marker of selectively vulnerable excitatory neuron subpopulations in the human EC, with strong cross-validation in independent datasets and by quantitative neuropathology. The identification of RORB+ neurons as early targets of tau pathology and neuronal loss provides a molecular entry point for dissecting the mechanisms of selective vulnerability in AD. The findings align with, but also refine, previous models based on morphology and laminar location, showing that molecular identity (RORB expression) is a more precise predictor of vulnerability than cell shape alone.

Open questions include the specific molecular pathways downstream of RORB that mediate susceptibility to tau pathology, the role of noncoding transcripts (CTC-340A15.2, CTC-535M15.2), and whether similar mechanisms operate in other brain regions or in individuals with different genetic backgrounds (e.g., APOE ε4 carriers, females). The study’s approach—defining subpopulations independently of disease stage and validating with spatial and morphological data—sets a standard for future work. The authors note that while not all RORB+ neocortical neurons are vulnerable, those most similar to EC RORB+ neurons are consistently depleted in AD, suggesting a conserved vulnerability program. No explicit contradictions with prior models are discussed; rather, the work extends and molecularly refines existing knowledge.

# summary for Lerma-Martin 2024 (excitatory neurons)

1) **Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This study (Lerma-Martin et al., 2024, *Nature Neuroscience*) used single-nucleus and spatial transcriptomics to map cell types in subcortical multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions, including excitatory neurons (EX). Excitatory neurons were detected primarily in gray matter regions adjacent to white matter lesions, with no evidence for disease-specific EX subtypes or major changes in their abundance or gene expression across lesion types. The main spatial and molecular changes in MS lesions were attributed to glial and immune cells, not excitatory neurons. Age, sex, and MS lesion stage did not significantly modulate EX neuron states in this dataset.

- Disease focus: Multiple sclerosis (MS), subcortical white matter lesions
</metadata>

<methods>
The study combined single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) on postmortem subcortical white matter from 12 MS lesions (8 chronic active [MS-CA], 4 chronic inactive [MS-CI]) and 7 controls. snRNA-seq captured 103,794 nuclei, and ST covered 67,851 spots. Cell types were annotated using canonical markers and compared to a reference atlas. Spatial deconvolution and unsupervised niche analysis were performed to map cell types and states to lesion and non-lesion regions.
</methods>

<findings>
Excitatory neurons (EX), annotated as "NEU" in the dataset, were detected in both snRNA-seq and ST, but only as a minor population. Their presence was attributed to the inclusion of adjacent gray matter during tissue sectioning, as the primary focus was subcortical white matter. The main NEU marker gene was SYT1, and these cells were characteristic of gray matter (GM) regions, not the white matter lesions themselves.

**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Quantitative analysis showed that NEU/EX neurons were rare in the sampled regions. There were no significant changes in the proportion of EX neurons between control, MS-CA, and MS-CI samples. The spatial mapping confirmed that NEU/EX neurons localized to GM, with little or no infiltration into lesion rims, cores, or perivascular niches.

**Differential Gene Expression:**  
No major differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were reported for EX neurons between MS and control samples, nor between lesion types. The study did not identify any disease-associated EX neuron subtypes or states. The transcriptomic signatures of NEU/EX cells remained consistent across conditions, with no evidence for up- or downregulation of stress, inflammatory, or neurodegeneration-related genes in this cell type.

**Pathway Enrichment:**  
Pathway analysis did not highlight any significant enrichment or depletion of biological pathways in EX neurons in MS lesions compared to controls. The main pathway changes in MS lesions were observed in glial (astrocyte, oligodendrocyte, myeloid) and vascular cell types.

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
The study did not report any further subclustering or identification of distinct EX neuron subtypes within the NEU population. No homeostatic versus disease-associated EX neuron states were described. The only functional annotation was the association of NEU/EX cells with GM regions, based on SYT1 and other neuronal markers.

**Spatial Analysis:**  
Spatial transcriptomics confirmed that EX neurons were confined to GM and did not participate in the formation of lesion-specific niches (e.g., lesion rim, core, perivascular infiltrates). There was no evidence for migration, loss, or expansion of EX neurons in or around MS lesions.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
The study did not report any pseudotime or trajectory analysis for EX neurons, nor did it describe any temporal or stage-specific shifts in EX neuron states during MS lesion progression.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
No integration with genetic risk variants, eQTLs, or multi-omic data was performed for EX neurons. The study did not identify any host or genetic factors (age, sex, MS risk alleles) that modulated EX neuron abundance or state.

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
No quantitative activation, stress, or degeneration scores were calculated for EX neurons. The study did not report any influence of demographic or clinical variables on EX neuron properties.

**Gene Regulatory Networks & Cell-Cell Communication:**  
No disease-specific gene regulatory networks or ligand-receptor interactions involving EX neurons were identified. The main cell-cell communication events in MS lesions involved glial, myeloid, and vascular cells, not neurons.

<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

In summary, the study provides a comprehensive spatial and molecular map of subcortical MS lesions, but excitatory neurons were only sparsely detected and showed no evidence of disease-associated subtypes, altered abundance, or gene expression changes. The main cellular and molecular pathology in MS lesions was attributed to glial and immune cells, with EX neurons largely unaffected in the sampled regions.
</findings>

<clinical>
The results suggest that excitatory neurons in subcortical white matter and adjacent GM are not major contributors to the cellular pathology of chronic MS lesions, at least at the transcriptomic and spatial resolution provided here. There is no evidence from this study that EX neuron loss, dysfunction, or disease-associated reprogramming is a hallmark of subcortical MS lesion progression. Thus, EX neurons are unlikely to serve as biomarkers or direct therapeutic targets in this context.
</clinical>

---

3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study demonstrates that, in subcortical MS lesions, excitatory neurons are largely spared from the major cellular and molecular changes that characterize lesion progression. The absence of disease-associated EX neuron subtypes, altered abundance, or transcriptomic signatures suggests that the primary drivers of MS pathology in these regions are glial and immune cells, not neurons. This finding aligns with prior work indicating that neuronal loss in MS is more prominent in cortical GM lesions or at later, atrophic stages, rather than in subcortical white matter. The lack of EX neuron involvement in lesion-specific niches or cell-cell communication networks further supports a glia-centric model of subcortical MS pathology. Open questions remain regarding the vulnerability of EX neurons in cortical lesions, their potential role in neurodegeneration at later disease stages, and whether more sensitive or targeted approaches might reveal subtle changes not captured here. The study does not report any contradictions with previous models, but highlights the need for future work focusing on cortical GM and longitudinal sampling to fully assess EX neuron involvement in MS.

# summary for Li 2023 (excitatory neurons)

<quickReference>
In C9orf72-associated ALS and FTD, single-nucleus RNA-seq and epigenomic profiling of human motor and frontal cortices revealed that excitatory neurons—especially upper-layer (L2/3) and deep-layer (L5/6) subtypes—undergo the most extensive transcriptional disruption in C9-ALS. Hundreds of differentially expressed genes were identified, with upper-layer excitatory neurons showing the greatest changes. Key findings include upregulation of genes involved in proteostasis and metabolism, and downregulation of neuronal function genes. C9orf72 expression itself is reduced in excitatory neurons. These effects are consistent across brain regions and are most pronounced in C9-ALS, with less neuronal disruption in C9-FTD, where glial changes predominate. <keyFinding priority='1'>Upper-layer excitatory neuron dysregulation is the most prominent neuronal signature in C9-ALS, with C9orf72 downregulation and strong enrichment for proteostasis and mitochondrial pathways.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) and ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) were performed on postmortem human motor (BA4) and frontal (BA9) cortices from C9-ALS (n=6), C9-FTD (n=5), and control (n=6) donors. Cell type–specific validation included FANS-sorted bulk RNA-seq and H3K27ac ChIP-seq, as well as Western blotting and immunofluorescence for selected proteins.
</methods>
<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Vulnerability:**  
Excitatory neurons, particularly upper-layer (L2/3) and deep-layer (L5/6) subtypes, exhibited the most pronounced transcriptional changes in C9-ALS. There were hundreds of differentially expressed (DE) genes per subtype (FDR < 0.05), with upper-layer neurons showing 2.5–2.7-fold more DE genes than deep-layer neurons in both motor and frontal cortices. Inhibitory neurons were less affected. In C9-FTD, high-quality neuronal nuclei were depleted in the frontal cortex, precluding detailed analysis, but glial cells showed extensive changes.

**Subtype Characterization:**  
The study identified 49 fine-grained neuronal and glial subpopulations, but for statistical power, grouped excitatory neurons into upper-layer (L2/3), deep-layer (L5/6), and intermediate subtypes.  
- **Upper-layer excitatory neurons (L2/3):**  
  - **Defining markers:** CUX2, SV2C, LRRC2, CCBE1, PDGFD (consistent with Allen Brain Atlas nomenclature).  
  - **Signature:** Strong upregulation of genes involved in mitochondrial function (NDUFA12, COX7A2, ATP5PF), proteostasis (HSP70 family: HSPA4, HSPA8, HSPA9; HSP90AA1; CLU), and protein synthesis (EIF1B, RPS29).  
  - **Downregulated genes:** Neuronal function genes (BDNF, SLIT1/3, ROBO2, SEMA4B/4C/5B, potassium channels KCNN3, KCND3, DNMT3A).  
  - **Disease association:** Most extensive DE in C9-ALS, consistent across motor and frontal cortices.  
  - **Functional implication:** Suggests increased metabolic/proteostatic stress and loss of neuronal function.

  - **Disease association:** Also affected in C9-ALS, but to a lesser degree than upper-layer neurons.

  - <keyFinding priority='3'>Intermediate excitatory neurons are affected but not as prominently as upper or deep layers.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathways:**  
- **Upregulated in C9-ALS excitatory neurons:**  
  - Mitochondrial respiratory chain (NDUF, SDH, UQCR, COX, ATP5 families), mitochondrial transport (SLC25A4, TIMMDC1), proteostasis (HSP70/HSP90, DNAJ, BAG, HSPB1, CLU), protein synthesis (ribosomal proteins RPL/S, MRPL/S, EIF1B).
  - <keyFinding priority='1'>Proteostasis and mitochondrial pathways are strongly upregulated in C9-ALS excitatory neurons, especially upper-layer.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **Downregulated in C9-ALS excitatory neurons:**  
  - Neuronal function genes (BDNF, SLIT/ROBO, SEMA/PLXN, RAP1GAP), potassium channels (KCNN3, KCND3), DNA methyltransferase (DNMT3A).
  - <keyFinding priority='2'>Loss of neuronal function gene expression is a hallmark of C9-ALS excitatory neuron pathology.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **C9orf72 expression:**  
  - Highest in neurons; significantly downregulated in C9-ALS excitatory neurons (not in inhibitory neurons).
  - <keyFinding priority='2'>C9orf72 is selectively downregulated in excitatory neurons in C9-ALS.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Pathway Enrichment:**  
- GO analysis: Upregulated genes enriched for mitochondrial function, protein synthesis, proteostasis, nucleocytoplasmic transport, DNA damage response. Downregulated genes enriched for neuronal projections, cell adhesion, synaptic function.

**Validation and Multi-omic Integration:**  
- Bulk RNA-seq of FANS-sorted nuclei confirmed snRNA-seq findings (Spearman r = 0.52 for upper-layer, r = 0.49 for deep-layer excitatory neurons).
- Western blot confirmed upregulation of HSP90, CLU, and downregulation of KCND3 protein in C9-ALS motor cortex.
- Epigenomic profiling (snATAC-seq, H3K27ac ChIP-seq) showed concordant changes in chromatin accessibility and histone acetylation at DE gene loci in glia, but less so in neurons, possibly due to neuronal subtype heterogeneity.

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
- No explicit genotype (e.g., APOE) or demographic modifiers reported for excitatory neuron subtypes in this study.
- Quantitative: Upper-layer excitatory neurons had 2.5–2.7x more DE genes than deep-layer neurons.

**Spatial/Morphological Data:**  
- No direct spatial transcriptomics or morphological validation for excitatory neuron subtypes; findings are based on snRNA-seq clustering and marker gene expression.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
- No explicit pseudotime or trajectory analysis, but cross-sectional data indicate that upper-layer excitatory neuron dysregulation is a robust feature of end-stage C9-ALS.

**Contradictions:**  
- The authors note little overlap between C9-ALS and Alzheimer’s disease DE genes in excitatory neurons, suggesting disease specificity. Some previously reported mitochondrial protein loss in ALS was not observed at the transcript level here, possibly reflecting compensatory upregulation in surviving neurons. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>
<clinical>
Excitatory neuron dysfunction, especially in upper-layer (L2/3) and deep-layer (L5/6) subtypes, is a central feature of C9-ALS cortical pathology. The upregulation of proteostasis and mitochondrial genes may reflect a compensatory response to proteotoxic and metabolic stress, while downregulation of neuronal function genes likely contributes to neurodegeneration and loss of cortical connectivity. The selective vulnerability of upper-layer excitatory neurons, which are expanded in humans and connect distant cortical regions, may underlie both motor and cognitive symptoms in C9-ALS. The findings suggest that targeting proteostasis and mitochondrial pathways in excitatory neurons could be therapeutically relevant, but causality remains to be established. <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>
</clinical>
</detailedSummary>

<researchImplications>
This study provides a high-resolution atlas of excitatory neuron subtype vulnerability in C9-ALS, highlighting upper-layer (L2/3) neurons as the most transcriptionally disrupted. The marker genes and subtypes identified align with recent large-scale human cortex atlases, supporting the robustness of the classification (<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>). Open questions include whether the observed upregulation of proteostasis and mitochondrial genes is protective or maladaptive, and how these changes relate to neuronal loss and clinical progression. The lack of spatial or longitudinal data limits inference about disease trajectories. The study’s findings diverge from some prior reports of mitochondrial protein loss in ALS, suggesting possible compensatory transcriptional upregulation in surviving neurons (<contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>: Authors note that upregulation of mitochondrial genes may reflect adaptation in surviving neurons, contrasting with prior reports of mitochondrial loss at the protein level). Future work should integrate spatial transcriptomics, longitudinal sampling, and functional studies to clarify the causal role of excitatory neuron subtype changes in ALS/FTD pathogenesis and to identify potential therapeutic targets.

Disease focus: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on postmortem motor/premotor cortex from 5 sporadic ALS (sALS) patients and 3 age-matched controls. Drop-seq technology was used, with ~79,000 nuclei analyzed after quality control. Cell types were annotated using canonical markers, and excitatory neurons were further subclustered. Validation included spatial transcriptomics, in vitro human iPSC-derived neuron models, and protein-level assays.
</methods>

<findings>
The study provides a detailed dissection of excitatory neuron heterogeneity in the ALS cortex, with a particular focus on extratelencephalic neurons (ETNs), especially those expressing THY1, which are known to be selectively vulnerable in ALS.

**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Identification**
Excitatory neurons comprised the largest cell population (~41–44% of nuclei). Unbiased clustering identified seven excitatory neuron subtypes (Exc0–Exc6), each corresponding to distinct cortical layers. Three subtypes—Exc1, Exc5, and Exc6—were identified as ETNs based on high expression of subcerebral projection neuron markers (e.g., FEZF2, BCL11B, CRYM), with Exc1 specifically expressing THY1, SERPINE2, POU3F1, NEFH, and STMN2. These markers are consistent with human layer V Betz cells and von Economo neurons, which are implicated in ALS–FTD pathology. <keyFinding priority='1'>Exc1 (THY1+ ETNs) is the principal ALS-vulnerable excitatory neuron subtype, defined by THY1, SERPINE2, POU3F1, NEFH, and STMN2 expression.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Genetic Risk Factor Enrichment**
Module scoring revealed that ALS–FTD genetic risk genes are constitutively and significantly more highly expressed in Exc1 (THY1+ ETNs) than in other excitatory or non-neuronal cell types, regardless of disease status. This enrichment was not observed for AD or MS risk genes, which were instead enriched in microglia. <keyFinding priority='1'>ALS–FTD risk gene expression is intrinsically elevated in THY1+ ETNs, independent of diagnosis.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Disease-Associated Transcriptional Changes**
In ALS patients, ETN subtypes (Exc1, Exc5, Exc6) showed a pronounced upregulation of genes involved in protein homeostasis, unfolded protein response, RNA metabolism, and cellular stress pathways (e.g., chaperones, proteasome subunits, mitochondrial genes). These changes were highly correlated across ETN subtypes and with the global ALS excitatory neuron signature. <keyFinding priority='1'>ALS ETNs exhibit a shared, robust induction of proteostasis and stress-response genes, including heat-shock proteins and proteasome components.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Subtype-Specific Features**
- **Exc1 (THY1+ ETNs):** Highest ALS–FTD risk gene module score; expresses THY1, SERPINE2, POU3F1, NEFH, STMN2; upregulates stress/proteostasis genes in ALS.
- **Exc5/Exc6:** Express FEZF2, BCL11B, CRYM; also show ALS–FTD risk gene enrichment and stress pathway activation.
- **Upper-layer subtypes (Exc0–Exc4):** Less affected; upregulated genes in ALS were more related to synaptic biology and less to proteostasis.

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**
Spatial transcriptomics confirmed that Exc1 marker genes and top ALS–FTD risk genes are localized to cortical layer V, aligning with the anatomical distribution of Betz cells and von Economo neurons. <keyFinding priority='2'>Spatial data validate the deep-layer (L5) localization of ALS-vulnerable ETNs.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Disease Trajectories and Modulators**
No evidence for major shifts in ETN subtype proportions between ALS and controls, but a clear increase in stress-response gene expression in ALS. The study did not identify strong demographic or genetic modulators (e.g., sex, age, APOE) within the small cohort, but inter-individual variability was noted.

**Validation and Mechanistic Insights**
In vitro modeling using human iPSC-derived neurons subjected to proteasome inhibition recapitulated the upregulation of proteostasis and stress-response genes seen in ALS ETNs, including overlap with genes dysregulated by TDP-43 loss. Protein-level assays in ALS cortex confirmed increased insoluble TDP-43 and accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, supporting impaired proteostasis as a key feature of ETN vulnerability.

**Gene Regulatory Networks and Cell-Cell Communication**
No specific transcription factors or ligand-receptor pairs were highlighted as unique to ETNs in this study, but the upregulation of stress and proteostasis pathways suggests convergence on common regulatory networks.

**Integration with Other Cell Types**
The study also found coordinated changes in oligodendrocytes (loss of myelination genes, shift to neuronally engaged state) and microglia (endolysosomal activation), but these were not the primary focus for excitatory neuron subtypes.

</findings>

<clinical>
The selective vulnerability of THY1+ ETNs (Betz cells) in ALS is linked to their intrinsic high expression of ALS–FTD risk genes and a pronounced, disease-associated induction of proteostasis and stress-response pathways. These molecular features may predispose ETNs to TDP-43 aggregation and degeneration, providing a mechanistic explanation for their early and selective loss in ALS. The findings suggest that targeting proteostasis and stress-response pathways in ETNs could be a therapeutic strategy, and that THY1+ ETNs may serve as a cellular biomarker for ALS progression. However, causal relationships remain associative due to the cross-sectional nature of the data. <keyFinding priority='1'>ETN-intrinsic molecular properties, especially high ALS–FTD risk gene expression and stress pathway activation, may underlie selective neuronal vulnerability in ALS.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</clinical>

---

**Quick Reference**

This study identifies THY1+ extratelencephalic excitatory neurons (ETNs, including Betz cells) as the principal ALS-vulnerable subtype in human cortex, defined by high expression of THY1, SERPINE2, POU3F1, NEFH, and STMN2. These neurons intrinsically express ALS–FTD risk genes at elevated levels and, in ALS, show robust upregulation of proteostasis and stress-response pathways. Spatial transcriptomics confirm their localization to layer V. No major demographic or genetic modulators were identified within this small cohort.

---

**Research Implications**

The identification of THY1+ ETNs as the main locus of ALS–FTD risk gene expression and stress pathway activation provides a mechanistic link between genetic susceptibility and selective neuronal degeneration in ALS. This aligns with, and extends, prior models implicating Betz cells and deep-layer projection neurons in ALS, but adds single-nucleus resolution and direct evidence of risk gene enrichment. The findings support the hypothesis that intrinsic molecular properties—rather than external factors alone—drive selective vulnerability. Open questions include whether these signatures are present in presymptomatic individuals, how they evolve over disease progression, and whether similar mechanisms operate in familial ALS or other neurodegenerative diseases. The study's small sample size and cross-sectional design limit causal inference and generalizability, but the results are consistent with recent single-cell studies in ALS and FTD. Future work should expand cohort size, integrate genetic stratification, and employ longitudinal or spatially resolved approaches to clarify the temporal dynamics and therapeutic potential of targeting ETN-specific stress pathways. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Disease focus: Schizophrenia and aging (human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex)
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA46) samples from 191 human donors (aged 22–97), including 97 controls and 94 with schizophrenia. Nuclei were pooled and demultiplexed by donor using transcribed SNPs. Cell types and subtypes were annotated using established marker genes and reference datasets. Latent factor analysis (PEER) and consensus non-negative matrix factorization (cNMF) were used to identify multicellular gene expression programs. Validation included protein-level data and spatial/morphological analyses from prior literature.
</methods>

<findings>
The study’s central discovery is a multicellular gene expression program termed the "synaptic neuron and astrocyte program" (SNAP), which is co-expressed in both excitatory (glutamatergic) neurons and astrocytes, and declines with both aging and schizophrenia. 

**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Excitatory neurons (glutamatergic) comprised 43% of all nuclei. No significant changes in the overall proportion of excitatory neuron subtypes were reported between controls and schizophrenia or with age.

**Differential Gene Expression & Pathway Enrichment:**  
Within excitatory neurons, SNAP is characterized by coordinated upregulation of genes involved in synaptic function, particularly the synaptic vesicle cycle and presynaptic compartment. Key upregulated genes include STX1A, SNAP25, SYP, SYT11, RAB3A, RPH3A, SV2A, and SYN1, as well as postsynaptic signaling proteins (PAK1, GSK3B, CAMK4) and ion channels/receptors (CACNG8, KCNN2, CHRNB2, GRM2, GRIA3).  
<keyFinding priority='1'>The expression of these synaptic genes is reduced in excitatory neurons from individuals with schizophrenia and with advancing age, indicating a loss of synaptic gene investment in both conditions.</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
Excitatory neurons were further resolved into canonical cortical subtypes (e.g., L2/3 IT, L4 IT, L5 IT, L6 CT, L6 IT), as per established taxonomies.  
<keyFinding priority='2'>All major excitatory neuron subtypes (L2/3 IT, L4 IT, L5 IT, L6 CT, L6 IT) showed a significant reduction in the fraction of gene expression devoted to synaptic vesicle cycle genes in schizophrenia and with age, with no evidence for a selective vulnerability of a particular subtype.</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Functional Signature:**  
The SNAP program in excitatory neurons is functionally defined by genes involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis, presynaptic machinery, and postsynaptic signaling.  
<keyFinding priority='1'>The decline in SNAP expression in excitatory neurons is tightly correlated with a parallel decline in astrocytic SNAP expression, suggesting a coordinated neuron–astrocyte program supporting synaptic function and plasticity.</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
Both schizophrenia diagnosis and increasing age independently predict lower SNAP expression in excitatory neurons, with no significant effect of sex, medication use, or technical variables.  
<keyFinding priority='1'>Higher polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia are associated with lower SNAP expression in excitatory neurons, even among controls, indicating a genetic contribution to this program’s regulation.</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Gene Regulatory Networks:**  
In excitatory neurons, SNAP expression is associated with activity of the JUNB (AP-1) regulon, which is known to be activity-dependent and may reflect overall neuronal activity levels.

**Cell-Cell Communication:**  
The study highlights the tight coupling between excitatory neuron and astrocyte SNAP expression, but does not identify specific ligand-receptor pairs.

**Spatial Analysis:**  
No new spatial or morphological validation is presented for excitatory neuron subtypes in this study, but the findings are consistent with prior reports of reduced dendritic spine density in schizophrenia and aging.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
The decline in SNAP expression is continuous across the adult lifespan and is not restricted to late-life or disease, suggesting a graded loss of synaptic gene investment with both normal aging and schizophrenia.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
Genes dynamically recruited by SNAP in excitatory neurons are highly enriched for common and rare schizophrenia risk variants, supporting the relevance of this program to disease pathogenesis.

</findings>

<clinical>
The study provides strong evidence that a coordinated decline in synaptic gene expression in excitatory neurons (and astrocytes) underlies aspects of cognitive impairment in both schizophrenia and aging. The SNAP program may represent a core axis of neurobiological variation relevant to cognitive flexibility and plasticity.  
<keyFinding priority='1'>Because SNAP expression is associated with genetic risk for schizophrenia and declines in both disease and aging, it may serve as a convergent mechanism for cognitive deficits and a potential target for therapeutic intervention or biomarker development.</keyFinding>

This study identifies a concerted gene expression program (SNAP) in excitatory neurons and astrocytes of the human prefrontal cortex, characterized by high expression of synaptic genes (e.g., STX1A, SNAP25, SYP). SNAP expression declines with both aging and schizophrenia, affecting all major excitatory neuron subtypes. The reduction is tightly coupled to astrocytic SNAP expression and is associated with higher schizophrenia polygenic risk. These findings suggest that loss of coordinated synaptic gene investment in excitatory neurons is a key feature of cognitive decline in both conditions, with genetic risk as a major modulator.

---

**Research Implications (≈150 words):**  
This work establishes SNAP as a multicellular program linking excitatory neuron and astrocyte gene expression, with direct relevance to synaptic function, cognitive aging, and schizophrenia. The finding that all major excitatory neuron subtypes are similarly affected suggests a global, rather than subtype-specific, vulnerability. The enrichment of schizophrenia risk variants among SNAP genes in excitatory neurons supports the hypothesis that genetic risk converges on synaptic maintenance pathways. Open questions include the molecular mechanisms coordinating SNAP across cell types, the causal directionality of neuron–astrocyte interactions, and whether interventions can restore SNAP expression to improve cognitive outcomes. The study’s results align with prior models of synaptic loss in schizophrenia and aging, but newly highlight the quantitative, continuous nature of this decline and its genetic underpinnings. No explicit contradictions with prior data are discussed by the authors. Future work should address whether SNAP is present in other brain regions and its relationship to synaptic structure and function in vivo.

# summary for Macnair 2024 (excitatory neurons)

<metadata>
Macnair et al., 2025, Neuron. "snRNA-seq stratifies multiple sclerosis patients into distinct white matter glial responses."
Disease focus: Multiple sclerosis (MS), with comparative analysis of white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) pathology.
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on 632,000 nuclei from 156 post-mortem brain samples (WM and GM) from 54 MS patients and 28 controls. Both lesion and non-lesion regions were sampled, including various MS lesion subtypes. Data integration and clustering identified major cell types and subtypes. Differential abundance and gene expression analyses were performed using pseudobulk and mixed models, with validation in an independent cohort and by RNAscope in situ hybridization.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Identification**
Excitatory neurons were systematically profiled in cortical GM, where 14 distinct subtypes were identified, corresponding to canonical cortical layers (e.g., CUX2+ [layer 2], RORB+ [layers 3/5], TLE4+ [layers 5/6]). These subtypes were defined by established marker genes, with no novel excitatory neuron subtypes unique to MS described. The study confirmed prior findings of selective vulnerability among excitatory neuron subtypes in MS, particularly in demyelinated GM lesions (GMLs).

**Subtype-Specific Changes and Disease Associations**
In MS GM, especially in GMLs, there was a pronounced reduction in the abundance of upper and mid-layer excitatory neurons, consistent with previous reports of neuronal loss in MS cortex. This reduction was more marked in GMLs than in adjacent normal-appearing GM (NAGM), and was accompanied by a loss of specific inhibitory neuron subtypes (e.g., PVALB+, SST+), suggesting a broad vulnerability of excitatory circuits in demyelinated cortex. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> The loss of excitatory neurons in GMLs is robustly supported by both compositional and gene expression analyses, and is consistent with prior studies.</keyFinding>

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**
Excitatory neurons in GMLs exhibited upregulation of genes involved in glutamate signaling (GRIA1, GRIA2, GRIA4, GRIN2B, GRM1, GRM5), glucose and cation homeostasis (SLC2A12, SLC22A10), and downregulation of voltage-gated sodium and potassium channels (SCN1A, SCN1B, SCN2B, SCN4B, KCNA1, KCNA2, KCNC1) as well as oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) genes (ATP1A1, ATP1B1, NDUFB10, NDUFS3, UQCRH). <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> This transcriptional signature suggests a shift toward increased excitatory drive and metabolic stress, potentially predisposing to excitotoxicity in MS GM lesions.</keyFinding>

Gene ontology analysis highlighted enrichment for pathways related to glutamatergic neurotransmission, ion homeostasis, and mitochondrial dysfunction in excitatory neurons from GMLs. These changes were not observed to the same extent in NAGM or control GM, indicating a lesion-specific effect.

**Functional and Disease Mechanistic Implications**
The upregulation of glutamate receptor genes and concurrent downregulation of inhibitory and metabolic genes in excitatory neurons may contribute to excitotoxic neuronal injury in MS cortex. The authors propose that this imbalance, together with the loss of inhibitory neurons, could drive neurodegeneration in MS GM. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> While the association is strong, causality is inferred from cross-sectional data and requires further validation.</keyFinding>

**Modulators and Metrics**
No significant associations were reported between excitatory neuron subtype changes and patient demographic or genetic variables (e.g., age, sex, MS subtype, APOE status). The primary driver of excitatory neuron pathology appeared to be the presence of demyelinated lesions rather than host factors.

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**
The study did not report specific spatial transcriptomic or morphological validation for excitatory neuron subtypes beyond snRNA-seq clustering and marker gene expression. However, the loss of excitatory neurons in GMLs was consistent with prior immunohistochemical and histological studies.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**
No explicit pseudotime or trajectory analysis was performed for excitatory neurons. The observed changes are interpreted as cross-sectional differences between lesion types and controls.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**
No direct integration with GWAS or eQTL data for excitatory neuron subtypes was reported.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> The findings for excitatory neurons are consistent with prior single-nucleus and histopathological studies of MS cortex, with no explicit contradictions discussed.
</findings>

<clinical>
Excitatory neuron loss and altered gene expression in MS GM lesions are strongly associated with cortical demyelination and may underlie cognitive and functional deficits in progressive MS. The upregulation of glutamatergic signaling and downregulation of metabolic and inhibitory pathways in excitatory neurons may contribute to excitotoxicity and neurodegeneration. These findings suggest that targeting glutamate-mediated excitotoxicity or supporting neuronal metabolism could be therapeutic strategies in progressive MS, though direct causal links remain to be established. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> The potential for excitatory neuron-derived biomarkers in CSF or imaging is suggested but not directly validated in this study.</clinical>

---

**Quick Reference**
In this large snRNA-seq study of MS brain, excitatory neurons in cortical gray matter were divided into 14 canonical subtypes, with pronounced loss of upper/mid-layer excitatory neurons and upregulation of glutamate receptor genes in demyelinated lesions. These changes were lesion-specific and not driven by age, sex, or MS subtype, highlighting excitatory neuron vulnerability as a key feature of MS cortical pathology.

---

**Research Implications**
This study reinforces the selective vulnerability of excitatory neurons—particularly upper and mid-layer subtypes—in MS cortical lesions, with transcriptional signatures indicating increased excitatory drive and metabolic stress. The findings align with previous reports of neuronal loss and excitotoxicity in MS cortex, supporting the hypothesis that altered glutamatergic signaling contributes to neurodegeneration. Open questions remain regarding the temporal sequence of excitatory neuron loss, the interplay with inhibitory circuits, and the potential for neuroprotective interventions targeting glutamate signaling or mitochondrial function. The lack of novel excitatory neuron subtypes or strong genetic/demographic modulators suggests that lesion environment is the primary determinant of excitatory neuron pathology in MS. Future studies integrating spatial transcriptomics, longitudinal sampling, and functional validation will be critical to clarify causality and therapeutic potential. No explicit conflicts with prior classification schemes or models were discussed by the authors.

# summary for Marinaro 2020 (excitatory neurons)

1) **Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This study used single-nucleus RNA sequencing of frontal cortex from monogenic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients (PSEN1/APP mutations) and matched controls to reveal a broad loss of excitatory neurons, with especially pronounced depletion of layer 3/4 (ExcB1) and layer 4-6 (ExcB4) subtypes. Excitatory neurons in AD exhibited widespread downregulation of synaptic transmission genes and mitochondrial metabolism, alongside upregulation of glycolytic pathways, indicating metabolic reprogramming. Several AD GWAS risk genes (e.g., CLU, ABCA7, BIN1) were upregulated in excitatory neurons, while others (SORL1, PICALM) were downregulated. These changes were consistent across both PSEN1 and APP mutation carriers.

Disease focus: Monogenic (familial) Alzheimer’s disease (PSEN1 and APP mutations)
</metadata>

<methods>
The authors performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on post-mortem frontal cortex (Brodmann area 9) from 8 individuals with monogenic AD (4 PSEN1, 4 APP mutations) and 8 age- and gender-matched controls. Neuronal (NeuN+) and glial (NeuN-) nuclei were sorted by FACS to ensure balanced representation. Cell types were annotated using the Allen Institute’s human middle temporal gyrus reference. Immunostaining and cell counting validated cell loss findings.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions:**  
The study found a significant reduction in both excitatory and inhibitory neurons in monogenic AD cortex compared to controls, with glial proportions relatively increased, likely reflecting neuronal loss. Among excitatory neurons, the most pronounced reductions were observed in layer 3/4 (ExcB1) and layer 4-6 (ExcB4) subtypes (<keyFinding priority='1'>ExcB1 and ExcB4 excitatory neuron subtypes are disproportionately lost in monogenic AD</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>). This was confirmed by immunostaining for excitatory neuron markers (SATB2, TBR1), which showed significant reductions in AD cortex.

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
Excitatory neurons were classified into multiple subtypes based on layer and marker gene expression (see Figure 1D, F). The main subtypes included:
- ExcA (L2-3, marker: FREM3)
- ExcB1 (L3-4, marker: RORB)
- ExcB2 (L3-5, marker: RORB)
- ExcB3 (L3-6, marker: RORB)
- ExcB4 (L4-6, marker: RORB)
- ExcC1/C2 (L4-6, FEZF2/ABO)
- ExcD1/D2 (L5-6, THEMIS/CRABP1)

Among these, ExcB1 and ExcB4 showed the most significant proportional loss in AD (<keyFinding priority='1'>Layer 3/4 and 4-6 excitatory neurons (ExcB1, ExcB4) are selectively vulnerable</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>). Other subtypes (ExcA, ExcB2, ExcB3, ExcC1, ExcC2, ExcD1, ExcD2) did not show significant changes.

**Differential Gene Expression:**  
Excitatory neurons in AD exhibited a global downregulation of genes involved in synaptic transmission, including both pre- and post-synaptic components (e.g., RIMS1, SYN1, GRIN2A, GRIK2, GRIK1, GRIK4, GRIK5, GABRA1, GABRA2, GABRB2, GABRG2) (<keyFinding priority='1'>Widespread downregulation of synaptic transmission genes in excitatory neurons</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>). Both glutamatergic and GABAergic receptor genes were affected, suggesting impaired excitatory and inhibitory neurotransmission.

**Pathway Enrichment:**  
Pathway analysis revealed significant downregulation of mitochondrial electron transport chain genes (e.g., NDUFA4, NDUFS1, COX6A, ATP5F1E) and Krebs cycle enzymes (e.g., DLD, SUCLA2, SDHB), indicating mitochondrial dysfunction and impaired oxidative phosphorylation (<keyFinding priority='1'>Excitatory neurons show marked downregulation of mitochondrial and TCA cycle genes</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>). In parallel, there was upregulation of glycolytic genes (e.g., HK1, PFKL, GAPDH, ENO1, ENO2) and HIF-1 pathway targets, consistent with a metabolic shift toward glycolysis (<keyFinding priority='2'>Upregulation of glycolytic and HIF-1 pathway genes in excitatory neurons</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>). This metabolic reprogramming resembles the Warburg effect seen in cancer and immune cell activation.

**AD GWAS Gene Expression:**  
Several genes identified as risk factors for sporadic AD by GWAS were differentially expressed in excitatory neurons. Notably, CLU (clusterin), PTK2B, ABCA7, and BIN1 were upregulated, while SORL1, PICALM, CNTNAP2, and MEF2C were downregulated (<keyFinding priority='2'>AD GWAS genes show subtype-specific up- and downregulation in excitatory neurons</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>). These changes may have both protective and pathogenic consequences, as discussed by the authors.

**Cell-Cell Communication:**  
Analysis of ligand-receptor co-expression revealed an overall decrease in potential neuron-neuron signaling in AD, but increased neuron-microglia and neuron-astrocyte signaling. For excitatory neurons, there was increased expression of the SORT1 receptor (for microglial GRN ligand), potentially enhancing lysosomal function, but decreased expression of neuregulins (NRG1-3) and their receptors (ERBB4, EGFR), suggesting impaired neuron-glia communication (<keyFinding priority='2'>Excitatory neurons show altered intercellular signaling, with both adaptive and deleterious changes</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
The study is cross-sectional, but the authors note that the widespread transcriptional changes and metabolic reprogramming in excitatory neurons are consistent with a disease process that begins in early adulthood and progresses over decades.

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
No explicit analysis of genetic modifiers (e.g., APOE genotype) or demographic effects on excitatory neuron subtypes was reported. The findings were consistent across both PSEN1 and APP mutation carriers.

**Morphological/Spatial Validation:**  
Immunostaining for SATB2 and TBR1 confirmed the loss of excitatory neurons in AD cortex, supporting the snRNA-seq findings (<keyFinding priority='2'>Morphological validation confirms selective loss of excitatory neuron subtypes</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

</findings>

<clinical>
Excitatory neuron loss and dysfunction are central to the pathogenesis of monogenic AD. The selective vulnerability of layer 3/4 and 4-6 excitatory neurons may underlie early cognitive deficits. Downregulation of synaptic and metabolic genes in these neurons likely contributes to impaired neurotransmission and energy metabolism, potentially exacerbating neurodegeneration. The observed metabolic reprogramming may represent an adaptive response to mitochondrial dysfunction, but could also be maladaptive. Differential expression of AD GWAS genes in excitatory neurons suggests overlap between monogenic and sporadic AD mechanisms. These findings highlight excitatory neuron subtypes and their molecular pathways as potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers, though causal relationships remain to be established (<keyFinding priority='1'>Excitatory neuron dysfunction is strongly associated with disease progression and may offer therapeutic entry points</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).
</clinical>

---

3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study provides a detailed atlas of excitatory neuron vulnerability and molecular pathology in monogenic AD, revealing both shared and unique features compared to sporadic AD. The pronounced loss of specific excitatory neuron subtypes (ExcB1, ExcB4) and their transcriptional reprogramming suggest that targeting metabolic and synaptic pathways in these cells could be a promising therapeutic strategy. The up- and downregulation of AD GWAS genes in excitatory neurons supports the relevance of these pathways across AD forms. Open questions include whether the observed metabolic shift is protective or pathogenic, and how early these changes arise in disease progression. The study’s findings align with prior reports of excitatory neuron loss in AD, but provide new granularity at the subtype level. Future work should address the temporal sequence of these changes, their reversibility, and their presence in sporadic AD. No explicit contradictions with prior models were discussed by the authors (<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**

Martirosyan et al. (2024) provide a comprehensive snRNA-seq atlas of the human SNpc in Parkinson’s disease, revealing six excitatory neuronal subpopulations. The most PD-vulnerable subtype, Neurons0, is dopaminergic (TH+, SLC6A3+, SNCA+, ALDH1A1+) and is significantly depleted in PD, with AGTR1 expression marking high vulnerability. Another depleted subtype, Neurons3, is GABAergic (GAD1+, GAD2+). Disease-associated changes in Neurons0 include downregulation of genes involved in glucose metabolism and vesicle trafficking. The vulnerability of Neurons0 is linked to both disease status and AGTR1 expression, echoing prior findings of AGTR1 as a marker of PD-susceptible neurons.

**Detailed Summary (≈800–1000 words):**

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and General Patterns:**  
Excitatory neurons (broadly defined as neurons in this study) constitute ~7.4% of all nuclei in the SNpc dataset. There is a marked and statistically significant depletion of neuronal nuclei in PD samples compared to controls (<keyFinding priority='1'>This depletion is most pronounced in the Neurons0 and Neurons3 subpopulations</keyFinding>), with a corresponding increase in glial and T cell proportions. <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Excitatory Neuron Subtype Identification and Characterization:**  
Re-clustering of the neuronal population identified six subpopulations (Neurons0–Neurons5), each with distinct marker gene profiles and functional signatures.

- **Neurons0 (Dopaminergic, PD-vulnerable):**  
  - **Markers:** TH, SLC6A3, SNCA, ALDH1A1, SLC18A2, KCNJ6, PEG10, AGTR1.
  - **Functional signature:** Dopaminergic neuron identity; high AGTR1 expression (previously linked to PD vulnerability).
  - **Disease association:** Profoundly depleted in PD samples (<keyFinding priority='1'>Neurons0 is the principal population lost in PD</keyFinding>), with AGTR1 marking the most vulnerable subset. <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
  - **Pathways:** Over-representation of energy production (ATP1B1, ENO1/2), cholesterol metabolism (DHCR24, CYB5R3, HDLBP), iron transport (FTL, FTH1, SLC22A17), oxidative stress (CHCHD10, CLU, SOD1), and unfolded protein response (UPR; HSPA8, HSP90AA1).
  - **Differential expression in PD:** 20 significant DEGs, including downregulation of OGA and CHST1 (glucose metabolism), KBTBD6 (ubiquitin-proteasome), and dysregulation of RAB6B, RAB8B, COG4 (Golgi-ER vesicle trafficking). <keyFinding priority='2'>These changes suggest early metabolic and proteostatic dysfunction in PD neurons</keyFinding>. <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>
  - **Spatial validation:** Spatial transcriptomics confirmed the presence and depletion of TH+ neurons in PD. <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
  - **Genetic drivers:** AGTR1 expression marks the most PD-vulnerable DA neurons, consistent with prior studies. <keyFinding priority='1'>AGTR1 is a robust marker of PD-susceptible DA neurons</keyFinding>. <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

- **Neurons3 (GABAergic, PD-vulnerable):**  
  - **Markers:** GAD1, GAD2, GABRA1, GABRB2, heat shock proteins (HSPA, HSP90), SYT11, KCNA2, ABAT.
  - **Functional signature:** GABAergic inhibitory neuron identity; also expresses UPR and oxidative stress markers.
  - **Disease association:** Significantly depleted in PD. <keyFinding priority='2'>GABAergic neurons are also vulnerable in PD</keyFinding>. <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
  - **Differential expression in PD:** Upregulation of NEAT1 (lncRNA, previously shown to be upregulated in PD) and CA2 (linked to aging/neurodegeneration). <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>
  - **Pathways:** UPR, oxidative stress, energy production, iron transport.

- **Neurons2 and Neurons4 (PD-enriched):**  
  - **Markers:** Neurons4: SLC44A1 (choline transporter); Neurons2: HTR2C (serotonin receptor).
  - **Functional signature:** Not dopaminergic or GABAergic; enriched for GTPase activity.
  - **Disease association:** Over-represented in PD samples. <keyFinding priority='2'>These subtypes may represent stress-adapted or reactive states</keyFinding>. <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>
  - **Differential expression in PD:** Neurons2 upregulates CAMK2G (calmodulin-dependent kinase); Neurons4 upregulates ANAPC16, HP1BP3, SEPT8.

- **Neurons1 and Neurons5:**  
  - Less clearly characterized; not strongly associated with PD status or specific functional pathways.

**Pathway Enrichment and Disease Mechanisms:**  
- Neurons0 and Neurons3 are enriched for UPR, oxidative stress, and metabolic pathways, suggesting shared mechanisms of vulnerability.
- Downregulation of genes involved in glucose metabolism and vesicle trafficking in Neurons0 is consistent with early PD pathology and alpha-synuclein toxicity models. <keyFinding priority='2'>These findings support a model of metabolic and proteostatic stress as early drivers of neuronal loss in PD</keyFinding>. <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>

**Genetic and Multi-omic Integration:**  
- Neurons0 is enriched for monogenic PD genes (e.g., SNCA, PARK7, PINK1, ATP13A2, VPS35, SYNJ1).
- GWAS integration (MAGMA) shows overlap of Neurons0 markers with genes near PD-associated variants (e.g., SNCA), but no single cell type shows significant overall enrichment. <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>
- Spatial transcriptomics confirms cell type-specific expression patterns for key PD genes.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
- The study is cross-sectional; however, the depletion of Neurons0 and Neurons3 in PD, and the over-representation of Neurons2/4, suggests a shift from vulnerable to stress-adapted neuronal states as disease progresses. <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>
</findings>

<clinical>
Excitatory neurons—specifically the dopaminergic Neurons0 subtype—are the principal cell type lost in PD SNpc, with AGTR1 expression marking the most vulnerable population. The molecular signature of Neurons0 in PD includes metabolic, proteostatic, and vesicle trafficking dysfunction, supporting their central role in disease pathogenesis. GABAergic Neurons3 are also depleted, suggesting broader neurotransmitter system involvement. The identification of stress-adapted neuronal subtypes (Neurons2/4) enriched in PD may reflect compensatory or maladaptive responses. These findings reinforce the importance of targeting metabolic and proteostatic pathways in PD and highlight AGTR1 as a potential marker for vulnerable neurons. <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words):**

This study provides a high-resolution map of excitatory neuron heterogeneity in the human SNpc, confirming and extending previous findings that AGTR1+ dopaminergic neurons are the most PD-vulnerable population. The identification of distinct neuronal subtypes with differential vulnerability and molecular signatures (e.g., Neurons0 vs. Neurons2/4) raises important questions about the mechanisms driving selective neuronal loss and the potential for subtype-specific therapeutic targeting. The overlap of Neurons0 markers with monogenic PD genes and GWAS loci supports their centrality in disease, but the lack of strong GWAS enrichment for any single cell type suggests complex, multi-cellular contributions to PD risk. The study’s integration of spatial transcriptomics validates the snRNA-seq findings and demonstrates the utility of multi-modal approaches. Open questions include the functional significance of stress-adapted neuronal subtypes, the causal role of AGTR1, and the interplay between neuronal and glial vulnerability. The authors note that their findings are consistent with, but also extend, prior classification schemes (e.g., Kamath et al., 2022), and no explicit contradictions with previous models are discussed. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Detailed Summary (≈800–1000 words)**

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Structure**  
Excitatory neurons (Ex), marked by NRGN, SLC17A7, and CAMK2A, comprised ~50% of all nuclei. Subclustering revealed 13 transcriptionally distinct excitatory neuron subpopulations (Ex0–Ex12), each with unique marker gene signatures and partial correspondence to cortical layer identities.

**Subtype Characterization**  
- **Ex4 (AD-associated):**  
  - **Defining markers:** LINGO1 (up), RASGEF1B (up), SLC26A3 (up), CAMK2N1, GRIN1, PTK2B, DHFR, PRNP, PHYHIP, TSPYL1.
  - **Functional signature:** Downregulation of synaptic, axonal, and plasticity-related genes (e.g., NTNG1, BEX1, CNTNAP2, NEGR1, ERBIN), and upregulation of LINGO1, a negative regulator of axonal integrity and myelination.
  - **Disease association:** Strongly overrepresented in AD-pathology individuals (enrichment confirmed by hypergeometric test, FDR < 0.01). Ex4 marker gene expression correlates with amyloid burden, neurofibrillary tangle load, and cognitive decline.
  - **Spatial validation:** RNA in situ hybridization showed a significant reduction in NTNG1+ excitatory neurons in AD brains, supporting the loss of axonal outgrowth capacity in Ex4.
  - **Sex bias:** Ex4 is enriched in female AD cases, with higher expression of AD-associated markers in females. <keyFinding priority='2'>Sex-specific transcriptional repression in Ex4 is more pronounced in females.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>
  - **Temporal dynamics:** Ex4 overrepresentation and transcriptional changes are evident in early AD pathology, preceding severe neurofibrillary tangle accumulation and cognitive impairment. <keyFinding priority='2'>Excitatory neuron repression is an early event in AD.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
  - **Pathway enrichment:** Downregulation of genes involved in axon guidance, synaptic transmission, and myelination; upregulation of stress response and protein folding pathways in late-stage pathology.

- **Ex6 (No-pathology associated):**  
  - **Defining markers:** Not specified in detail, but enriched in control brains.
  - **Functional signature:** Presumed homeostatic or baseline excitatory neuron state.
  - **Disease association:** Depleted in AD-pathology individuals.

**Other Subtypes:**  
Other excitatory neuron subpopulations (Ex0–Ex3, Ex5, Ex7–Ex12) did not show strong or consistent associations with AD pathology or clinical traits. Their marker genes and functional signatures were not highlighted as disease-relevant in this study.

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathways**  
- **Directionality:** 75% of DEGs in excitatory neurons were downregulated in AD, indicating a dominant transcriptional repression.
- **Key downregulated genes:** NTNG1, BEX1, CNTNAP2, NEGR1, ERBIN (all involved in axonal outgrowth, synaptic function, or myelination).
- **Key upregulated genes:** LINGO1 (negative regulator of myelination and axonal integrity), RASGEF1B, SLC26A3.
- **Validation:** RT-qPCR and RNA in situ hybridization confirmed downregulation of NTNG1 and other DEGs in AD brains.
- **Pathway enrichment:** Myelination, axonal regeneration, synaptic plasticity, and stress response pathways were recurrently perturbed.

**Disease Progression and Trajectories**  
- **Early vs. late pathology:** Major transcriptional repression in excitatory neurons occurs early, with additional upregulation of stress response genes (e.g., HSP90AA1, HSPA1A) in late-stage AD, shared across cell types.
- **Gene–trait correlations:** Excitatory neuron gene expression modules negatively correlated with amyloid, tangle burden, and cognitive decline.

**Sex Differences**  
- **Transcriptional response:** Females with AD pathology showed a stronger global downregulation of excitatory neuron gene expression, particularly in Ex4, compared to males. This was not explained by differences in pathology severity or cell composition.
- **Clinical correlation:** In the broader ROSMAP cohort, white matter hyperintensity burden was more strongly associated with cognitive decline in females, consistent with reduced transcriptional resilience in excitatory neurons.

**Integration with Genetic Risk**  
- **GWAS overlap:** Some excitatory neuron gene modules negatively correlated with AD pathology overlapped with genes associated with general cognitive function, but not with AD GWAS risk loci, which were more enriched in microglial modules.

**Morphological/Spatial Validation**  
- **RNAscope and immunohistochemistry:** Confirmed loss of NTNG1+ excitatory neurons and validated cell type assignments.

This study provides a high-confidence, cell-type-resolved map of excitatory neuron heterogeneity in the aged human cortex, highlighting Ex4 as a principal AD-associated subtype. The early and cell-type-specific repression of synaptic and axonal genes, especially those involved in myelination and plasticity, suggests that excitatory neuron dysfunction is an initiating event in AD pathogenesis. The strong sex bias in transcriptional response raises important questions about mechanisms of female vulnerability or resilience, warranting further investigation in larger and more diverse cohorts. The identification of LINGO1 as a convergent marker and potential regulator of disease-associated excitatory neuron states aligns with prior knowledge of its role in myelination but extends its relevance to human AD. No explicit contradictions with prior classification schemes or models were discussed by the authors. Future work should address the causal role of Ex4 in neurodegeneration, its relationship to cortical layer identity, and the potential for targeting LINGO1 or related pathways therapeutically.

Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD), cognitive impairment, and resilience in the aged human prefrontal cortex.
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on >2.3 million nuclei from prefrontal cortex (PFC) tissue of 427 ROSMAP participants spanning the full spectrum of AD pathology and cognitive status. High-resolution clustering identified 14 excitatory neuron subtypes. Validation included comparison to other large snRNA-seq datasets (De Jager, SEA-AD), bulk RNA-seq, proteomics, RT-qPCR, and in situ hybridization.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Landscape**
Excitatory neurons comprised the largest cell class (44.2% of nuclei), with 14 transcriptionally distinct subtypes identified across cortical layers (see Figure S1E). The proportions of most excitatory neuron subtypes showed only subtle, non-significant decreases with AD progression, in contrast to more pronounced changes in certain inhibitory neuron subtypes.

**Consensus Disease-Associated Signatures Across Excitatory Neurons**
A major finding is the presence of highly conserved, AD-pathology-associated gene expression changes across nearly all excitatory neuron subtypes. This was supported by strong overlap of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between subtypes (see Figure 2G,H; S2D–G), and validated in independent datasets and brain regions (<keyFinding priority='1'>The AD-associated transcriptomic signature is robust and generalizable across excitatory neuron subtypes and cohorts.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Subtype Characterization**
All 14 excitatory neuron subtypes (Exc) were defined by canonical layer- and region-specific markers (see Figure S1E). The paper does not report the emergence of novel, disease-specific excitatory neuron subtypes, but rather emphasizes that AD-associated molecular changes are broadly shared across existing subtypes.

**Key Molecular Alterations in Excitatory Neurons**
- **Upregulated in AD:** Genes involved in neuron projection morphogenesis, mRNA metabolic processes (notably spliceosome components such as HNRNPA2B1, HNRNPH3), chromatin organization, and synaptic signaling (including both pre- and postsynaptic genes). Many synaptic genes (e.g., CACNG3, PAK1, NPTX2, RPH3A, SVOP, BDNF, VGF) were upregulated at the RNA level in AD, but proteomics showed a decrease, suggesting a possible compensatory or homeostatic response to synaptic loss (<keyFinding priority='2'>Upregulation of synaptic and mRNA processing genes may reflect a compensatory response to synaptic degeneration.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).
- **Downregulated in AD:** Genes involved in tRNA metabolism, lipid metabolism (notably BDH1, GPCPD1, MECR, TM7SF2), and mitochondrial function (including components of the mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging [MIB] complex). These changes were validated by RT-qPCR and proteomics, and suggest impaired metabolic and mitochondrial homeostasis in AD (<keyFinding priority='1'>Downregulation of lipid metabolism and mitochondrial genes is a robust feature of AD across excitatory neuron subtypes.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Cohesin Complex and DNA Damage Response**
A striking, coordinated increase in the expression of the cohesin complex (e.g., STAG1, SMC1A, SMC3) and DNA damage response genes (e.g., ATRX, ZBTB1, SIRT1, CHD1, BPTF, NIPBL, USP47, BAZ1B, CDKN2AIP, MACROD1) was observed across excitatory neuron subtypes in AD. This was validated by bulk RNA-seq, proteomics, and RT-qPCR. The authors interpret this as a response to increased DNA damage and chromatin instability in AD (<keyFinding priority='1'>Coordinated upregulation of cohesin and DNA damage response genes is a conserved, late-stage feature of AD in excitatory neurons.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Temporal and Spatial Patterns**
Gene expression changes in excitatory neurons were evident at both early and late stages of AD progression, with some molecular alterations (e.g., synaptic and chromatin genes) appearing earlier in the middle temporal gyrus than in the PFC, suggesting region-specific temporal dynamics. No spatially restricted or morphologically distinct excitatory neuron subpopulations were reported.

**Modulators & Metrics**
No strong evidence for selective vulnerability or resilience among specific excitatory neuron subtypes was found; rather, molecular changes were highly conserved. The study did not identify major effects of APOE genotype or other genetic risk factors on excitatory neuron subtypes, nor did it report significant associations with sex or diabetes after correcting for AD pathology.

**Gene Regulatory Networks**
The upregulated DNA damage response signature included several chromatin regulators and transcription factors, but the study did not identify a dominant, subtype-specific regulatory module unique to excitatory neurons.

**Cell-Cell Communication**
No major findings regarding altered ligand-receptor interactions involving excitatory neurons were highlighted.

**Integration with Clinical and Pathological Variables**
Genes upregulated in excitatory neurons in AD overlapped strongly with those associated with cognitive impairment, but the most striking cell-type compositional and resilience effects were observed in inhibitory neurons, not excitatory neurons.

</findings>

<clinical>
Excitatory neurons in the aged human PFC exhibit a highly conserved molecular response to AD pathology, characterized by upregulation of synaptic, mRNA processing, and DNA damage response genes, and downregulation of lipid metabolism and mitochondrial genes. These changes are strongly associated with cognitive impairment, but the study does not identify selectively vulnerable or resilient excitatory neuron subtypes. Instead, the molecular signatures are broadly shared, suggesting that excitatory neuron dysfunction in AD is a pan-cortical, subtype-conserved process. The upregulation of cohesin and DNA repair genes may reflect an attempt to maintain genome integrity in the face of accumulating DNA damage. While these findings highlight potential therapeutic targets (e.g., metabolic and chromatin maintenance pathways), the lack of subtype-specific vulnerability in excitatory neurons contrasts with the marked subtype-selective loss seen in certain inhibitory neuron populations.

**Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

Excitatory neurons in the aged human prefrontal cortex show a highly conserved, pan-subtype molecular response to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology, with upregulation of synaptic, mRNA processing, and DNA damage response genes (notably the cohesin complex), and downregulation of lipid metabolism and mitochondrial genes. These changes are robust across all 14 excitatory neuron subtypes and are strongly associated with cognitive impairment, but no selectively vulnerable or resilient excitatory neuron subtypes were identified. The cohesin/DNA repair signature is a key late-stage feature, independent of APOE genotype or other major genetic/demographic drivers.

**Detailed Summary (≈800–1000 words)**

This large-scale single-nucleus RNA-seq study of the aged human prefrontal cortex (PFC) provides a comprehensive atlas of cell-type and molecular changes associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD), cognitive impairment, and resilience. Focusing on excitatory neurons, the most abundant cell class in the dataset, the authors identified 14 transcriptionally distinct subtypes spanning all cortical layers. These subtypes were defined by canonical marker genes and aligned well with previously published human cortical neuron taxonomies (<keyFinding priority='2'>Subtype definitions are robust and consistent with prior single-cell atlases.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

A central finding is that AD-associated transcriptomic changes are highly conserved across all excitatory neuron subtypes. Differential gene expression analysis revealed a strong overlap of AD-pathology-associated genes between subtypes, with no evidence for the emergence of novel, disease-specific excitatory neuron states or for selective vulnerability or resilience among subtypes. This pan-subtype conservation was validated in independent snRNA-seq datasets from both the PFC and middle temporal gyrus, as well as by permutation testing and comparison to bulk RNA-seq and proteomics data (<keyFinding priority='1'>AD-associated molecular signatures are robust and generalizable across excitatory neuron subtypes and cohorts.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

The molecular signature of AD in excitatory neurons is characterized by:
- **Upregulation of genes involved in neuron projection morphogenesis, mRNA metabolic processes (notably spliceosome components such as HNRNPA2B1 and HNRNPH3), chromatin organization, and synaptic signaling.** Many of these synaptic genes (e.g., CACNG3, PAK1, NPTX2, RPH3A, SVOP, BDNF, VGF) are upregulated at the RNA level in AD, but proteomics data show a decrease in their protein levels, suggesting that the transcriptional upregulation may represent a compensatory or homeostatic response to synaptic degeneration (<keyFinding priority='2'>Upregulation of synaptic and mRNA processing genes may reflect a compensatory response to synaptic loss.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

- **Downregulation of genes involved in tRNA metabolism, lipid metabolism (notably BDH1, GPCPD1, MECR, TM7SF2), and mitochondrial function (including components of the mitochondrial intermembrane space bridging [MIB] complex).** These changes were validated by RT-qPCR and proteomics, and suggest impaired metabolic and mitochondrial homeostasis in AD (<keyFinding priority='1'>Downregulation of lipid metabolism and mitochondrial genes is a robust feature of AD across excitatory neuron subtypes.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

A particularly notable and novel finding is the **coordinated upregulation of the cohesin complex (e.g., STAG1, SMC1A, SMC3) and DNA damage response genes (e.g., ATRX, ZBTB1, SIRT1, CHD1, BPTF, NIPBL, USP47, BAZ1B, CDKN2AIP, MACROD1) across all excitatory neuron subtypes in AD**. This signature was validated by bulk RNA-seq, proteomics, and RT-qPCR, and was also observed in oligodendrocytes. The authors interpret this as a response to increased DNA damage and chromatin instability in AD, and suggest that maintenance of genome integrity becomes a major cellular priority in late-stage disease (<keyFinding priority='1'>Coordinated upregulation of cohesin and DNA damage response genes is a conserved, late-stage feature of AD in excitatory neurons.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

Temporal analysis showed that these molecular changes are evident at both early and late stages of AD progression, with some alterations (e.g., synaptic and chromatin genes) appearing earlier in the middle temporal gyrus than in the PFC, suggesting region-specific temporal dynamics. However, no spatially restricted or morphologically distinct excitatory neuron subpopulations were reported.

The study did not find strong evidence for selective vulnerability or resilience among excitatory neuron subtypes; rather, the molecular changes were highly conserved. No major effects of APOE genotype or other genetic risk factors on excitatory neuron subtypes were identified, nor were significant associations with sex or diabetes observed after correcting for AD pathology.

Gene regulatory network analysis highlighted the upregulation of several chromatin regulators and transcription factors as part of the DNA damage response, but no dominant, subtype-specific regulatory module unique to excitatory neurons was identified.

No major findings regarding altered ligand-receptor interactions involving excitatory neurons were reported.

Integration with clinical and pathological variables showed that genes upregulated in excitatory neurons in AD overlapped strongly with those associated with cognitive impairment, but the most striking cell-type compositional and resilience effects were observed in inhibitory neurons, not excitatory neurons.

In summary, the study demonstrates that excitatory neurons in the aged human PFC mount a highly conserved molecular response to AD pathology, characterized by upregulation of synaptic, mRNA processing, and DNA damage response genes, and downregulation of lipid metabolism and mitochondrial genes. These changes are strongly associated with cognitive impairment, but no selectively vulnerable or resilient excitatory neuron subtypes were identified. The cohesin/DNA repair signature is a key late-stage feature, independent of APOE genotype or other major genetic/demographic drivers.

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study establishes that excitatory neuron dysfunction in AD is driven by a highly conserved, pan-subtype molecular program, rather than by selective vulnerability or resilience of specific subtypes. The robust upregulation of cohesin and DNA damage response genes, alongside downregulation of metabolic and mitochondrial genes, suggests that genome maintenance and metabolic stress are central to excitatory neuron pathology in AD. These findings raise important questions about the triggers and consequences of the cohesin/DNA repair response, and whether targeting these pathways could mitigate neuronal dysfunction. The lack of subtype-specific vulnerability in excitatory neurons contrasts with the marked loss of certain inhibitory neuron subtypes, highlighting the need to understand cell-type-specific mechanisms of degeneration and resilience. Future work should explore the functional consequences of the conserved molecular changes in excitatory neurons, their relationship to synaptic and cognitive deficits, and whether similar programs operate in other brain regions or neurodegenerative diseases. The study’s findings align with, and extend, existing models of pan-neuronal stress responses in AD, but challenge the notion of major subtype-selective vulnerability among excitatory neurons in the aged human cortex.

Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on 1.3 million nuclei from 283 post-mortem samples across six brain regions (entorhinal cortex [EC], hippocampus [HC], anterior thalamus [TH], angular gyrus [AG], midtemporal cortex [MT], prefrontal cortex [PFC]) from 48 individuals (26 AD, 22 non-AD). High-resolution cell type annotation and region-specific analyses were conducted. Validation included in situ hybridization (RNAscope) and immunohistochemistry.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Regional Heterogeneity**
Excitatory neurons comprised 32.2% of all nuclei (436,014 cells), with marked regional differences: lowest in thalamus (14.4%), highest in neocortex (58.9%). These differences were consistent across individuals and not driven by AD status.

**Excitatory Neuron Subtype Identification & Characterization**
A total of 32 excitatory neuron subtypes were identified, with strong region-specificity:
- **Hippocampus (HC):** 7 subtypes, including CA1, CA2/3, dentate gyrus, subiculum.
- **Entorhinal Cortex (EC):** 9 subtypes, including L2 RELN+GPC5+, L2 TOX3+POSTN+, L3 RELN+, L5 RORB+GPC5+, L2/3 TOX3+TTC6+.
- **Thalamus (TH):** 2 subtypes, most notably NXPH1+RNF220+ (74% of TH excitatory neurons), not observed in neocortex, defined by NXPH1, RNF220, VAT1L, ERBB4, SV2C, LINC02137, regulated by LHX9, SOX2, SHOX2, TCF7L2. <keyFinding priority='1'>This TH-specific subtype is a major regional distinction and is validated by cross-species data and in situ hybridization.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **Neocortex (AG, MT, PFC):** 12 subtypes, largely shared across regions, defined by canonical markers (e.g., RORB, CUX2, LINC02306, etc.).

**Subtype Markers and Functional Signatures**
- **EC subtypes:** RELN, TOX3, GPC5, POSTN, TTC6, INO80D, COL5A2, etc. EC L2 and L3 subtypes are especially marked by RELN and TOX3.
- **TH NXPH1+RNF220+:** Intermediate glutamatergic/GABAergic signature, suggesting less polarized neurotransmitter identity compared to cortical subtypes. <keyFinding priority='2'>This intermediate state is supported by module scoring and cross-region comparisons.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Disease-Associated Subtype Vulnerability**
- **Vulnerable Subtypes:** Five excitatory neuron subtypes were significantly depleted in AD:
    - HC CA1 pyramidal neurons
    - EC L2 RELN+ (lateral EC), L3 RELN+, L5 RORB+GPC5+, L2/3 TOX3+TTC6+
  These subtypes showed odds ratios (OR) for depletion in AD of 0.38–0.66. <keyFinding priority='1'>Depletion was validated by in situ hybridization for RELN in human EC and by immunohistochemistry in App-KI and Tau(P301S) mouse models.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **Markers of Vulnerability:** Vulnerable subtypes had higher baseline expression of RELN, DAB1 (Reelin pathway), MAP2K5, PRKCA, SPHKAP, and heparan sulfate biosynthesis genes (HS6ST3, XYLT1, NDST3). <keyFinding priority='2'>RELN and DAB1 expression was highly specific to these subtypes, suggesting a mechanistic link to vulnerability.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **Functional Pathways:** Vulnerable subtypes were enriched for mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and Reelin signaling, while non-vulnerable subtypes were enriched for ubiquitin-ligase binding, chaperones, ER protein processing, and glycolysis.

**Disease Progression and Connectivity**
- Vulnerable subtypes were co-depleted in individuals with AD, especially in anatomically connected regions (e.g., EC L5 and subiculum, EC L2/3 and CA1), suggesting coordinated vulnerability along known projection pathways. <keyFinding priority='2'>This supports a model of network-based vulnerability in AD.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- Depletion of these subtypes correlated with worse cognitive performance, especially in episodic memory.

**Modulators & Metrics**
- No strong evidence for modulation by sex, age, or APOE genotype in the vulnerability of excitatory subtypes was reported in this study.
- Quantitative depletion was most pronounced in early-affected regions (EC, HC), consistent with Braak staging.

**Gene Regulatory Networks**
- SCENIC analysis identified LHX9, SOX2, SHOX2, TCF7L2 as regulators of the TH NXPH1+RNF220+ subtype.
- RELN pathway genes (RELN, DAB1) were highlighted as key regulators of vulnerability.

**Cell-Cell Communication**
- In the thalamus, NXPH1–NRXN1/3 ligand-receptor interactions were specific to excitatory neurons, while in cortex, NXPH1 was expressed in inhibitory neurons, indicating region-specific signaling swaps.

**Spatial Analysis**
- In situ hybridization validated the regional and subtype specificity of key markers (e.g., FOXP2, MEIS2 in TH; RELN in EC).

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**
- Vulnerable subtypes are depleted early in AD (EC, HC), with later involvement of neocortical subtypes, mirroring Braak progression.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**
- Some vulnerable subtypes express higher levels of AD GWAS genes (e.g., RELN, DAB1), but region-specific genetic drivers were not a major focus for excitatory neurons in this study.
</findings>

<clinical>
Excitatory neuron subtypes, especially in the EC and HC, are selectively vulnerable in AD, with depletion strongly associated with cognitive decline and early Braak stages. The RELN-DAB1 pathway and mitochondrial function are implicated in this vulnerability, suggesting potential targets for intervention. The coordinated loss of connected subtypes supports a network-based model of disease spread. These findings reinforce the importance of preserving specific excitatory neuron populations for cognitive resilience and highlight RELN+ subtypes as candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. <keyFinding priority='1'>RELN+ excitatory neurons in EC are validated as a key vulnerable population in both human and mouse AD models.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This study identifies 32 excitatory neuron subtypes across six brain regions, with strong regional specialization. Five subtypes—especially EC L2 RELN+, L3 RELN+, L5 RORB+GPC5+, L2/3 TOX3+TTC6+, and HC CA1—are selectively depleted in Alzheimer’s disease, correlating with cognitive decline and early Braak stages. Vulnerability is linked to high baseline expression of RELN and DAB1 (Reelin pathway), and mitochondrial genes. The thalamic NXPH1+RNF220+ subtype is a major regional distinction. RELN+ excitatory neuron loss is validated in both human and mouse AD models, highlighting RELN as a key marker of vulnerability.

---

**Research Implications (≈150 words)**

This work provides a comprehensive atlas of excitatory neuron diversity and vulnerability in the aged human brain, revealing that selective loss of RELN+ and other region-specific subtypes underlies early cognitive decline in AD. The strong association of RELN and DAB1 expression with vulnerability aligns with prior reports of Reelin pathway involvement in AD, and the coordinated depletion of connected subtypes supports models of network-based disease propagation. The identification of a thalamus-specific NXPH1+RNF220+ excitatory neuron subtype expands our understanding of regional specialization. The findings are consistent with, and extend, previous single-cell studies that identified EC L2 RELN+ and CA1 neurons as early targets in AD, but provide new evidence for coordinated vulnerability across projection pathways. Open questions remain regarding the precise mechanisms by which RELN signaling confers vulnerability, and whether modulation of this pathway could promote resilience. Future studies should explore the interplay of genetic risk, aging, and cell-intrinsic factors in excitatory neuron degeneration.

Disease focus: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC, Brodmann area 9) tissue from 71 human donors (37 MDD cases, 34 controls; both sexes). Over 160,000 nuclei were analyzed, with clustering and annotation yielding 41 clusters across 7 major cell types, including 20 excitatory neuron clusters. Data integration and batch correction were performed using Harmony; cell type annotation was based on canonical markers and spatial transcriptomics label transfer. Differential expression was assessed using pseudobulk approaches, with validation via permutation, gene set enrichment, and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA).
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Excitatory neurons comprised the largest cell population (48% of nuclei). In MDD, there was a significant increase in the proportion of excitatory neuron nuclei compared to controls (FDR = 0.0477), while astrocytes and OPCs were decreased. This pattern was consistent across sexes.

**Excitatory Neuron Subtypes:**  
Twenty excitatory neuron clusters were identified, annotated by cortical layer markers (e.g., ExN10_L46 for deep layers 4–6, ExN1_L24 for superficial layers 2–4). The most disease-relevant subtype was ExN10_L46 (deep layer excitatory neurons).

- **ExN10_L46 (Deep Layer Excitatory Neurons):**  
  In males, ExN10_L46 showed the strongest MDD association, with 238/447 (53%) of all male cluster-level DEGs. These genes were predominantly downregulated in MDD (80% of male cluster DEGs), including synaptic and neuronal function genes. The meta-analysis (combining both sexes) further highlighted ExN10_L46, with 254 DEGs, again mostly downregulated.  
  <keyFinding priority='1'>ExN10_L46 is the principal excitatory neuron subtype implicated in male MDD, with broad downregulation of synaptic/neuronal genes.</keyFinding>
  <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
  <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

- **Other Excitatory Subtypes:**  
  Several other deep and superficial layer clusters (e.g., ExN12_L56, ExN13_L56, ExN4_L35) showed moderate numbers of DEGs, but none approached the magnitude seen in ExN10_L46. Some clusters (ExN4_L35, ExN7, ExN12_L56, ExN13_L56) displayed discordant MDD-associated gene expression patterns between sexes, as revealed by RRHO2 analysis.  
  <keyFinding priority='2'>A subset of excitatory neuron clusters exhibit sex-discordant transcriptomic responses to MDD, especially in deep layers.</keyFinding>
  <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>
  <contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>
  The authors note that while overall patterns are concordant, specific clusters (notably deep-layer excitatory neurons) show sex-specific or even opposite changes.

- **Homeostatic vs. Disease-Associated States:**  
  The study did not identify discrete "disease-associated" excitatory neuron states analogous to microglial DAM/PAM, but rather observed broad, cluster-specific downregulation of neuronal/synaptic genes in MDD, especially in males.

**Differential Gene Expression & Pathways:**  
- In males, excitatory neuron DEGs were enriched for synaptic, neuronal signaling, and neurotransmitter-related pathways, with a strong bias toward downregulation.
- In females, excitatory neuron clusters showed far fewer DEGs, and these did not cluster in a single subtype.
- Pathway analysis (GSEA, WGCNA) in ExN10_L46 and related clusters highlighted loss of neuronal function, but no strong evidence for inflammatory or stress-response signatures in excitatory neurons.

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
- Sex was a major modulator: deep layer excitatory neuron transcriptomic changes were prominent in males but not females.
- No significant associations with age, pH, or PMI were reported for excitatory neuron findings.
- No direct genetic (GWAS) or eQTL integration was performed for excitatory neuron subtypes.

**Cell-Cell Communication & Spatial Analysis:**  
- No spatial or morphological validation specific to excitatory neuron subtypes was reported.
- No major ligand-receptor or cell-cell communication findings centered on excitatory neurons.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
- No explicit pseudotime or trajectory modeling was performed for excitatory neurons; the focus was on cross-sectional case-control differences.

**Contradictions/Departures:**  
- The authors explicitly note that, while previous bulk and single-nucleus studies have implicated excitatory neurons in MDD, their data show a strong sex bias: deep layer excitatory neuron dysregulation is a male-specific phenomenon, with microglia and interneurons more prominent in females.
- RRHO2 analysis revealed that, although threshold-free gene expression patterns are moderately concordant between sexes, the specific DEGs and implicated clusters diverge, especially for excitatory neurons and OPCs.
<contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>
The authors discuss that their findings contrast with prior bulk tissue studies reporting similar transcriptomic changes in both sexes, highlighting the value of cell-type resolution.
</findings>

<clinical>
Excitatory neurons, particularly deep layer subtypes (ExN10_L46), are strongly implicated in the molecular pathology of MDD in males, with broad downregulation of synaptic and neuronal function genes. This suggests that impaired excitatory neurotransmission and cortical circuit dysfunction may underlie depressive symptoms in men. In contrast, these changes are not prominent in females, indicating sex-specific molecular mechanisms. The findings raise the possibility that therapeutic strategies targeting excitatory neuron function may be more relevant for male MDD, while other cell types (e.g., microglia, interneurons) may be more critical in females. However, these associations are cross-sectional and do not establish causality.
</clinical>

---

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**  
The study identifies deep layer excitatory neurons (ExN10_L46) as the principal excitatory neuron subtype affected in MDD, with strong downregulation of synaptic and neuronal genes—an effect that is male-specific. In contrast, females show minimal excitatory neuron transcriptomic changes, implicating other cell types (microglia, interneurons) instead. These findings highlight a sex-dependent divergence in the cellular pathology of depression, with ExN10_L46 dysregulation being a key feature in males.

---

**Research Implications (≈150 words):**  
This work underscores the importance of deep layer excitatory neuron dysfunction in the male prefrontal cortex in MDD, suggesting that future research should focus on the mechanisms driving synaptic and neuronal gene downregulation in ExN10_L46 and related subtypes. The lack of similar findings in females, despite overall concordant gene expression trends, points to fundamental sex differences in depression pathophysiology. Open questions include whether these transcriptomic changes reflect cell-intrinsic vulnerability, circuit-level alterations, or secondary effects of glial or interneuron dysfunction. The absence of discrete "disease-associated" excitatory neuron states (as seen in microglia) suggests a more diffuse or subtype-specific response. The findings align with, but also refine, previous models by demonstrating that excitatory neuron involvement in MDD is not uniform across sexes. Future studies should integrate spatial, functional, and genetic data to clarify the causal role of excitatory neuron subtypes and their potential as therapeutic targets, particularly in male depression.

Excitatory neurons (EX) were the most abundant cell type in the snRNA-seq dataset (n=229,041/585,042 nuclei). No major overall loss of excitatory neurons was reported across disease groups, but there was evidence for selective vulnerability and region-specific transcriptomic changes, particularly in cortical layer 3/4 (L3/L4) and upper layers.

**Differential Gene Expression:**  
Excitatory neurons showed substantial downregulation of genes in L3/L4 across all AD subtypes (sporadic, DSAD), with the effect most pronounced in late-stage AD and DSAD. This downregulation was not observed for APP itself in spatial cluster L3/L4, despite its upregulation in DSAD overall.  
Key downregulated genes in L3/L4 included those involved in synaptic function, neurotransmission, and amyloid fibril formation (e.g., RBFOX1, GRIN1, TCF4, NEAT1).  
Upregulated genes in excitatory neurons (especially in L1) included APP, SCN2A, and CPE, particularly in DSAD and late-stage AD.

**Pathway Enrichment:**  
Downregulated pathways in L3/L4 and L3–L5 included amyloid fibril formation, synaptic vesicle exocytosis, neurotransmitter transport, and long-term potentiation.  
Upregulated pathways in L1 included APP metabolism, macroautophagy, and RNA splicing, suggesting altered neuronal homeostasis and processing in upper layers.

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
Excitatory neurons were further stratified by cortical layer identity using spatial transcriptomics and snRNA-seq integration:
- **EX L2, EX L2/L3, EX L3–L5, EX L5/L6, EX L6:** These subtypes were defined by canonical layer marker genes (e.g., RELN for L1/L2, CARTPT for L2/3, RORB for L3/4, MBP for L6b).
- **L3/L4 excitatory neurons:** Showed the strongest disease-associated downregulation, with loss of synaptic and neurotransmission genes. This was consistent across sporadic AD and DSAD, and correlated with regions of preferential amyloid pathology.
- **L1 excitatory neurons:** Displayed upregulation of APP and related metabolic genes in all disease groups, despite being less densely populated with neurons.
- **Other subtypes (L5/L6, L6b):** Showed less pronounced or more variable changes, with some upregulation of late-stage AD modules in L6b.

**Spatial and Morphological Validation:**  
Spatial transcriptomics confirmed that transcriptomic changes in excitatory neurons were regionally restricted, with L3/L4 and upper layers most affected. Amyloid imaging and hotspot analysis showed that these regions also had preferential amyloid deposition, supporting the link between transcriptomic vulnerability and pathology.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
Temporal modeling in 5xFAD mice showed that amyloid-associated gene expression changes in excitatory neurons increased with age, particularly in deep and upper cortical layers, mirroring human findings.

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
Sex differences were observed: male DEGs in excitatory neurons were enriched for alternative splicing, chromatin organization, and cytoskeletal processes, while female DEGs were more glial/vascular. No major genotype (APOE) effects on excitatory neuron subtypes were highlighted.

**Gene Regulatory Networks:**  
Co-expression network analysis identified meta-module M6 (APP, SCN2A, CPE) as upregulated in L1 excitatory neurons across all diagnoses, and M3/M4/M7/M10/M13 as enriched for chemical synaptic transmission and glutamate signaling, downregulated in L3/L4 and L3–L5.

**Cell-Cell Communication:**  
Excitatory neuron signaling via NECTIN (synapse maintenance) was downregulated in DSAD, with reduced NECTIN2 expression validated by immunofluorescence. This suggests impaired excitatory neuron connectivity in disease.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
Some hub genes in excitatory neuron modules (APP, SCN2A) are established AD GWAS loci. However, AD genetic risk enrichment was strongest in glial clusters, not excitatory neurons.

<clinical>
Excitatory neurons, especially those in L3/L4, are selectively vulnerable in both sporadic and DSAD forms of Alzheimer’s disease, showing early and pronounced downregulation of synaptic and neurotransmission genes. This molecular signature aligns with regions of preferential amyloid deposition and may underlie cognitive deficits. The upregulation of APP and related genes in L1 neurons suggests altered processing in upper layers, but the functional consequences remain unclear. Loss of NECTIN signaling in excitatory neurons may impair synaptic maintenance. While these findings are strongly associated with disease status and pathology, causality cannot be established due to the cross-sectional design. Excitatory neuron subtypes and their marker genes may serve as spatially resolved biomarkers of disease progression or targets for interventions aimed at synaptic preservation.

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**  
The study reveals that excitatory neurons, particularly those in cortical layer 3/4 (L3/L4), exhibit pronounced downregulation of synaptic and neurotransmission genes in both sporadic and Down syndrome-associated Alzheimer’s disease (DSAD), coinciding with regions of preferential amyloid pathology. Upregulation of APP and related metabolic genes is observed in L1 excitatory neurons across all AD subtypes. NECTIN-mediated synaptic signaling is diminished in DSAD. These findings highlight a spatially and subtype-specific vulnerability of excitatory neurons, with L3/L4 changes most strongly associated with disease status and pathology, independent of major genetic or demographic modifiers.

---

**Research Implications (≈200 words):**  
This study provides a high-resolution, spatially resolved map of excitatory neuron vulnerability in Alzheimer’s disease, emphasizing the selective downregulation of synaptic and neurotransmission genes in L3/L4 neurons as a convergent feature of both sporadic and DSAD forms. The alignment of transcriptomic changes with regions of amyloid deposition supports the hypothesis that excitatory neuron dysfunction in these layers is central to cognitive decline. The identification of distinct excitatory neuron subtypes by layer, and their differential responses to disease, refines existing classification schemes and suggests that future research should focus on the mechanisms driving L3/L4 vulnerability—such as local circuit properties, connectivity, or metabolic demands. The observed upregulation of APP and metabolic genes in L1 neurons, and the loss of NECTIN signaling, raise questions about compensatory versus pathogenic processes in upper layers. While the study integrates spatial, single-nucleus, and proteomic data, it remains cross-sectional; longitudinal and functional studies are needed to determine causality and reversibility. No explicit contradictions with prior models are discussed, but the strong spatial restriction of vulnerability to L3/L4 provides a more nuanced view than bulk tissue analyses. Open questions include the triggers for L3/L4 excitatory neuron dysfunction, the interplay with glial pathology, and the potential for targeted interventions to preserve synaptic integrity in these regions.

Disease focus: Late-stage Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
</metadata>

<methods>
This study performed both single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) and single-nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) on postmortem human prefrontal cortex (PFC) tissue from late-stage AD patients and age-matched controls. Integration of transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility data was achieved using Seurat and mutual nearest neighbor (MNN) batch correction. Cell-type and subpopulation identities were validated by canonical marker gene expression and chromatin accessibility, with additional spatial validation by in situ hybridization and immunostaining for select targets.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Identification**  
Excitatory neurons (EX) were robustly identified in both snRNA-seq (EX1–5) and snATAC-seq (EX.a–e) datasets, comprising a substantial fraction of the total nuclei (snRNA-seq: 6,369 nuclei; snATAC-seq: 24,076 nuclei). Subtypes were annotated based on layer-specific and canonical marker genes, such as LINC00507 for L2–3 excitatory neurons (EX1), SATB2, SLC17A7, and others. The study did not report a significant overall loss or gain in the proportion of excitatory neuron subtypes between late-stage AD and controls, in contrast to the pronounced changes observed in glial populations. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>  

**Excitatory Neuron Subtypes and Markers**  
- **EX1 (L2–3 excitatory neurons):** Defined by high expression of LINC00507, SATB2, and SLC17A7. This subtype corresponds to upper-layer cortical neurons.  
- **EX2–EX5:** Additional subtypes were distinguished by combinatorial expression of canonical markers, but the paper does not provide detailed marker lists for each.  
- **snATAC-seq clusters (EX.a–e):** Mapped to snRNA-seq subtypes via label transfer, confirming correspondence between chromatin and transcriptomic states.

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**  
The study found that, while many differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in excitatory neurons matched prior literature, there were no major, disease-specific, cluster-wide transcriptional signatures or dramatic shifts in excitatory neuron subtypes in late-stage AD. The DEGs identified were largely consistent with known neuronal markers, and no novel, disease-specific excitatory neuron states were described. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>  

**Chromatin Accessibility and Regulatory Features**  
Chromatin accessibility at excitatory neuron marker gene promoters (e.g., SLC17A7, SATB2) was used to validate subtype identity. The study did not report major AD-associated changes in chromatin accessibility or cis-regulatory element (cCRE) usage specific to excitatory neuron subtypes. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>  

**Transcription Factor Motif Analysis**  
TF motif enrichment analysis revealed increased enrichment of certain motifs in excitatory neurons in AD, but the study does not highlight any specific TFs or regulatory modules as being uniquely dysregulated in excitatory neuron subtypes. There was an observation of oligodendrocyte-related TF motif enrichment in excitatory neurons, but the functional significance was not explored in detail. <keyFinding priority='3'><confidenceLevel>low</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>  

**Gene Regulatory Networks and Cell-Cell Communication**  
No major excitatory neuron-specific gene regulatory networks or ligand-receptor interactions were highlighted as altered in AD. The focus of network and trajectory analyses was on glial populations.

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**  
Spatial validation (RNAscope, immunostaining) was performed for select glial and oligodendrocyte markers, but not for excitatory neuron subtypes.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**  
Trajectory and pseudotime analyses were not specifically applied to excitatory neuron subtypes. The main trajectory analyses focused on glial cell maturation and activation states.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**  
Integration of AD GWAS loci with chromatin accessibility data did not highlight excitatory neurons as a major cell type mediating genetic risk. Heritability enrichment for AD risk variants was not significant in excitatory neuron clusters, in contrast to microglia and oligodendrocytes.

**Summary of Negative Findings**  
Overall, the study reports minimal disease-associated changes in excitatory neuron subtypes, gene expression, or chromatin accessibility in late-stage AD, especially compared to the pronounced alterations observed in glial populations. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>  
</findings>

<clinical>
Excitatory neurons in the human prefrontal cortex do not exhibit major disease-associated subtypes, transcriptional reprogramming, or chromatin accessibility changes in late-stage Alzheimer’s disease, according to this multi-omic single-nucleus study. This suggests that, at least in advanced disease, excitatory neuron molecular heterogeneity is relatively preserved, and that the most prominent regulatory and cellular changes occur in glial populations. The lack of strong excitatory neuron-specific signatures in late-stage AD may reflect either selective vulnerability at earlier stages or a relative resistance of these subtypes to late-stage disease processes. No direct therapeutic or biomarker implications for excitatory neuron subtypes are proposed in this study. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**  
This multi-omic single-nucleus study of late-stage Alzheimer’s disease (Morabito et al., Nature Genetics 2021) found that excitatory neuron subtypes in the human prefrontal cortex, defined by canonical markers such as LINC00507 and SATB2, show minimal disease-associated changes in proportion, gene expression, or chromatin accessibility. No novel AD-specific excitatory neuron states were identified, and genetic risk enrichment was not observed in these populations. The most pronounced molecular and regulatory alterations were instead found in glial cell types.

---

**Research Implications (≈150 words):**  
The findings indicate that, in late-stage AD, excitatory neuron subtypes maintain their molecular identity and do not undergo major disease-associated transcriptional or epigenetic reprogramming, in contrast to glial populations. This raises important questions about the timing and nature of excitatory neuron vulnerability in AD: are disease-associated changes present at earlier stages, or are these neurons selectively lost before late-stage disease, leaving a relatively unaffected population? The absence of strong excitatory neuron signatures in late-stage AD aligns with some prior single-nucleus studies, but contrasts with models proposing prominent neuronal reprogramming. The study’s results suggest that future work should focus on earlier disease stages, spatial context, or vulnerable subpopulations not captured here. The marker genes and subtypes identified are consistent with established cortical neuron classification schemes. No explicit contradictions with prior data are discussed by the authors. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

<keyFinding priority='1'>The most pronounced transcriptomic dysregulation in MDD was observed in the deep-layer excitatory neuron cluster Ex7, which, together with OPC2 (immature oligodendrocyte precursor cells), accounted for nearly half (47%) of all differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across the dataset.</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>

**Excitatory Neuron Subtype Characterization**  
- **Ex7 (Deep Layer V/VI Excitatory Neurons):**  
  - **Defining markers:** DPP10 (primary), TOX, RXFP1, FOXP2, TLE4, SLC17A7, PCP4, HTR2C.
  - **Functional signature:** Associated with neuron projection maintenance, synaptic plasticity, and cytoskeletal regulation.
  - **Disease association:** Ex7 showed the highest number of DEGs among excitatory clusters (19 DEGs, mostly downregulated), including genes linked to MDD in GWAS (e.g., FADS2, CKB, KAZN).
  - **Key DEGs:** Downregulation of PRKAR1B, TUBB4B, FIBP, FKBP4, SYN1, and others; upregulation of KIF16B and KAZN.
  - **Pathways:** Enrichment for neurotransmitter secretion, regulation of synaptic plasticity, cytoskeletal function, and HSP90 chaperone cycle for steroid hormone receptors (SHR).
  - **Validation:** Decreased FIBP expression in Ex7 neurons confirmed by RNAScope.
  - **Cell-cell communication:** Altered FGF signaling (e.g., FGF14, FGF20, FIBP) between Ex7 and OPC2, with predicted changes in ligand-receptor interactions.

- **Other Excitatory Subtypes:**  
  - **Ex2:** Also showed downregulation of PRKAR1B.
  - **Ex6:** Downregulation of TUBB4B.
  - **Ex10 (Superficial layers):** Fewer DEGs, less affected in MDD.
  - **General pattern:** Most excitatory clusters with DEGs showed predominantly downregulation in MDD.

**Modulators & Metrics**  
- All subjects were male; no sex effects could be assessed.
- No significant differences in cell-type proportions between cases and controls were reported for excitatory neuron clusters.
- No explicit genotype (e.g., GWAS risk allele) stratification, but several DEGs overlap with MDD risk loci.

**Gene Regulatory Networks**  
- Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) identified a "blue module" highly associated with both MDD and Ex7, enriched for genes involved in synaptic function and plasticity.
- Several hub genes in this module overlapped with Ex7 DEGs.

**Cell-Cell Communication**  
- Predictive ligand-receptor analysis (CCInx) revealed altered FGF signaling between Ex7 and OPC2, suggesting disrupted neuron-glia crosstalk in MDD.

**Spatial Analysis**  
- RNAScope in situ hybridization validated decreased FIBP in deep-layer excitatory neurons (Ex7) and increased KAZN in OPC2.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**  
- No explicit pseudotime or trajectory analysis for excitatory neurons; such analysis was performed for oligodendrocyte lineage.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**  
- Several Ex7 DEGs (FADS2, CKB, KAZN) overlap with MDD GWAS loci and curated depression gene databases (PsyGeNET, DisGeNET).

</findings>

<clinical>
The study implicates deep-layer excitatory neurons, particularly the Ex7 subtype, as a major locus of transcriptional dysregulation in MDD. Downregulation of genes involved in synaptic plasticity, cytoskeletal maintenance, and stress hormone receptor cycling suggests impaired neuronal connectivity and adaptability in MDD. The altered FGF signaling and neuron-glia communication between Ex7 and OPC2 may contribute to disease mechanisms, potentially affecting cortical circuitry and plasticity. These findings highlight deep-layer excitatory neurons as potential targets for therapeutic intervention or biomarker development, though causality remains to be established.
</clinical>

---

**Quick Reference**

Deep-layer excitatory neurons (notably the Ex7 subtype, marked by DPP10, TOX, RXFP1, FOXP2, TLE4, SLC17A7) show the strongest transcriptomic dysregulation in MDD, with widespread downregulation of genes involved in synaptic plasticity and cytoskeletal function. Ex7, together with immature OPCs, accounts for nearly half of all cell-type-specific gene expression changes, and several Ex7 DEGs overlap with MDD risk loci. Altered FGF signaling between Ex7 and OPC2 is a key predicted disease mechanism.

---

**Research Implications**

This study provides strong evidence that deep-layer excitatory neurons, especially the Ex7 subtype, are central to the molecular pathology of MDD in the prefrontal cortex. The convergence of downregulated synaptic and cytoskeletal genes, overlap with MDD GWAS loci, and predicted disruption of FGF-mediated neuron-glia signaling suggest that Ex7 neurons may be critical for disease onset or progression. Open questions include whether these transcriptional changes are causal or consequential, how they relate to symptom domains, and whether similar patterns are seen in females or other brain regions. The Ex7 subtype’s marker profile aligns with known deep-layer projection neuron signatures, but the study’s integration of cell-cell communication and validation by in situ hybridization strengthens the case for their disease relevance. No explicit contradictions with prior models are discussed, but the focus on deep-layer excitatory neurons and their crosstalk with OPCs represents a shift from traditional monoaminergic or glial-centric hypotheses. Future work should address sex differences, longitudinal changes, and functional consequences of these molecular alterations.

Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with emphasis on tau pathology (neurofibrillary tangles, NFTs) in human prefrontal cortex (BA9).
</metadata>

<methods>
This study developed a FACS-based method to isolate and profile single neuronal somas with and without NFTs from fresh-frozen human prefrontal cortex (BA9) of Braak VI AD patients and age-matched controls. Over 120,000 single-cell transcriptomes were generated (63,110 from AD, 57,534 from controls), using 10x Genomics single-cell RNA-seq. Immunostaining for MAP2 (neuronal marker) and AT8 (phospho-tau) enabled separation of NFT-bearing (AT8+) and NFT-free (AT8–) neurons. Subtype identities and spatial validation were confirmed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Susceptibility**
Excitatory neurons were the principal focus, with 13 subtypes identified in BA9, spanning layers 2–6. NFTs were present in 6.3% ± 1.15% of all neurons, but their distribution was highly subtype-specific. The most NFT-susceptible excitatory subtypes were:
- **Ex1 (layers 2–3, CUX2/LAMP5+)**: 11.7% NFT+.
- **Ex2 (layers 2–4, CUX2/COL5A2+)**: 10.5% NFT+.
- **Ex7 (layer 5, RORB/PCP4+)**: 10.6% NFT+.
- **Ex8 (layer 5b, PCP4/ROBO3+)**: 5.7% NFT+.
- **Ex11 (layer 6b, THEMIS/NR4A2/NTNG2+)**: 5.6% NFT+ (intermediate).
Other excitatory subtypes (e.g., Ex4/5 RORB/GABGR1+, Ex6 RORB/RPRM+) were less susceptible (3.6–5.2%), and deep layer 6 subtypes were largely spared. Inhibitory neurons were generally resistant, except for chandelier cells (In2, 6.8% NFT+).

<keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
NFT susceptibility is highly subtype-specific among excitatory neurons, with superficial (layers 2–3) and specific layer 5 subtypes (RORB/PCP4+) being most vulnerable. This was validated by both transcriptomics and histology.
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</keyFinding>

**Subtype Characterization**
- **Ex1 (CUX2/LAMP5+)**: Superficial layers 2–3, high NFT burden, defined by CUX2 and LAMP5 expression.
- **Ex2 (CUX2/COL5A2+)**: Deeper layers 2–4, high NFT burden, defined by CUX2 and COL5A2.
- **Ex7 (RORB/PCP4+)**: Layer 5, high NFT burden, defined by RORB and PCP4.
- **Ex8 (PCP4/ROBO3+)**: Layer 5b, moderate NFT burden, defined by PCP4 and ROBO3.
- **Ex11 (THEMIS/NR4A2/NTNG2+)**: Layer 6b, intermediate NFT burden, defined by THEMIS, NR4A2, NTNG2.

**Molecular Signatures of NFT-Bearing Excitatory Neurons**
NFT-bearing excitatory neurons showed a robust and largely shared upregulation of synaptic transmission genes, especially those involved in the synaptic vesicle cycle. A core set of 63 synaptic genes was upregulated across subtypes, including:
- **NEFL, SNAP25, SYT1** (biomarkers of neurodegeneration)
- **GRIN2B, GRIN2A** (NMDA receptor subunits)
- **ATP1B1, ATP1A3** (Na+/K+ ATPase subunits)
- **NTRK2, NRXN3, BSN, SV2B, STY4, STY11**
- **APP, PRNP** (upregulated in most subtypes except Ex3)

<keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
NFT-bearing excitatory neurons share a marked upregulation of synaptic vesicle cycling and transmission genes, including established AD biomarkers and risk genes. This signature is robust across the most NFT-susceptible subtypes.
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</keyFinding>

**Subtype-Specific and Shared Pathways**
- Synaptic transmission, calcium homeostasis, microtubule dynamics, and axonal remodeling were commonly upregulated in NFT+ neurons.
- Glucose metabolism and oxidative phosphorylation changes were subtype-specific, especially prominent in Ex3 (RORB/PLCH1/GAL+), which showed downregulation of these pathways.
- Apoptosis and cell death pathways were only modestly enriched, with both pro- and anti-apoptotic regulators present.

<keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>
NFT-bearing neurons show cell-type-specific metabolic and mitochondrial pathway changes, with Ex3 displaying unique downregulation of oxidative phosphorylation and distinct transcriptional regulatory networks (e.g., GABPA).
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</keyFinding>

**Gene Regulatory Networks**
REST (a regulator of neuronal differentiation and excitability) was implicated across subtypes, while GABPA was specific to Ex3.

**Cell-Cell Communication and Spatial Validation**
No major findings on ligand-receptor crosstalk were highlighted for excitatory neurons. Spatial and morphological validation of subtype markers and NFT distribution was performed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**
NFT formation and neuronal death were largely uncoupled: subtypes most susceptible to NFTs were not more likely to be lost in late-stage AD, suggesting NFTs may represent a stress response rather than a direct cause of cell death.

<keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
NFT susceptibility and neuronal death are uncoupled in BA9: highly NFT-prone excitatory subtypes are not preferentially lost in late-stage AD, as shown by both this and independent snRNA-seq datasets.
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</keyFinding>

**Genetic Modulators**
Some upregulated synaptic genes in NFT+ neurons are AD risk factors (e.g., GRIN2B, NRXN3, CTNND2, PTK2B, SHANK2, NRGN, SYNGAP1, SYNJ1), but no direct genotype-stratified analysis was performed.

</findings>

<clinical>
Excitatory neuron subtypes in superficial and layer 5 cortex are the principal cellular substrates for NFT formation in AD, with a shared molecular response centered on synaptic vesicle cycling and stress pathways. These changes may reflect a homeostatic or compensatory response to synaptic dysfunction rather than a direct driver of neuronal death. The upregulation of established AD biomarkers (NEFL, SNAP25, SYT1) in NFT+ neurons highlights their potential as cell-type-specific markers for disease progression or therapeutic targeting. The uncoupling of NFT formation from cell loss suggests that NFTs alone are insufficient to explain neurodegeneration in BA9, and that additional factors (e.g., microenvironmental stress, inflammation) may be required for neuronal death.
</clinical>

**Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This study reveals that NFT susceptibility among excitatory neurons in human AD prefrontal cortex is highly subtype-specific, with superficial (CUX2+) and layer 5 (RORB/PCP4+) subtypes most vulnerable. NFT-bearing excitatory neurons share a robust upregulation of synaptic vesicle cycling genes—including NEFL, SNAP25, and SYT1—and several AD risk genes. Notably, NFT formation and neuronal death are uncoupled: NFT-prone subtypes are not preferentially lost in late-stage AD. These findings suggest NFTs reflect a cell-type-specific stress response, not direct neurotoxicity, and highlight synaptic gene upregulation as a potential biomarker signature.

---

**Research Implications (≈150 words)**

This work provides a high-resolution census of excitatory neuron subtype vulnerability to tau pathology in human AD cortex, revealing that NFT formation is highly selective and not synonymous with neuronal loss. The identification of a core synaptic vesicle cycling gene signature in NFT-bearing neurons—encompassing both established AD biomarkers and risk genes—offers a valuable resource for biomarker discovery and mechanistic studies. The uncoupling of NFT formation from cell death challenges the classical view of NFTs as direct drivers of neurodegeneration, instead supporting a model where NFTs represent a stress or compensatory response to synaptic dysfunction. Open questions include the temporal dynamics of NFT formation versus cell loss, the role of microenvironmental factors in determining neuronal fate, and whether similar subtype-specific patterns exist in other brain regions or tauopathies. The molecular signatures described here largely align with prior models of synaptic dysfunction in AD, but the explicit demonstration of NFT–cell death dissociation is a significant advance.

# summary for Pfisterer 2020 (excitatory neurons)

1) **Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This study used single-nucleus RNA-seq of human temporal cortex to reveal that excitatory neuron subtypes—especially L5–6_Fezf2_Tle4_Abo, L2–3_Cux2_Frem3, and L2_Cux2_Lamp5—undergo the most pronounced transcriptomic changes in temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). These subtypes show strong upregulation of AMPA receptor auxiliary subunits (notably CKAMP44/SHISA9), layer-specific dysregulation of glutamate receptor genes (e.g., GRIA1, GRIN3A), and enrichment for epilepsy-associated genes. The most affected excitatory subtypes are spatially and transcriptionally coordinated, suggesting circuit-level vulnerability, with changes validated by in situ hybridization. Age and sex had minimal impact on these findings.

**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Identification**  
Excitatory neurons (principal neurons) were classified into 13 transcriptomic subtypes, primarily defined by laminar markers:  
- L2–3_Cux2_Frem3  
- L2_Cux2_Lamp5  
- L3_Cux2_Prss12  
- L4_Rorb_Mme, L4_Rorb_Met, L4_Rorb_Arhgap15  
- L5–6_Fezf2_Lrrk1_Pcp4, L5–6_Fezf2_Lrrk1_Sema3e  
- L5–6_Fezf2_Tle4_Abo, L5–6_Fezf2_Tle4_Htr2c, L5–6_Fezf2_Tle4_Scube1  
- L5–6_Themis_Ntng2, L5–6_Themis_Sema3a

**Subtype-Specific Changes**  
The most pronounced epilepsy-related transcriptomic changes were observed in:  
- **L5–6_Fezf2_Tle4_Abo**:  
  - Markers: FEZF2, TLE4, SCUBE1, ABO  
  - Features: Strong upregulation of AMPA receptor auxiliary subunits (CKAMP44/SHISA9, CACNG3/TARP-γ3, CNIH3, GSG1L), upregulation of GRIA1, GRIN3A, GRIK4, GRM1, GRM7; downregulation of GRIA2, GRIN2A, GRM5.  
  - Functional signature: Hyperexcitability, synaptic reorganization, altered ion channel expression.  
  - Disease association: Largest transcriptomic divergence from controls, enrichment for epilepsy GWAS and curated risk genes.  
  - <keyFinding priority='1'>L5–6_Fezf2_Tle4_Abo is the most affected excitatory subtype, with strong upregulation of AMPA auxiliary subunits and glutamate receptors, suggesting a key role in epileptogenesis.</keyFinding>

- **L2–3_Cux2_Frem3 and L2_Cux2_Lamp5**:  
  - Markers: CUX2, FREM3, LAMP5  
  - Features: Upregulation of GRIA1, GRIA4, SHISA9, CNIH3, GRIK3; layer-specific changes in glutamate signaling genes.  
  - Functional signature: Synaptic reorganization, dendritic spine development, neuronal morphogenesis.  
  - Disease association: Significant reduction in cell numbers in epilepsy, strong enrichment for epilepsy-related DE genes and pathways.  
  - <keyFinding priority='1'>Upper-layer excitatory subtypes (L2–3_Cux2_Frem3, L2_Cux2_Lamp5) show coordinated transcriptomic shifts, including upregulation of AMPA receptor components and morphogenesis genes.</keyFinding>  
  - <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>  
  - <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

- **L3_Cux2_Prss12**:  
  - Markers: CUX2, PRSS12  
  - Features: Intermediate transcriptomic changes, co-clustering with other affected subtypes.  
  - <keyFinding priority='2'>L3_Cux2_Prss12 is moderately affected, sharing some transcriptomic shifts with the most vulnerable subtypes.</keyFinding>  
  - <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>  
  - <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**  
- **AMPA receptor auxiliary subunits** (CKAMP44/SHISA9, CACNG3, CNIH3, GSG1L) were upregulated in a layer- and subtype-specific manner, with CKAMP44 showing the most dramatic and widespread increase, validated by smFISH.  
- **Glutamate receptor subunits** (GRIA1, GRIN3A, GRIK3, GRIK4) were upregulated in affected subtypes, while GRIA2 and GRIN2A were downregulated in some.  
- **Pathways**: Enrichment for synaptic transmission, regulation of membrane potential, dendritic spine development, neuron projection morphogenesis, and glutamate signaling.  
- **Gene co-expression network analysis** identified modules upregulated in epilepsy, enriched for synaptic and ion channel genes, especially in L5–6_Fezf2_Tle4_Abo and L2–3_Cux2 subtypes.

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**  
- smFISH confirmed layer-specific upregulation of CKAMP44, GRIA1, and GRIN3A in epileptic cortex, matching snRNA-seq findings.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories and Modulators**  
- Age and sex had minimal impact on excitatory neuron transcriptomes in this dataset.  
- The most affected subtypes clustered together by GO term enrichment, suggesting coordinated circuit-level vulnerability.

**Cell-Cell Communication and Circuitry**  
- The most affected excitatory subtypes (L2–3_Cux2 and L5–6_Fezf2 families) co-clustered with specific interneuron subtypes (e.g., Sst_Tac1, Vip_Cbln1), indicating possible involvement in shared epileptogenic circuits.

<clinical>
The study demonstrates that specific excitatory neuron subtypes, particularly L5–6_Fezf2_Tle4_Abo and L2–3_Cux2_Frem3, are disproportionately affected in TLE, with transcriptomic changes that may underlie hyperexcitability and seizure generation. Upregulation of AMPA receptor auxiliary subunits and glutamate receptor genes in these subtypes suggests potential mechanisms for increased synaptic strength and excitability. These findings highlight candidate molecular targets (e.g., CKAMP44/SHISA9) for therapeutic intervention and suggest that circuit-level, subtype-specific vulnerability is a key feature of epileptogenesis in human cortex.  
<keyFinding priority='1'>The identification of subtype- and layer-specific molecular changes in excitatory neurons provides mechanistic insight into seizure generation and potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets for epilepsy.</keyFinding>

3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study provides a high-resolution map of excitatory neuron subtype vulnerability in human TLE, revealing that only select subpopulations—especially deep-layer L5–6_Fezf2_Tle4_Abo and upper-layer L2–3_Cux2_Frem3—undergo profound transcriptomic remodeling. The strong, layer-specific upregulation of AMPA receptor auxiliary subunits (notably CKAMP44/SHISA9) and glutamate receptor genes in these subtypes suggests new molecular mechanisms for epileptogenesis and potential therapeutic targets. The findings align with, but greatly extend, previous bulk and animal studies by pinpointing specific human cortical subtypes and their molecular signatures. Open questions include whether these transcriptomic changes are causal or compensatory, how they relate to seizure onset zones, and whether similar patterns are seen in other epilepsy types or brain regions. Future work should address the functional consequences of these molecular changes, their temporal dynamics, and their potential as biomarkers or intervention points. No explicit contradictions with prior models were discussed by the authors; rather, the study fills a gap in human single-cell data for epilepsy.

Disease focus: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD)
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on primary motor cortex (MCX, BA4) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC, BA9) from 73 donors (ALS, FTLD, and controls), yielding 625,973 high-quality nuclei. Cell type annotation and clustering were validated with canonical markers and cross-region comparisons. Key findings were validated with immunohistochemistry and stereology.
</methods>

<quickReference>
The study identifies two highly vulnerable excitatory neuron subtypes in cortical layer 5—VAT1L+ (including EYA4+ and THSD4+ subclusters) and SCN4B+ neurons—across ALS and FTLD, both enriched for ALS/FTLD genetic risk factors and showing convergent transcriptional dysregulation. The VAT1L+ population encompasses both Betz (motor cortex) and spindle (prefrontal cortex) neurons, with depletion and transcriptional changes strongly associated with disease status and C9orf72 genotype.
</quickReference>

<findings>
The authors provide a comprehensive single-nucleus transcriptomic atlas of human MCX and PFC in ALS, FTLD, and controls, with a focus on excitatory neuron diversity and disease vulnerability.

**Cell Type Proportions and Vulnerability**
Excitatory neurons, especially those in cortical layer 5, show the most pronounced transcriptional dysregulation and depletion in ALS and FTLD. Quantitative stereology confirmed a ~30% reduction of VAT1L+ neurons in MCX in ALS and a ~27% reduction in PFC in FTLD, with Betz cells (MCX) and spindle neurons (PFC) being most severely affected, but significant loss also observed among non-Betz VAT1L+ neurons (<keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Subtype Identification and Characterization**
The study identifies several excitatory neuron subtypes, with two being most relevant:
- **Ex L5 VAT1L+ (EYA4+ and THSD4+ subclusters):** These neurons are highly enriched for ALS/FTLD GWAS risk genes and express markers such as VAT1L, EYA4, THSD4, POU3F1, ARL13B, and NEFH. They encompass both Betz cells (MCX) and spindle neurons (PFC/ACC), but the majority lack these classic morphologies. These subtypes are transcriptionally nearly indistinguishable across regions and diseases, suggesting a shared molecular identity for vulnerable upper motor and spindle neurons (<keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).
- **Ex L3-5 SCN4B+ NEFH+ neurons:** This population expresses high levels of NEFH and SCN4B, is enriched for ALS/FTLD risk genes, and shows strong transcriptional dysregulation, particularly in MCX. Its disease relevance is newly highlighted here (<keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Defining Marker Genes and Functional Signatures**
- **VAT1L+ neurons:** VAT1L, EYA4, THSD4, POU3F1, ARL13B, NEFH, SULF2, CHST8, GRIN3A, SERPINE2. These neurons are characterized by long-range projections, large axon caliber, and enrichment for genes involved in axon structure, cilium assembly, and axoneme organization.
- **SCN4B+ neurons:** SCN4B, NEFH, ADRA1A, SULF2, VAT1L. These neurons are also associated with long-range projections and axonal maintenance.

**Disease Associations and Trajectories**
- Both VAT1L+ and SCN4B+ subtypes show the highest transcriptional divergence from controls in ALS and FTLD, with region- and disease-specific patterns: MCX VAT1L+ neurons are most affected in ALS, while PFC VAT1L+ neurons are most affected in FTLD. Loss of VAT1L+ neurons is not limited to Betz or spindle morphologies, indicating that molecular identity, rather than morphology, predicts vulnerability (<keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).
- Transcriptional changes include upregulation of axonal injury markers (NEFL, STMN2), heat shock proteins (HSP90AA1, HSPA8), and genes involved in mitochondrial/endosomal transport and cilium function. Downregulation of cilium/axoneme genes (e.g., BBS4, CFAP410) is prominent, especially in C9orf72 cases.

**Pathway Enrichment**
- Dysregulated pathways in VAT1L+ neurons include axon development/repair, cilium assembly, cytoskeletal organization, oxidative phosphorylation, and innate immune signaling. Cilium-related genes and pathways are highly enriched and downregulated in disease, suggesting a link to axonal vulnerability (<keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Genetic and Host Modulators**
- GWAS-based susceptibility scores and transcriptional divergence are highly correlated, with VAT1L+ and SCN4B+ neurons scoring highest. C9orf72 expansion carriers show broader downregulation of C9orf72 and cilium-related genes. No major sex or age effects are reported for these subtypes.

**Gene Regulatory Networks**
- Predicted upstream regulators of VAT1L+ neuron DEGs include MYT1L, REST, and SREBF2, implicating broad dysregulation of neuronal identity and cholesterol biosynthesis.

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**
- Immunohistochemistry confirms VAT1L expression in Betz and spindle neurons, as well as in morphologically typical L5 pyramidal neurons across MCX, PFC, and ACC. Stereology demonstrates region- and disease-specific depletion.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**
- The study is cross-sectional, but the pattern of VAT1L+ neuron loss and transcriptional changes suggests that molecular identity predicts vulnerability across disease progression.

**Genetic/Multi-omic Integration**
- Human VAT1L+ neurons are enriched for ALS/FTLD risk genes compared to mouse homologs, supporting species-specific vulnerability.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
Excitatory neuron subtypes in layer 5, especially VAT1L+ (Betz/spindle) and SCN4B+ neurons, are the principal targets of degeneration in ALS and FTLD, with molecular vulnerability transcending classic morphological definitions. Their enrichment for ALS/FTLD risk genes and cilium/axoneme-related pathways suggests that defects in axonal maintenance and ciliary function may underlie selective vulnerability. These findings imply that molecular profiling of VAT1L+ neurons could serve as a biomarker for disease progression and that targeting ciliary/axonal pathways may offer therapeutic opportunities. However, causality remains associative due to the cross-sectional design.
</clinical>

<researchImplications>
This study redefines the landscape of excitatory neuron vulnerability in ALS and FTLD, showing that molecular identity (VAT1L+ signature) rather than morphology (Betz/spindle) predicts susceptibility. The identification of cilium/axoneme-related gene downregulation as a convergent feature opens new avenues for mechanistic and therapeutic research. The strong correlation between genetic risk and transcriptional dysregulation in VAT1L+ and SCN4B+ neurons suggests that future studies should focus on the functional consequences of ciliary dysfunction and axonal maintenance in these subtypes. The findings align with, but also extend, previous models by demonstrating that vulnerable populations are larger and more molecularly homogeneous than previously thought. Open questions include the precise role of ciliary genes in neuron maintenance, the temporal sequence of transcriptional changes, and whether similar vulnerability signatures exist in other neurodegenerative diseases. The lack of a well-powered FTLD GWAS limits genetic integration for FTLD, and future work should address this gap.

# summary for Reiner 2021 (excitatory neurons)

**Quick Reference**

Single-nucleus RNA sequencing of ~275,000 nuclei from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia and control males revealed that ~96% of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were concentrated in five neuronal cell types, with excitatory neuron subtypes showing the greatest burden. These DEGs were enriched for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder GWAS loci, and implicated synaptic and neuronal signaling pathways, highlighting excitatory neuron dysfunction as a central feature of schizophrenia pathophysiology in this cohort of adult males.

Disease focus: Schizophrenia
</metadata>

<methods>
This study employed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to profile approximately 275,000 nuclei isolated from frozen postmortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) samples. The cohort consisted of 12 males with schizophrenia and 14 male controls. The analysis identified 20 transcriptomically distinct cell populations, with downstream analyses including differential gene expression, pathway enrichment, and regulatory network inference.
</methods>

<findings>
The principal finding of this study is that transcriptomic alterations in schizophrenia are highly cell-type specific, with a pronounced concentration in excitatory neuron subtypes. Of the 4,766 differential expression events identified (across 2,994 unique genes), approximately 96% were localized to five neuronal cell types, which, based on the context and typical DLPFC composition, are likely dominated by excitatory neuron subtypes. <keyFinding priority='1'>This strong enrichment of DEGs in excitatory neurons underscores their central involvement in schizophrenia-associated molecular pathology.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

The differentially expressed genes in these excitatory neuron subtypes were significantly enriched for loci previously implicated in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder by genome-wide association studies (GWAS). <keyFinding priority='1'>This genetic enrichment provides convergent evidence that the observed transcriptomic changes in excitatory neurons are not only disease-associated but also genetically driven.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Cluster-specific analyses revealed that the DEGs in excitatory neurons were involved in synaptic signaling, neuronal communication, and canonical pathways relevant to neurotransmission. Although the abstract does not enumerate the precise subtypes or marker genes, the identification of 20 transcriptomic clusters and the focus on five neuronal types suggest a nuanced heterogeneity within the excitatory neuron population. <keyFinding priority='2'>Gene ontology and KEGG pathway analyses further implicated synaptic and neuronal signaling pathways as being disrupted in these excitatory neuron subtypes.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

The study also identified microRNAs and transcription factors with overrepresented targets in neuronal cell types, suggesting that regulatory network alterations may underlie the observed gene expression changes in excitatory neurons. However, the abstract does not specify which regulatory factors or miRNAs are most relevant to excitatory neuron subtypes. <keyFinding priority='3'>The implication of regulatory elements points to possible upstream mechanisms for the observed transcriptomic dysregulation.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

No explicit mention is made of changes in the proportion of excitatory neurons or their subtypes between schizophrenia and control samples, nor are spatial or morphological validation data described in the abstract. The findings are based on cross-sectional, postmortem data, and while the sample size is relatively robust for snRNA-seq studies, the conclusions regarding disease mechanisms remain associative. <keyFinding priority='2'>The lack of reported changes in cell-type proportions suggests that the primary pathology may be functional (transcriptomic) rather than due to loss or gain of excitatory neuron subpopulations.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

The study does not discuss modulators such as age, sex, or genetic risk alleles (e.g., APOE) in relation to excitatory neuron subtypes, nor does it provide evidence for disease progression or aging trajectories within these populations. Similarly, there is no mention of cell-cell communication or ligand-receptor analysis specific to excitatory neurons.

Overall, the study provides strong evidence that excitatory neuron subtypes in the DLPFC are the principal locus of transcriptomic dysregulation in schizophrenia, with these changes being both genetically enriched and functionally relevant to synaptic signaling. <keyFinding priority='1'>This cell-type specificity advances our understanding of schizophrenia pathophysiology and highlights excitatory neurons as a key target for future research.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
The findings implicate excitatory neuron dysfunction—particularly at the level of gene expression and synaptic signaling pathways—as a central mechanism in schizophrenia. The enrichment of DEGs for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder GWAS loci suggests that genetic risk converges on excitatory neuron biology in the DLPFC. While the study does not establish causality, these results support the hypothesis that altered excitatory neuron function may underlie core cognitive and behavioral symptoms of schizophrenia. Potential therapeutic strategies could focus on restoring excitatory neuron transcriptomic homeostasis or targeting disrupted synaptic pathways. However, further work is needed to validate these findings in larger and more diverse cohorts, and to determine whether these transcriptomic changes are causal or compensatory.
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications**

This study reinforces the centrality of excitatory neuron dysfunction in the molecular pathology of schizophrenia, particularly in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. The strong enrichment of differentially expressed genes in excitatory neuron subtypes, and their overlap with genetic risk loci, suggests that future research should focus on dissecting the heterogeneity of these subtypes, identifying their specific marker genes, and clarifying their roles in disease onset and progression. Open questions include whether these transcriptomic changes reflect developmental, compensatory, or degenerative processes, and how they interact with environmental or pharmacological factors. The lack of explicit subtype names or marker genes in the abstract limits direct comparison with established excitatory neuron classification schemes, but the identification of 20 transcriptomic clusters hints at substantial heterogeneity. No explicit conflicts with prior models are discussed, and the findings are broadly consistent with the prevailing view that excitatory neuron dysfunction is a core feature of schizophrenia. Future studies should aim to integrate spatial, morphological, and longitudinal data to further elucidate the role of excitatory neuron subtypes in disease pathogenesis.

Renthal W, Boxer LD, Hrvatin S, et al. Characterization of human mosaic Rett syndrome brain tissue by single-nucleus RNA sequencing. Nature Neuroscience. 2018 Dec;21(12):1670-1679. doi:10.1038/s41593-018-0270-6  
Disease focus: Rett syndrome (RTT), an X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder caused by MECP2 mutations.
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on postmortem occipital cortex from three female Rett syndrome patients (MECP2 R255X mutation) and on visual cortex from mosaic female Mecp2+/– mice. A novel SNP-based approach was used to assign each nucleus as wild-type (WT) or mutant (mutant transcriptotype) based on allele-specific SNPs in cis with the MECP2 mutation. Cell types were identified using canonical markers (e.g., SLC17A7 for excitatory neurons). Differential expression and pathway analyses were performed, and findings were integrated with cell-type-specific DNA methylation and MeCP2 ChIP-seq data.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Excitatory neurons (SLC17A7+) were the most abundant cell type in both mouse and human datasets. In human Rett cortex, approximately 50% of excitatory neurons expressed the mutant MECP2 allele, consistent with random X-inactivation and no major skewing.

**Differential Gene Expression:**  
In mosaic female mice, 734 genes were differentially expressed between mutant and WT excitatory neurons (366 upregulated, 368 downregulated; FDR < 0.1). In human Rett cortex, 3,158 genes were differentially expressed between mutant and WT excitatory neurons (FDR < 0.01). The magnitude of gene expression changes was modest for individual genes.

**Pathway Enrichment:**  
Upregulated genes in mutant excitatory neurons were enriched for metabolic processes, ion transport, and nervous system development. Downregulated genes included those involved in synaptic signaling and neurotrophin pathways.

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
The study did not report distinct molecular subtypes of excitatory neurons beyond the SLC17A7+ population. Instead, the focus was on comparing WT and mutant transcriptotypes within this broad class.  
- **WT excitatory neurons:** Expressed normal levels of MECP2 and served as internal controls.
- **Mutant excitatory neurons:** Expressed the R255X MECP2 allele, with reduced MECP2 transcript and protein levels.  
  - **Defining markers:** Upregulation of highly methylated, long genes; downregulation of genes such as BDNF and NRXN2.
  - **Functional signature:** Upregulation of genes with high gene-body DNA methylation and MeCP2 binding; downregulation of neurotrophic and synaptic genes.
  - **Disease association:** The proportion of mutant excitatory neurons (~50%) is consistent with disease severity in RTT.

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
- The degree of gene upregulation in mutant excitatory neurons correlated with gene-body DNA methylation (mCH, r=0.22 in human; r=0.38 in mouse) and MeCP2 binding (mouse ChIP-seq, r=0.41).
- Gene length further modulated upregulation, but only for highly methylated genes.
- No evidence for major changes in excitatory neuron subtype composition or spatial distribution was reported.

**Gene Regulatory Networks:**  
- MECP2 acts as a cell-autonomous repressor of highly methylated long genes in excitatory neurons.
- Many upregulated genes encode transcriptional regulators (e.g., AUTS2, RBFOX1).

**Cell-Cell Communication:**  
- Non-cell-autonomous effects were observed: WT excitatory neurons from Mecp2+/– mice showed gene expression abnormalities (233 DEGs) not directly explained by MECP2 binding or methylation, suggesting indirect effects from neighboring mutant cells.

**Spatial Analysis:**  
- No spatial transcriptomics or in situ validation of excitatory neuron subpopulations was performed.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
- No explicit pseudotime or trajectory analysis was reported, but the study emphasizes that cell-autonomous gene dysregulation is present in adult tissue.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
- Integration with single-cell methylome data showed that cell-type-specific mCH patterns predict the degree of MECP2-dependent gene dysregulation.
- 58 upregulated and 84 downregulated genes were evolutionarily conserved MECP2 targets in both mouse and human excitatory neurons.

<keyFinding priority='1'>

<clinical>
Excitatory neurons are the principal cell type exhibiting cell-autonomous transcriptional dysregulation in Rett syndrome, with upregulation of highly methylated, long genes and downregulation of neurotrophic and synaptic genes. These changes are likely to contribute to the neurological and metabolic deficits of RTT, although causality is inferred from cross-sectional data. The proportion of mutant excitatory neurons (~50%) aligns with clinical severity. The findings suggest that targeting the methylation-dependent repression pathway in excitatory neurons may have therapeutic potential, and that the identified conserved gene set could serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets.
</clinical>

---

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**  
In Rett syndrome, excitatory neurons exhibit a robust, cell-autonomous upregulation of highly methylated, long genes when expressing mutant MECP2, with the degree of dysregulation directly predicted by gene-body mCH and MeCP2 binding (<keyFinding priority='1'>). This signature is conserved between mouse and human, and the proportion of mutant excitatory neurons (~50%) reflects random X-inactivation. Non-cell-autonomous effects are also observed in WT neurons but are not directly linked to MECP2. The study highlights the central role of DNA methylation in driving excitatory neuron pathology in RTT.

---

**Research Implications (≈150 words):**  
This study establishes a robust framework for dissecting cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous effects of X-linked mutations in mosaic human brain tissue. For excitatory neurons, the methylation-dependent upregulation of long genes is a conserved, high-confidence signature of MECP2 dysfunction, supporting the use of mouse models for mechanistic and therapeutic studies. The absence of distinct molecular subtypes within excitatory neurons in this dataset suggests that MECP2 dysfunction broadly affects this population rather than specific subtypes, though deeper sequencing or spatial profiling may reveal further heterogeneity. Open questions include the precise mechanisms linking MECP2 loss to downregulation of neurotrophic and synaptic genes, the functional consequences of non-cell-autonomous effects, and whether similar principles apply to other X-linked neurodevelopmental disorders. The findings align with and extend prior models of MECP2 as a methylation-dependent repressor, with no explicit contradictions discussed. Future work should address temporal dynamics, subtype-specific vulnerabilities, and therapeutic reversibility in excitatory neurons.

# summary for Rexach 2024 (excitatory neurons)

1) **Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This cross-disorder single-nucleus RNA-seq/ATAC-seq study (Rexach et al., 2024, Cell) profiled excitatory neurons across Alzheimer’s disease (AD), behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), and progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) in three cortical regions. The authors identified disease- and layer-specific vulnerability of excitatory neuron subtypes: layer 5 intratelencephalic (IT) neurons in AD, layer 2/3 IT neurons in bvFTD, and layer 5/6 near-projection (NP) neurons in PSP. Key marker genes (e.g., KCNH7, OPCML, PDE1C, NLGN1) were consistently downregulated in vulnerable subtypes. Genetic risk variants (e.g., PSP GWAS genes) were enriched in the most affected subpopulations, and transcriptional regulators such as RORB and MAFG/NFE2L1 modulated vulnerability and resilience.

These neurons expressed PSP GWAS risk genes (RUNX2, KANSL1, ARL17B, MAPT, ASAP1, LINC02210-CRHR1, SP1), and showed loss of MAFG/NFE2L1 regulon activity, which is associated with proteostasis and resilience. <keyFinding priority='1'>Enrichment of PSP risk genes in this population provides a direct genetic link to selective vulnerability.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Shared and Distinct Marker Genes**
Across all three diseases, the most vulnerable EX subtypes shared downregulation of KCNH7, OPCML, PDE1C, and NLGN1. These genes are implicated in neuronal excitability, synaptic function, and resilience to toxic stress. <keyFinding priority='2'>Their consistent loss across disorders suggests a convergent mechanism of vulnerability.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Functional Signatures and Pathways**
- Vulnerable EX subtypes showed signatures of impaired synaptic function, calcium signaling, and proteostasis.
- Pseudotime analysis in bvFTD layer 2/3 IT neurons revealed a trajectory from depleted (INS_EX-2) to disease-enriched (INS_EX-5) states, with RORB and KCNH7 marking the most vulnerable cells.
- MAFG/NFE2L1 regulon activity was highest in resilient EX clusters and lowest in depleted populations, especially in PSP. This regulon includes genes involved in autophagy and stress response (e.g., SQSTM1, VCP).

**Gene Regulatory Networks**
- RORB was identified as a key transcriptional repressor in vulnerable EX neurons, with increased promoter occupancy and chromatin accessibility in disease (snATAC-seq validation).
- MAFG/NFE2L1 regulon activity correlated with neuronal resilience and inversely with tau pathology scores.
- In PSP, loss of MAFG/NFE2L1 activity in INS_EX-13 was associated with increased vulnerability.

**Genetic Risk Integration**
- GWAS risk genes for AD, bvFTD, and PSP were enriched in the most vulnerable EX subtypes for each disorder.
- For PSP, 13/15 risk genes were significantly upregulated in depleted layer 5/6 NP neurons.
- This genetic enrichment supports a causal link between risk variants and selective neuronal vulnerability.

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**
- Immunohistochemistry confirmed depletion of KCNH7+ neurons in AD layer 5 and GPC6+ neurons in bvFTD layer 2/3.
- Bulk RNA-seq deconvolution validated loss of vulnerable EX subtypes in affected regions.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**
- Pseudotime and pathology correlations suggest that loss of resilience markers (e.g., KCNH7, RORB) tracks with increasing tau pathology and neurodegeneration.

<clinical>
Excitatory neuron subtypes display disease- and layer-specific vulnerability in tauopathies, with genetic risk variants and transcriptional regulators converging on the most affected populations. The identification of shared marker genes (KCNH7, OPCML, PDE1C, NLGN1) and regulatory networks (RORB, MAFG/NFE2L1) highlights potential therapeutic targets for enhancing neuronal resilience. These findings suggest that interventions aimed at modulating these pathways could mitigate selective neuronal loss in dementia. However, causal claims are tempered by the cross-sectional nature of the data, and further experimental validation is needed.

3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study provides a comprehensive cross-disorder atlas of excitatory neuron vulnerability in human dementias, revealing both convergent and disease-specific mechanisms. The consistent downregulation of KCNH7, OPCML, PDE1C, and NLGN1 in vulnerable subtypes across AD, bvFTD, and PSP suggests a shared molecular axis of excitatory neuron degeneration. The enrichment of genetic risk variants in the most affected subpopulations directly links GWAS findings to cell-type-specific pathology. The identification of RORB as a stress-induced repressor and MAFG/NFE2L1 as a resilience-promoting regulon offers mechanistic insight and potential intervention points.

Open questions include whether these molecular signatures are causal or consequential to neurodegeneration, and whether modulating RORB or MAFG/NFE2L1 activity can enhance neuronal survival in vivo. The study’s findings align with, but also extend, previous classification schemes by providing direct cross-disorder comparisons and integrating genetic risk. No explicit contradictions with prior models were discussed by the authors. Future work should address temporal dynamics, functional validation, and the potential for targeting these pathways therapeutically in human disease.

# summary for Ruzicka 2020 (excitatory neurons)

1) **Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This large-scale single-nucleus RNA-seq study of human prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia (Ruzicka et al., 2020, medRxiv) identifies seven excitatory neuron subtypes, including a novel superficial-layer state (Ex-SZTR) enriched in schizophrenia cases with “transcriptional resilience.” Deep-layer cortico-cortical projection neurons (Ex-L5/6-CCb) and Ex-SZTR show the most pronounced transcriptional changes, with key marker genes including CUX2, RORB, TLE4, NRGN, and FEZF2. Disease-associated gene expression is strongly modulated by genetic risk loci, with transcriptional regulators such as TCF4, MEF2C, SOX5, and SATB2 acting as major drivers. Ex-SZTR is particularly enriched in schizophrenia individuals with less global transcriptomic pathology.

Validation included fluorescence in situ hybridization (RNAscope) and CUT&Tag for transcription factor binding.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Identification**

Excitatory neurons were systematically classified into seven major subtypes, each with distinct laminar and molecular signatures:

- **Superficial-layer excitatory neurons (Ex-L2/3, Ex-L4, Ex-L4/5):** Marked by CUX2 and CBLN2 (layers II/III), RORB and FOXP2 (layer IV/V).
- **Deep-layer excitatory neurons (Ex-L5, Ex-L5/6):** Marked by TLE4, SEMA3E, HTR2C.
- **Cortico-fugal projection neurons (Ex-L5/6):** FEZF2+.
- **Two deep-layer cortico-cortical projection neuron subtypes (Ex-L5/6-CCa, Ex-L5/6-CCb):** Ex-L5/6-CCa enriched for dopamine signaling genes; Ex-L5/6-CCb for glutamate signaling genes, suggesting distinct connectivity and physiological roles.

<keyFinding priority='1'>A novel cross-cutting excitatory neuron state, Ex-SZTR (“schizophrenia transcriptional resilience”), was identified, predominantly in superficial layers, marked by NRGN, BEX1, BEX3, CALM3, and YWHAH. Ex-SZTR is significantly more prevalent in schizophrenia cases with globally less-perturbed transcriptomes, suggesting a resilient or compensatory state.</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**

- Across all cell types, 1,637 genes were upregulated and 2,492 downregulated in schizophrenia, with the majority of changes in neurons.
- Ex-SZTR had the highest number of upregulated genes, while Ex-L5/6-CCb had the most downregulated genes.
- Key DEGs in excitatory neurons included TCF4 (upregulated in 14/20 cell types), CLU (broadly overexpressed), and members of the neurexin (NRXN1/2/3) and SHANK gene families, implicating synaptic organization and function.
- Pathway analysis revealed pan-neuronal enrichment for postsynaptic organization, synaptic plasticity, and neurodevelopmental processes. Upregulated genes were more associated with neurodevelopmental pathways, while downregulated genes were linked to glutamate signaling and synaptic plasticity.
- Ex-SZTR specifically showed enrichment for cytoskeletal and morphogenesis pathways (e.g., lamellipodium organization, axon guidance), consistent with prior reports of altered pyramidal cell morphology in superficial layers in schizophrenia.

<keyFinding priority='2'>Transcriptional pathology scores (TPS) showed that individuals with abundant Ex-SZTR neurons had the lowest global schizophrenia-associated transcriptomic signatures, even lower than most controls, supporting the “resilience” hypothesis for this state.</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Genetic and Regulatory Modulators**

- Cell-type-specific DEGs were significantly enriched in proximity to schizophrenia GWAS loci, especially in excitatory neurons (notably Ex-SZTR and deep-layer subtypes).
- Several GWAS loci were explained by DEGs uniquely dysregulated in Ex-SZTR (e.g., CPEB1, GPR135, ZNF804A), or with opposite regulation in Ex-SZTR versus other subtypes (e.g., BCL11B, RALGAPA2).
- Integration with H-MAGMA and chromatin interaction data confirmed that genetic risk variants preferentially affect excitatory neuron subtypes, especially Ex-SZTR and deep-layer cortico-cortical neurons.
- Transcriptional regulators TCF4, MEF2C, SOX5, and SATB2 were identified as master regulators of schizophrenia-associated gene expression in excitatory neurons. CUT&Tag experiments confirmed their binding to regulatory elements of DEGs, and their targets were enriched for both neurodevelopmental and synaptic pathways.
- Upregulated genes in excitatory neurons were linked to fetal-stage enhancers, while downregulated genes were associated with adult or shared enhancers, suggesting developmental stage-specific regulatory disruption.

<keyFinding priority='1'>The convergence of genetic risk, transcriptional dysregulation, and regulatory network perturbation on excitatory neuron subtypes—especially Ex-SZTR and deep-layer cortico-cortical neurons—provides a mechanistic link between neurodevelopmental and synaptic models of schizophrenia.</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Morphological and Spatial Validation**

- RNAscope validated cell-type-specific and differential expression of TCF4, CLU, SHANK2, and UNC13A in superficial-layer excitatory neurons (CUX2+), confirming both directionality and cell-type specificity.
- Quantitative imaging showed highest expression in schizophrenia, lower in controls, and lowest in transcriptionally resilient (Ex-SZTR-enriched) individuals for TCF4 and CLU, with the opposite for SHANK2 and UNC13A.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**

- The Ex-SZTR state is not associated with medication exposure, suggesting it is not a treatment artifact.
- The presence of Ex-SZTR is correlated with reduced global transcriptomic pathology, indicating a possible compensatory or protective trajectory in some schizophrenia cases.

</findings>

<clinical>
Excitatory neuron subtypes, especially deep-layer cortico-cortical projection neurons and the novel Ex-SZTR state, are central to schizophrenia-associated molecular pathology. The Ex-SZTR state may represent a transcriptionally resilient or compensatory population, potentially mitigating global disease-associated transcriptomic changes. The convergence of genetic risk, transcriptional dysregulation, and regulatory network perturbation in these subtypes supports their mechanistic relevance. These findings suggest that targeting regulatory networks (e.g., TCF4, MEF2C, SOX5, SATB2) or enhancing resilience mechanisms in excitatory neurons could be promising therapeutic strategies, though causality remains to be established.
</clinical>

---

3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study provides a high-resolution atlas of excitatory neuron heterogeneity in schizophrenia, revealing both expected (deep-layer projection neurons) and novel (Ex-SZTR) subtypes as key sites of disease-associated transcriptional change. The identification of Ex-SZTR as a “resilient” state—enriched in schizophrenia cases with less global transcriptomic pathology—raises important questions about the mechanisms of resilience and compensation in psychiatric disease. The strong alignment of marker genes and subtypes with known laminar and functional classifications supports the robustness of the findings. The convergence of genetic risk, transcriptional dysregulation, and regulatory network perturbation on specific excitatory neuron subtypes provides a mechanistic bridge between neurodevelopmental and synaptic hypotheses of schizophrenia. Open questions include the causal role of Ex-SZTR in resilience, the developmental origins of subtype-specific vulnerability, and the potential for targeting regulatory networks therapeutically. The study’s findings are largely consistent with prior models but extend them by providing cell-type and state-specific resolution; no explicit contradictions with previous data are discussed by the authors.

# summary for Ruzicka 2024 (excitatory neurons)

1) **Quick Reference**

This large-scale single-nucleus RNA-seq study of human prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia (Ruzicka et al., Science 2024) identifies excitatory neurons as the most transcriptionally affected cell type, with pronounced downregulation of synaptic and neurodevelopmental genes across multiple excitatory subtypes. Deep-layer excitatory neurons (notably Ex-L56 and Ex-L6b_SEMA3E) show the strongest association with both common and rare schizophrenia risk variants, and a core module of transcription factors (including TCF4, MEF2C, SATB2) is implicated as a regulatory driver of these disease-associated changes.

<methods>
This study performed multiplexed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on postmortem prefrontal cortex (PFC) tissue from 140 individuals (75 schizophrenia, 65 controls) across two independent cohorts (McLean, MSSM), yielding 468,727 high-quality nuclei.

</methods>

<findings>

No significant change in the overall abundance of excitatory neurons or their subtypes was detected between schizophrenia and control groups, indicating that observed transcriptomic alterations are not due to cell loss but to changes in gene expression within these populations. <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Excitatory Neuron Subtypes and Characterization:**  
Excitatory neurons were the most transcriptionally affected cell class in schizophrenia, accounting for 77% of all DEGs (n=5129/6634). Subtypes were defined by cortical layer and projection identity, including:

- **Ex-L2, Ex-L23, Ex-L3:** Superficial-layer cortico-cortical projection neurons, marked by RORB and other layer-specific markers.
- **Ex-L45_MET, Ex-L45_LRRK1, Ex-L5b_HTR2C:** Mid-layer subtypes.
- **Ex-L56:** Deep-layer corticofugal projection neurons, marked by FEZF2.
- **Ex-L56_CC_NTNG2, Ex-L6_CC_SEMA3A, Ex-L6b_SEMA3D, Ex-L6b_SEMA3E:** Deep-layer cortico-cortical subtypes, marked by NTNG2, SEMA3A, and SEMA3E.

For each subtype, DEGs were highly cell-type specific, with nearly half of all DEGs altered in only one cell type. <keyFinding priority='1'>Excitatory neuron subtypes, especially deep-layer populations (Ex-L56, Ex-L6b_SEMA3E), showed the largest number and magnitude of schizophrenia-associated gene expression changes.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathways:**  
- The majority of DEGs in excitatory neurons were downregulated in schizophrenia (77% of all DEGs).
- Downregulated genes were strongly enriched for synaptic structure/function (e.g., NRXN3, SHANK2, DLG5), neurodevelopment, and intracellular signaling.
- Upregulated DEGs were more common in superficial-layer excitatory neurons (Ex-L23), while downregulation predominated in deep-layer subtypes (Ex-L2, Ex-L6_SEMA3A).
- Pathway analysis revealed overrepresentation of neurodevelopmental processes, synaptic signaling (anterograde trans-synaptic signaling, AMPA/NMDA receptor regulation), and one-carbon metabolism.
- Synaptic compartment genes (SynGO) were significantly enriched among excitatory neuron DEGs, especially postsynaptic components. <keyFinding priority='2'>This supports a model of synaptic dysfunction as central to schizophrenia pathophysiology.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Subtype-Specific Disease Associations:**  
- **Ex-L56**: DEGs most strongly associated with common schizophrenia GWAS risk variants.
- **Ex-L6b_SEMA3E**: DEGs most strongly associated with rare protein-coding risk variants.
- **Ex-L23**: Largest number of upregulated DEGs, with enrichment for neurodevelopmental and synaptic pathways.
- **Ex-L2, Ex-L6_SEMA3A**: Largest number of downregulated DEGs, with broad pathway enrichment.
- Several high-confidence schizophrenia risk genes (e.g., GRIN2A, NRXN3, BSN, SOBP) were downregulated specifically in deep-layer excitatory neurons. <keyFinding priority='1'>This demonstrates convergence of genetic risk and transcriptomic pathology in specific excitatory neuron subtypes.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Gene Regulatory Networks:**  
A core module of 24 transcription factors (TFs), including TCF4, MEF2C, SATB2, FOXP2, and RORB, was identified as a regulatory driver of schizophrenia DEGs in excitatory neurons. CUT&Tag experiments in human PFC neurons validated that binding sites for MEF2C, SATB2, and TCF4 are significantly enriched at schizophrenia DEGs in excitatory neurons. <keyFinding priority='1'>This TF module is genetically linked to both schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental delay, suggesting a shared regulatory architecture.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell-State Heterogeneity and Disease Trajectories:**  
Matrix decomposition identified two major neuronal cell states associated with schizophrenia:
- **Ex_SZCS**: An excitatory neuron state with high expression of schizophrenia DEGs, enriched for synaptic and one-carbon metabolism genes (e.g., DHFR, GRIN1, EPHA6, CHD5, CNTNAP2).
- **Ex_SZTR**: An excitatory neuron state with an inverse association to schizophrenia pathology.
These cell states segregated individuals into transcriptionally defined subgroups, partially independent of clinical diagnosis or polygenic risk score (PRS), suggesting molecular heterogeneity within schizophrenia. <keyFinding priority='2'>Transcriptional pathology scores (TPS) based on excitatory neuron signatures identified subgroups of schizophrenia patients with and without canonical transcriptomic changes.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
No significant effects of age, sex, or postmortem interval were detected on excitatory neuron DEGs after covariate adjustment. Polygenic risk scores correlated with overall transcriptional pathology but did not distinguish molecular subgroups within schizophrenia.

**Spatial/Morphological Validation:**  
Layer-specific marker expression and in situ hybridization confirmed the anatomical identity of excitatory neuron subtypes. No evidence of excitatory neuron loss was found, supporting a model of functional rather than numerical alteration.

**Genetic/Multi-omic Integration:**  
DEGs in excitatory neurons were significantly enriched for both common and rare schizophrenia risk variants, with deep-layer subtypes showing the strongest associations. TF module genes overlapped with GWAS and exome sequencing hits for schizophrenia and neurodevelopmental disorders.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

</findings>

<clinical>
Excitatory neurons, particularly deep-layer subtypes, are the principal site of schizophrenia-associated transcriptomic dysregulation in the human PFC. These changes converge on synaptic and neurodevelopmental pathways, are driven by a core TF module, and are enriched for genetic risk variants. The findings suggest that excitatory neuron dysfunction—rather than cell loss—may underlie key aspects of schizophrenia pathophysiology, with implications for targeting synaptic and regulatory mechanisms in future therapies. The identification of molecularly distinct subgroups within schizophrenia may inform personalized approaches to diagnosis and treatment, though causal relationships remain to be established. <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</clinical>

3) **Research Implications**

This study provides a high-confidence, cell-type-resolved map of schizophrenia transcriptomic pathology, highlighting excitatory neuron subtypes—especially those in deep cortical layers—as the primary locus of disease-associated gene expression changes. The convergence of common and rare genetic risk, synaptic and neurodevelopmental pathway dysregulation, and a core TF regulatory module (including TCF4, MEF2C, SATB2) in these neurons supports and extends prior models of excitatory neuron vulnerability in schizophrenia. The identification of molecularly defined subgroups within schizophrenia, partially independent of clinical diagnosis or PRS, raises important questions about disease heterogeneity and the potential for transcriptomic biomarkers. Open questions include the causal direction of these changes, their developmental timing, and their relationship to clinical phenotypes. The study’s findings are broadly consistent with, but more granular than, previous bulk and single-nucleus studies, and no explicit contradictions with prior models are discussed by the authors. Future work should address longitudinal dynamics, functional consequences, and therapeutic targeting of the implicated excitatory neuron subtypes and regulatory networks.

Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with emphasis on TREM2 R47H mutation effects.
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on mid-frontal cortex tissue from 46 AD patients (22 with common variant [CV]-TREM2, 24 with R47H-TREM2). Mouse models included heterozygous knock-in of human TREM2 (CV or R47H) crossed to P301S tauopathy mice. Validation included behavioral assays, immunostaining, and in situ hybridization.
</methods>

<quickReference>
Excitatory neurons in AD brains carrying the R47H-TREM2 mutation showed minimal cell-type–specific transcriptomic changes compared to other cell types, with no evidence for major disease-associated subpopulations or shifts in abundance. The R47H mutation’s impact on excitatory neurons was not sex-specific and was far less pronounced than in microglia, with only a small number of differentially expressed genes and no clear functional or pathological associations. <keyFinding priority='3'>Excitatory neuron transcriptomic changes in R47H-TREM2 AD brains are sparse and not a major driver of the observed disease phenotype; no major genetic or demographic modifiers were identified for this cell type.</keyFinding>
</quickReference>

<findings>
The study’s primary focus was on microglia, but excitatory neurons were included in the snRNA-seq analysis of human AD cortex. Cell type annotation confirmed the presence of excitatory neurons across all samples, with no significant differences in their overall proportion between R47H and CV-TREM2 carriers (<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>). The authors explicitly note that, while some samples had very few excitatory neurons, this was not systematically associated with genotype or sex.

Differential gene expression analysis revealed that the R47H mutation induced many more transcriptional changes in glial cells (especially microglia) than in excitatory neurons. In excitatory neurons, the number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between R47H and CV-TREM2 samples was low in both sexes, and there was little overlap with DEGs from other cell types (<keyFinding priority='3'>). The volcano plots and summary tables show that, for excitatory neurons, only a handful of genes reached significance, and these did not cluster into recognizable disease-associated modules or pathways.

No distinct excitatory neuron subtypes or disease-associated states were identified in the context of the R47H mutation. The authors did not report any major shifts in excitatory neuron abundance, nor did they observe the emergence of novel subpopulations or altered spatial/morphological features in this cell type (<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>). Pathway enrichment analysis for excitatory neuron DEGs did not yield significant results, and there was no evidence for upregulation of inflammatory, stress-response, or synaptic dysfunction pathways specifically in R47H carriers.

In the mouse tauopathy model, bulk RNA-seq of hippocampal tissue from female P301S R47H-hTREM2 mice showed downregulation of some neuron-associated genes (e.g., Adora2a, Syt6, Serpina9, Penk), but these changes were not specific to excitatory neurons and were interpreted as secondary to increased neuroinflammation rather than as evidence of a distinct excitatory neuron state (<keyFinding priority='2'>). No excitatory neuron subtypes or marker gene sets were described in the mouse single-cell or bulk transcriptomic data.

The study did not identify any genetic, demographic, or pathological modifiers (such as age, sex, or APOE genotype) that specifically influenced excitatory neuron states or gene expression in the context of the R47H mutation. All major findings regarding disease association, pathway activation, and therapeutic intervention (AKT inhibition) centered on microglia, with excitatory neurons showing only indirect or secondary effects.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
The data indicate that excitatory neurons do not exhibit major disease-associated transcriptomic changes or subpopulation shifts in AD brains carrying the R47H-TREM2 mutation. The lack of significant findings suggests that excitatory neurons are not a primary driver of the R47H-associated disease phenotype in this context. Any observed downregulation of neuronal genes in mouse models is likely a consequence of increased neuroinflammation and microglial activation, rather than a direct effect of the R47H mutation on excitatory neurons. There are no immediate therapeutic or biomarker implications for excitatory neuron subtypes based on this study.
</clinical>

<researchImplications>
This study highlights the cell-type specificity of the R47H-TREM2 mutation’s effects in AD, with microglia showing robust disease-associated states and excitatory neurons remaining largely unaffected at the transcriptomic level. The absence of distinct excitatory neuron subtypes or disease-associated states in R47H carriers suggests that future research should focus on glial-neuronal interactions and the indirect consequences of microglial activation on neuronal health. The findings are consistent with prior single-nucleus studies in AD that report limited excitatory neuron heterogeneity in late-stage disease, and the authors do not discuss any conflicts with existing neuron classification schemes. Open questions remain regarding potential subtle or early-stage excitatory neuron changes, which may require larger sample sizes or region-specific analyses to detect. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

# summary for Schirmer 2019 (excitatory neurons)

1) **Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This study (Schirmer et al., 2019, Nature) used single-nucleus RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics to reveal that excitatory neurons in upper cortical layers (specifically CUX2-expressing L2–L3 projection neurons) are selectively vulnerable in multiple sclerosis (MS). These neurons show marked loss in demyelinated cortex underlying meningeal inflammation, with upregulation of stress/death pathway genes (e.g., FAIM2, ATF4, CLU, B2M, HSPH1, HSP90AA1, PPIA, NORAD) and downregulation of synaptic/energy genes. This vulnerability is tightly linked to lesion stage and upper-layer demyelination, while other excitatory and inhibitory neuron subtypes are relatively spared.

GO analysis of L2–L3 ENs highlighted upregulation of pathways related to translational initiation, chaperone-mediated protein assembly, unfolded protein response, apoptosis, and oxidative stress. Downregulated pathways included mitochondrial energy metabolism and synaptic signaling.

**Spatial Analysis:**  
Spatial transcriptomics and smFISH validated the selective loss of CUX2+ neurons in demyelinated cortex, especially beneath inflamed meninges with plasma cell infiltration. Upregulation of stress markers (PPIA, NORAD) was confirmed in situ in L2–L3 ENs.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
Pseudotime analysis revealed that L2–L3 ENs from chronic inactive lesions (with extensive subpial demyelination) were most dysregulated, suggesting a trajectory of progressive stress and loss linked to lesion maturation.

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
Loss of CUX2+ ENs was most pronounced in areas with meningeal inflammation and plasma cell infiltration, implicating local immune environment as a driver. No explicit genetic or demographic modifiers (e.g., APOE, sex) were reported for EN vulnerability in this study.

**Gene Regulatory Networks:**  
Upregulation of lncRNAs (NORAD, BCYRN1) and stress-responsive transcription factors (ATF4) in L2–L3 ENs suggests altered gene regulatory networks under chronic stress.

**Cell-Cell Communication:**  
No direct ligand-receptor analysis for ENs, but the spatial association with meningeal plasma cells and glial activation is highlighted.

<clinical>
The study demonstrates that upper-layer excitatory neurons (CUX2+ L2–L3 ENs) are selectively vulnerable in MS, undergoing progressive loss and stress-related transcriptomic changes in demyelinated cortex, particularly beneath inflamed meninges. This selective neuronal loss may contribute to cortical atrophy and cognitive dysfunction in progressive MS. The findings suggest that therapies targeting meningeal inflammation or neuronal stress pathways could be beneficial. The preservation of other EN and IN subtypes highlights cell-type-specific vulnerability, with potential implications for biomarker development and neuroprotection strategies.

3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study provides strong evidence for selective vulnerability of upper-layer excitatory neurons (CUX2+ L2–L3 ENs) in MS, with a clear link to meningeal inflammation and lesion stage. The identification of a dynamic stress/death signature, including upregulation of lncRNAs (NORAD), heat-shock proteins, and apoptotic pathways, opens avenues for mechanistic studies of neuronal degeneration in MS. The preservation of other excitatory and inhibitory neuron subtypes suggests that interventions could be tailored to protect the most vulnerable populations. The findings align with, but also extend, prior models of cortical pathology in MS by providing cell-type and layer-specific resolution. Open questions include the precise mechanisms by which meningeal inflammation drives selective EN loss, the potential reversibility of early stress signatures, and whether similar patterns are seen in other neurodegenerative or inflammatory conditions. The study’s integration of snRNA-seq with spatial validation sets a benchmark for future work on neuronal heterogeneity and vulnerability in human disease.

Disease focus: Parkinson’s disease (PD)
</metadata>

<methods>
Parallel single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) and single-nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) were performed on temporal cortex tissue from 12 PD and 12 control donors. Over 200,000 nuclei were profiled, with cell type and subtype annotation via label transfer from a reference dataset. Differential gene expression and chromatin accessibility were analyzed using NEBULA and Cicero, with integration of GWAS loci and transcription factor (TF) motif analyses. No significant changes in cell type or subtype proportions were observed between PD and controls.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Excitatory neurons (Exc) were the second most abundant cell type (50,590 nuclei), with 12 transcriptionally distinct subtypes (Exc1–Exc12). No significant changes in overall excitatory neuron or subtype proportions were detected in PD versus controls.

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
The Exc5 cluster emerged as a key excitatory neuron subtype with pronounced PD-associated transcriptional dysregulation.  
<keyFinding priority='1'>Exc5 was the only neuronal subtype with robust and significant overexpression of SNCA (alpha-synuclein), a central PD risk gene and Lewy body component.</keyFinding>  
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>  
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

- **Exc5 (disease-associated glutamatergic neuron subtype):**
  - **Defining markers:** High expression of CBLN2, RASGRF2, CUX2, PHACTR2, LAMP5, HPCAL1, LINC00507, and LINC01500. SLC17A7 confirmed glutamatergic identity.
  - **Functional signature:** Upregulation of genes/pathways related to axon guidance (ROBO-SLIT, SEMA3C), neurite outgrowth, postsynaptic structure (CBLN2, GRIA4), and intracellular ion homeostasis (CACNA1E). Downregulation of presynaptic organization (SYNPR), synaptic transmission (KCNH5), inhibitory signal reception (GABRG3), and calcium-response genes (CDH6, PDE1C).
  - **Disease association:** Exc5 showed the highest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among all neuronal subtypes (n=3899), with strong polarization toward upregulation in PD. SNCA overexpression was unique to Exc5 among neurons.
  - **Spatial/morphological validation:** Not directly reported, but marker gene expression and pathway enrichment were robustly validated computationally.

- **Other Excitatory Subtypes:**  
  - Exc1 shared some marker expression with Exc5 but had far fewer DEGs.
  - Exc6, Exc7, and Exc9 showed primarily downregulated DEGs in PD, contrasting with the upregulation seen in Exc5 and most other Exc clusters.

**Differential Gene Expression & Pathway Enrichment:**  
- Exc5 upregulated pathways: axon guidance, neurite outgrowth, postsynaptic structure, ion homeostasis.
- Exc5 downregulated pathways: presynaptic organization, synaptic transmission, calcium response.
- Across all excitatory subtypes, upregulated DEGs were enriched for translation, proteasomal degradation, mitochondrial function, and intracellular transport; downregulated DEGs were enriched for chromatin organization, DNA damage response, apoptosis regulation, and recycling.

**Integration with PD Genetics:**  
- Exc5 DEGs included multiple genes within PD GWAS loci, notably SNCA, and others such as CBLN2 and MPP2.
- Chromatin accessibility (snATAC-seq) revealed increased accessibility in PD at regulatory regions of SNCA and other PD risk genes in Exc5.
- Cicero analysis identified candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) linked to Exc5 DEGs, with co-accessibility networks (CCANs) connecting distal regulatory elements to promoters/introns of PD risk genes.

**Gene Regulatory Networks & Modulators:**  
- TF motif enrichment in Exc5 cCREs highlighted YY1, SP3, and KLF16 as potential master regulators, all upregulated in PD and predicted to bind cCREs of multiple PD GWAS-DEGs (e.g., MPP2, ATXN7L3).
- Regulatory variants (SNVs/indels) in high linkage disequilibrium with PD GWAS SNPs were predicted to alter TF binding in Exc5 cCREs, potentially mediating risk via altered transcriptional networks.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
- The study focused on temporal cortex with mild pathology, suggesting Exc5 dysregulation may represent early or pre-degenerative molecular changes in PD cortical progression.

<keyFinding priority='1'>Exc5 is a glutamatergic neuron subtype uniquely susceptible to PD-associated gene dysregulation, with SNCA overexpression and altered regulatory networks involving PD risk variants and master TFs.</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
Exc5 glutamatergic neurons may play a pivotal role in PD cortical progression, as they uniquely overexpress SNCA and show broad dysregulation of genes involved in synaptic structure and function. The integration of genetic risk (GWAS loci), altered chromatin accessibility, and master TF networks (YY1, SP3, KLF16) suggests that Exc5 is a key cellular substrate for PD risk and progression. These findings point to Exc5 and its regulatory networks as potential targets for cell- and gene-specific therapeutic intervention and biomarker development, though causality remains to be experimentally validated.

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**  
A single-nucleus multi-omics study of Parkinson’s disease (PD) temporal cortex identified Exc5, a glutamatergic excitatory neuron subtype, as uniquely susceptible to PD-associated gene dysregulation. Exc5 showed robust overexpression of SNCA (alpha-synuclein) and upregulation of pathways related to axon guidance and postsynaptic structure, with downregulation of presynaptic and calcium-response genes. Regulatory network analysis implicated master transcription factors (YY1, SP3, KLF16) and PD GWAS-linked variants in Exc5-specific gene expression changes, highlighting Exc5 as a potential driver of cortical PD pathology and a candidate for targeted intervention.

---

**Research Implications (≈150 words):**  
This study provides the first comprehensive single-nucleus multi-omics map of PD at the excitatory neuron subtype level in human cortex, pinpointing Exc5 as a molecularly distinct, disease-susceptible glutamatergic neuron population. The Exc5 signature—marked by SNCA overexpression and broad transcriptional dysregulation—aligns with emerging models of selective neuronal vulnerability in PD, but extends these by integrating chromatin accessibility and genetic risk. The identification of master TFs (YY1, SP3, KLF16) and regulatory variants as putative drivers of Exc5 dysregulation offers mechanistic hypotheses for how non-coding GWAS risk may converge on specific neuronal subtypes. Open questions include the temporal sequence of Exc5 dysregulation relative to neurodegeneration, the functional consequences of altered Exc5 gene networks, and whether similar subtypes are vulnerable in other brain regions or PD models. The study’s findings are largely consistent with, but more granular than, prior bulk and single-cell PD transcriptomic studies; no explicit contradictions with previous data are discussed by the authors.

# summary for Smajic 2021 (excitatory neurons)

1) **Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This single-nucleus RNA-seq study of human midbrain in idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (IPD) identifies a disease-specific neuronal cluster (CADPS2^high) with low TH and high CADPS2/TIAM1 expression, nearly exclusive to IPD tissue, and likely representing dysfunctional dopaminergic neurons. Excitatory neurons (SLC17A6^+) are present but show no significant disease-associated changes in proportion or major subtype composition. Genetic risk variant enrichment analysis reveals that excitatory neuron marker genes are significantly associated with Parkinson’s disease risk, though less strongly than microglia or dopaminergic neurons, and this association is modulated by disease status. <keyFinding priority='2'>Excitatory neuron genetic risk enrichment is context-dependent and secondary to glial and dopaminergic signals.</keyFinding>

Validation included immunolabelling, digital PCR, and laser-capture microdissection.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Identification**  
Excitatory neurons were identified by high SLC17A6 expression, comprising a substantial neuronal population in both IPD and control midbrain. The study’s UMAP and clustering analyses delineated four main neuronal types: excitatory (SLC17A6^+), inhibitory (GAD2^+), GABAergic (GAD2/GRIK1^+), and dopaminergic neurons (TH^+), with an additional disease-specific CADPS2^high cluster. Excitatory neurons did not show significant changes in overall proportion between IPD and controls (<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>), nor were distinct disease-associated excitatory neuron subtypes reported. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Excitatory Neuron Subtypes and Marker Genes**  
The excitatory neuron cluster was defined by SLC17A6 (VGLUT2) expression, with additional markers including MAP2 and SCN2A. No further subclustering or disease-specific excitatory neuron states were described, and the study did not report major shifts in excitatory neuron heterogeneity or activation state in IPD. <keyFinding priority='3'>Excitatory neurons remain transcriptionally stable in IPD midbrain at the subtype level.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Disease-Specific Neuronal Cluster (CADPS2^high)**  
A small neuronal cluster (CADPS2^high, n=120) was almost exclusive to IPD (98.4% IPD, 1.6% control). These cells expressed neuronal markers (MAP2, SCN2A, TIAM1) but had low TH, suggesting a dysfunctional or degenerating dopaminergic identity. CADPS2^high cells did not overlap with the main excitatory neuron cluster and were not characterized by SLC17A6 expression. Digital PCR on laser-microdissected neuromelanin-positive neurons confirmed higher CADPS2 expression in IPD. <keyFinding priority='1'>The CADPS2^high cluster represents a novel, disease-specific neuronal state, but is not an excitatory neuron subtype.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**  
No significant differential gene expression or pathway enrichment was reported for excitatory neurons in IPD compared to controls. The main transcriptional changes in IPD were observed in glial populations (microglia, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes) and the CADPS2^high neuronal cluster. <keyFinding priority='3'>Excitatory neurons do not display major transcriptional perturbations in IPD midbrain.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Genetic Risk Variant Enrichment**  
MAGMA analysis revealed that excitatory neuron marker genes are significantly enriched for Parkinson’s disease risk variants (odds ratio >1, FDR<0.05), though this enrichment is less pronounced than in microglia or dopaminergic neurons. Notably, the association of risk variants with excitatory neuron genes is context-dependent: in IPD samples, microglia and neurons (including excitatory) show significant enrichment, while in controls, pericytes and OPCs are more strongly associated. <keyFinding priority='2'>Excitatory neuron genetic risk enrichment is significant but secondary to glial and dopaminergic signals, and is modulated by disease status.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators & Metrics**  
No specific modulators (age, sex, genotype) or quantitative activation/morphology scores were reported for excitatory neurons. The study’s beta-regression modelling indicated that disease status (IPD) was the primary driver of cell type composition changes, but this did not significantly affect excitatory neuron proportions. <keyFinding priority='3'>Excitatory neuron abundance is not significantly modulated by demographic or clinical variables in this cohort.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell-Cell Communication, Spatial Analysis, and Trajectories**  
No major findings regarding ligand-receptor interactions, spatial localization, or pseudotime/disease trajectory modelling were reported for excitatory neurons. The main spatial and trajectory analyses focused on glial activation and the CADPS2^high cluster. <keyFinding priority='3'>No evidence for altered excitatory neuron spatial distribution or disease trajectory in IPD midbrain.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**  
Excitatory neuron marker genes (e.g., SLC17A6, MAP2) contributed to the overall neuronal risk variant enrichment, but no specific eQTLs or multi-omic links were highlighted for excitatory neuron subtypes. <keyFinding priority='3'>Excitatory neuron genetic risk is part of a broader neuronal signature, not unique to this cell type.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
Excitatory neurons in the human midbrain do not show major compositional or transcriptional changes in idiopathic Parkinson’s disease, nor do they display disease-specific subtypes or activation states. However, their marker genes are significantly enriched for Parkinson’s disease risk variants, suggesting a potential, though secondary, role in disease susceptibility. The lack of overt excitatory neuron pathology contrasts with the pronounced glial activation and the emergence of the CADPS2^high neuronal cluster, which is likely dopaminergic in origin. These findings imply that excitatory neurons are not primary drivers of midbrain pathology in IPD, but may contribute to genetic risk in a context-dependent manner. <keyFinding priority='2'>Excitatory neurons are genetically implicated in IPD but show minimal phenotypic alteration in midbrain tissue.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</clinical>

---

3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study demonstrates that excitatory neurons in the human midbrain are relatively spared at the transcriptional and compositional level in idiopathic Parkinson’s disease, despite significant genetic risk variant enrichment. The absence of disease-specific excitatory neuron subtypes or activation states suggests that their contribution to IPD pathogenesis may be indirect or context-dependent, potentially mediated through network interactions or vulnerability to upstream glial or dopaminergic dysfunction. The genetic enrichment aligns with prior models implicating neuronal pathways in Parkinson’s disease risk, but the lack of overt excitatory neuron pathology in this dataset highlights the need for further research into their functional role, especially in early or preclinical disease stages. Future studies should explore excitatory neuron vulnerability in other brain regions, integrate electrophysiological or connectivity data, and assess whether subtle changes in excitatory neuron function contribute to disease progression or symptomatology. No explicit conflicts with prior excitatory neuron classification schemes or models were discussed by the authors. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

This study demonstrates that the human amygdala’s paralaminar nucleus (PL) contains a large population of immature excitatory neurons—primarily TBR1+ and VGLUT2+—that persist from birth through adolescence and mature predominantly during puberty. These late-maturing excitatory neurons, which are largely absent of GABAergic markers, decline in number as they mature, with their maturation rate and fate potentially modulated by sex hormones and environmental factors during puberty. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

- Disease focus: Neurodevelopment, with implications for neuropsychiatric disorders.
</metadata>

<methods>
This review synthesizes histological, immunohistochemical, and single-nucleus RNA-seq data from human and non-human primate amygdala, focusing on the paralaminar nucleus (PL). Key markers (DCX, PSA-NCAM, TBR1, VGLUT2, NEUN, BCL-2) and cell cycle proteins (Ki-67, SOX2) are used to define cell states. Quantitative analyses span birth to adulthood, with spatial and morphological validation.
</methods>

<findings>
The PL is a distinct subregion of the primate amygdala, comprising medial (MPL) and lateral (LPL) divisions, both densely populated by immature neurons at birth. These neurons are characterized by small somas, expression of immature markers (DCX, PSA-NCAM, BCL-2), and a lack of mature neuronal features. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell Type Proportions and Trajectory:**  
At birth, ~90% of PL cells are immature (DCX+PSA-NCAM+), declining gradually through childhood and adolescence. The MPL matures earlier than the LPL, with the proportion of immature neurons dropping most rapidly after birth and slowing around puberty (8–15 years). By adulthood, ~20–25% of PL cells remain immature, suggesting a protracted maturation timeline. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Subtype Characterization:**  
- **Immature Excitatory Neurons:**  
  - **Markers:** DCX+, PSA-NCAM+, BCL-2+, TBR1+ (in ~54% at age 13), VGLUT2+ (in 97.6% of mature NEUN+TBR1+ neurons), some calbindin+.
  - **Functional Signature:** Immature morphology, sparse synaptic input, low action potential frequency, not yet integrated into circuits.
  - **Classification:** Late-maturing, excitatory, non-GABAergic (only ~3% GAD67+).
  - **Spatial/Morphological Features:** Densely clustered near white matter, with some displaying migratory morphology (elongated processes, chain organization), especially in MPL.
  - **Disease/Developmental Association:** Decline in immature neuron proportion is most rapid in early life, stabilizing during puberty; maturation may be influenced by sex hormones (ERβ highly expressed in PL) and environmental factors.

- **Intermediate Neurons:**  
  - **Markers:** Co-express DCX, PSA-NCAM, and NEUN.
  - **Functional Signature:** Transitional state between immature and mature.
  - **Classification:** Intermediate maturity.

- **Mature Excitatory Neurons:**  
  - **Markers:** NEUN+, DCX–, PSA-NCAM–, TBR1+, VGLUT2+.
  - **Functional Signature:** Larger soma, complex morphology, integrated into circuits.
  - **Classification:** Mature excitatory.

**Homeostatic/Baseline Subpopulations:**  
A small population of mature neurons (NEUN+DCX–) is present at birth, but the majority of PL neurons mature postnatally.

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
- **Sex Hormones:** ERβ is highly expressed in the PL, suggesting estrogenic modulation of maturation, especially during puberty. Androgen receptor expression is low.
- **Cell Cycle/Progenitors:** SOX2+ and Ki-67+ cells are abundant at birth but decline rapidly; postnatal neurogenesis is rare, with most immature neurons likely generated prenatally.
- **Spatial Validation:** Immunostaining and single-nucleus RNA-seq confirm marker expression and spatial gradients of maturation (ventral-to-dorsal in MPL).

**Migration and Integration:**  
Some immature neurons display migratory morphology and may migrate short distances into adjacent amygdala subnuclei (BA, AB), potentially contributing to increases in mature neuron numbers in these regions during development. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Pathway Enrichment:**  
Immature neurons express genes involved in migration (DCX, PSA-NCAM, SOX11), survival (BCL-2), and excitatory identity (TBR1, VGLUT2).

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
The decline in immature neuron proportion and increase in mature neuron number is most pronounced in early childhood, with stabilization during puberty. This trajectory may be altered in neurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., ASD, MDD), though direct evidence is limited.

**Contradictions:**  
The authors note that while some studies suggest postnatal neurogenesis in the PL, the bulk of evidence supports prenatal generation with delayed maturation. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
Late-maturing excitatory neurons in the PL are positioned to influence amygdala circuit maturation during puberty, a critical period for emotional and social development. Their protracted maturation may underlie developmental plasticity in emotional learning and valence coding, and disruptions in their maturation trajectory could contribute to neuropsychiatric conditions such as ASD and MDD. The persistence of immature excitatory neurons into adulthood suggests a potential reservoir for plasticity or vulnerability in disease. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</clinical>

3) **Research Implications**

This study highlights the unique developmental trajectory of excitatory neurons in the human amygdala’s PL, emphasizing their prolonged immaturity and puberty-associated maturation. Open questions remain regarding the precise mechanisms regulating their maturation, the functional integration of these neurons into amygdala circuits, and the impact of sex hormones and environmental factors. The findings align with emerging models of delayed neuronal maturation in large-brained mammals and suggest that these neurons may contribute to developmental plasticity and disease vulnerability. Future research should focus on single-cell transcriptomic profiling across ages, direct lineage tracing, and functional studies to clarify the roles of these subtypes in health and disease. No explicit contradictions with prior models are discussed, but the rarity of postnatal neurogenesis in primates is emphasized as a departure from rodent models. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

1) **Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

Single-nucleus RNA-seq of postmortem cortex from autism spectrum disorder (ASD) patients reveals that upper-layer (L2/3) and layer 4 excitatory neurons exhibit the greatest burden of ASD-associated transcriptomic changes, with prominent downregulation of synaptic genes (e.g., STX1A, SYN2, NRXN1, TCF25, SOX5, RBFOX3). These changes are highly enriched for known ASD genetic risk factors and are most predictive of clinical severity. The dysregulation is specific to cortico-cortical projection neuron subtypes and is not explained by epilepsy comorbidity, highlighting upper-layer excitatory neurons as a key cellular substrate of ASD pathology. <keyFinding priority='1'></keyFinding>

</metadata>

<methods>
This study employed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) using the 10x Genomics platform on postmortem prefrontal cortex (PFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) tissue from 15 ASD patients and 16 matched controls (ages 4–22). Additional samples from epilepsy patients and controls were included for comparison. Unbiased clustering identified 17 major cell types, including multiple excitatory neuron subtypes, and in situ RNA hybridization validated key marker expression. Bulk RNA-seq and deconvolution analyses were used for cross-validation.
</methods>

<findings>
The central finding is that excitatory neurons, particularly those in upper cortical layers (L2/3) and layer 4, display the largest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in ASD compared to controls. Downsampling confirmed that this DEG burden is not simply due to higher gene expression in these neurons. <keyFinding priority='1'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**
- **L2/3 Excitatory Neurons:** These upper-layer cortico-cortical projection neurons are most affected, with prominent downregulation of synaptic and neurodevelopmental genes. Key downregulated genes include STX1A, SYN2, NRXN1, TCF25, SOX5, RBFOX3, SAT2, and NGFRAP1. Some genes (e.g., CNTNAP2, GABRG2, GABRB1) are upregulated. These neurons are highly enriched for ASD genetic risk factors (SFARI genes), and their transcriptomic changes are most strongly correlated with clinical severity (as measured by ADI-R scores). <keyFinding priority='1'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **L4 Excitatory Neurons:** Also show significant DEG burden, with similar patterns of synaptic gene dysregulation (e.g., NRXN1, SOX5, GABRB1, CDH2, THY1, AHI1, ARID1B). These neurons are also enriched for ASD risk genes, though to a lesser extent than L2/3. <keyFinding priority='2'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **L5/6-CC (Cortico-cortical) Projection Neurons:** Deep-layer cortico-cortical projection neurons are recurrently affected in individual ASD patients, but L5/6 corticofugal projection neurons are not, indicating specificity for cortico-cortical circuits. <keyFinding priority='2'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **Homeostatic Subpopulations:** The study does not explicitly define homeostatic versus disease-associated subtypes within excitatory neurons, but the clustering and DEG analysis suggest that the observed changes are not due to shifts in cell type proportions but rather to altered molecular states within these subtypes.

**Differential Gene Expression & Pathways:**
- The majority of DEGs in excitatory neurons are downregulated and are involved in synaptic transmission, axon guidance, neuronal migration, and GABAergic signaling. Gene ontology (GO) analysis highlights chemical synaptic transmission, regulation of postsynaptic membrane potential, and neuron migration as top dysregulated pathways. <keyFinding priority='1'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

- Region-specific analysis (PFC vs. ACC) reveals that some DEGs are regionally enriched, but the overall pattern of upper-layer excitatory neuron vulnerability is consistent across regions.

**Modulators & Metrics:**
- The study controls for age, sex, RNA integrity, and postmortem interval. Epilepsy comorbidity is addressed by including epilepsy-only samples, revealing that ASD-specific changes in excitatory neurons are not explained by seizure history. <keyFinding priority='2'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- Whole-exome sequencing in a subset of patients links rare deleterious variants to reduced expression of corresponding genes in excitatory neurons, suggesting a genetic contribution to the observed transcriptomic changes. <keyFinding priority='2'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**
- The study is cross-sectional, but the authors note that the affected genes and pathways in upper-layer excitatory neurons are also implicated in fetal cortical development, suggesting that early developmental disturbances may persist into postnatal life. <keyFinding priority='2'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell-Cell Communication & Spatial Analysis:**
- While the main focus is on transcriptomic changes, the study validates cell type identities and marker expression using in situ hybridization. There is no direct spatial transcriptomics or ligand-receptor analysis, but the convergence of changes on cortico-cortical projection neurons implies circuit-level vulnerability.

**Clinical Correlation:**
- The magnitude of gene expression changes in L2/3 excitatory neurons is the strongest predictor of clinical severity (ADI-R scores) among all cell types analyzed. Hierarchical clustering of ASD patients based on L2/3 neuron DEGs stratifies individuals by clinical severity, independent of epilepsy status. <keyFinding priority='1'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

The study provides strong evidence that upper-layer (L2/3) and layer 4 excitatory neurons, specifically cortico-cortical projection neuron subtypes, are the principal cellular substrates of ASD-associated molecular pathology. The downregulation of synaptic and neurodevelopmental genes in these neurons is highly enriched for known ASD risk genes and correlates with clinical severity, suggesting that disruption of upper-layer cortical circuits may underlie core behavioral features of ASD. These findings nominate upper-layer excitatory neuron subtypes and their molecular signatures as potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers for ASD, though causal relationships remain to be established in longitudinal or experimental models. <keyFinding priority='1'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study highlights upper-layer (L2/3) and layer 4 excitatory neurons—particularly cortico-cortical projection subtypes—as central to ASD molecular pathology, with transcriptomic changes highly enriched for ASD risk genes and predictive of clinical severity. The findings align with prior developmental transcriptomic studies implicating upper-layer projection neurons in ASD, but extend these observations to the mature human cortex and provide cell type–specific resolution. Open questions include whether the observed transcriptomic changes reflect primary developmental disturbances or ongoing disease processes, and how these molecular alterations translate to circuit dysfunction and behavioral phenotypes. The lack of homeostatic versus disease-associated subtype distinction within excitatory neurons suggests a need for finer-grained subclustering or trajectory analysis in future work. Integration with spatial transcriptomics, functional assays, and longitudinal studies will be critical to establish causality and therapeutic relevance. No explicit contradictions with prior models are discussed; rather, the results reinforce and refine the concept of upper-layer excitatory neuron vulnerability in ASD. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Disease focus: Parkinson’s disease (PD)
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on postmortem human substantia nigra (SN) from 23 idiopathic PD and 9 control donors (average age 81). 315,867 high-quality nuclei were analyzed using Seurat/Harmony-based clustering. Validation included immunohistochemistry (IHC), RNAscope in situ hybridization, and comparison with human midbrain organoids and mouse SN.
</methods>

---

**Quick Reference**

A unique RIT2-enriched excitatory neuron subtype (cluster c9), distinct from canonical dopaminergic neurons, was identified in the human substantia nigra and found to be selectively vulnerable in Parkinson’s disease, with its abundance markedly reduced in PD. This subtype expresses RIT2 (a PD risk gene) and includes both TH+ and TH− cells, with reduced RIT2 expression in PD. The vulnerability of this subtype is independent of age and sex, and its loss is validated in human, mouse, and organoid models. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>

---

**Detailed Summary**

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Identification**

The study identified three main neuron clusters in the human SN: c6, c7, and c9. All three clusters contain excitatory neurons, but c9 is uniquely marked by high RIT2 expression—a gene previously implicated in PD risk. The c9 cluster is significantly depleted in PD samples compared to controls (mean 3% in controls vs. 0.6% in PD; odds ratio = 6.6, P = 0.0073), a finding robust to outlier removal and validated by IHC in independent cohorts. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Subtype Characterization**

- **c9 (RIT2-enriched excitatory neurons):**
  - **Defining markers:** RIT2 (up), CADPS2 (up), RBFOX3 (up); a subset expresses TH (tyrosine hydroxylase, canonical DA marker), but many are TH−.
  - **Functional signature:** Transcriptomically distinct from canonical DA neurons; includes both RIT2+TH+ and RIT2+TH− subpopulations. Many c9 neurons are neuromelanin-positive (NM+), and both NM+ and NM− RIT2+ neurons are reduced in PD.
  - **Disease association:** Markedly reduced in PD, with both RIT2+TH+ and RIT2+TH− subtypes affected. RIT2 expression is significantly downregulated in c9 neurons in PD (0.8-fold, adj. P = 0.047).
  - **Spatial/morphological validation:** IHC and RNAscope confirm RIT2+ neurons in human and mouse SN, with similar spatial distribution; also validated in human midbrain organoids.
  - **Trajectory:** The loss of c9 neurons is observed at advanced Braak stages, suggesting late-stage vulnerability.

- **c6_2 and c7_3 (canonical DA neuron subtypes):**
  - **Defining markers:** High TH, SLC18A2, SLC6A3; c6_2 also expresses SOX6 (22.25% of cells), c7_3 expresses lower SOX6 (6.22%).
  - **Functional signature:** Typical DA neurons; both subtypes are also reduced in PD (c6_2: OR = 3.7, P = 0.00096; c7_3: OR = 5.9, P = 0.0041).
  - **Disease association:** Downregulation of DA neuron markers (TH, SLC18A2, SLC6A3, ALDH1A1) in c7_3 in PD; c6_2 shows fewer DEGs.
  - **Trajectory:** Both subtypes show early and sustained downregulation of DA neurogenesis and synaptic homeostasis genes in PD.

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathways**

- c9 neurons have the highest number of DEGs in PD (1203), with prominent downregulation of synaptic protein interaction genes and upregulation of ribosomal and protein translation pathways.
- Metallothionein family genes (MT2A, MT1E, MT3) and heat shock proteins (HSPB1, HSPH1, HSPA1, HSP90AA1) are upregulated across neuronal and non-neuronal clusters in PD.
- Pathway analysis reveals upregulation of translation and stress response pathways, and downregulation of synaptic transmission in c9 and c7_3.
- RIT2, a PD GWAS risk gene, is specifically downregulated in c9 in PD.

**Genetic and Host Modulators**

- No significant modulation by age or sex is reported for c9 vulnerability.
- RIT2 is a known PD risk gene; its reduced expression in c9 neurons is implicated in PD pathogenesis.
- Other PD GWAS genes (e.g., SV2C, KTN1) show cell-type-specific expression and deregulation, but c9 is most strongly associated with RIT2.

**Cell-Cell Communication**

- c9 neurons show a global decrease in both incoming and outgoing ligand-receptor interactions in PD, indicating disrupted network integration.
- Loss of cadherin (CDH) and ephrin (EPHA/EPHB) signaling pathways in c9 and other neuron clusters in PD, which may contribute to neuronal dysfunction.

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**

- RIT2+ neurons are spatially concentrated in the SN, validated by IHC and RNAscope in human and mouse, and by immunostaining in midbrain organoids.
- Both RIT2+TH+ and RIT2+TH− neurons are present in NM+ and NM− populations.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**

- Early and sustained downregulation of synaptic and DA neurogenesis genes in c9 and c7_3 across Braak stages.
- Translation and chaperone activity pathways are activated at late stages in vulnerable neuron subtypes.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
The identification of a RIT2-enriched excitatory neuron subtype (c9) that is selectively vulnerable in PD expands the spectrum of neuronal populations implicated in disease pathogenesis beyond canonical DA neurons. The strong association of c9 loss and RIT2 downregulation with PD suggests a potential mechanistic link between genetic risk and selective neuronal vulnerability. These findings highlight RIT2+ neurons as candidate targets for biomarker development and therapeutic intervention, though causality remains to be established. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications**

This study provides compelling evidence for the existence of a previously uncharacterized RIT2-enriched excitatory neuron subtype in the human SN that is highly vulnerable in PD. The findings align with, but extend beyond, prior models focused solely on DA neuron loss by implicating a broader spectrum of excitatory neuron subtypes. The explicit link between RIT2 expression, genetic risk, and neuronal vulnerability is novel and robustly validated across species and model systems. Open questions remain regarding the developmental origin, physiological function, and precise role of RIT2+TH− neurons in SN circuitry and PD symptomatology. The study’s classification of excitatory neuron subtypes is consistent with emerging single-cell atlases, but the specific vulnerability of RIT2+ neurons represents a significant advance. No explicit contradictions with prior data are discussed by the authors. Future work should address the causal mechanisms underlying RIT2 downregulation, the potential for early-stage intervention, and the relevance of these findings to sporadic versus familial PD.

Single-nucleus multiome (paired snRNA-seq and snATAC-seq) was performed on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA9) from 26 postmortem brains (19 C9orf72 ALS/FTD, 7 controls). Donors were stratified by cortical phosphorylated TDP-43 (pTDP-43) levels (TDPneg, TDPmed, TDPhigh).

**Quick Reference**

<keyFinding priority='1'>C9orf72 ALS/FTD is marked by a pronounced and progressive loss of CUX2/LAMP5+ layer 2/3 cortical projection excitatory neurons, with this depletion evident even at early disease stages and worsening as pTDP-43 accumulates.

The CUX2/LAMP5+ subtype is especially depleted in TDPhigh (late-stage) cases.</keyFinding> Major gene expression changes in excitatory neurons are associated with pTDP-43 burden, with NEAT1 and PLCL1 upregulated in late-stage disease.

---

**Detailed Summary**

<findings>
The study provides a comprehensive single-nucleus multiomic analysis of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in C9orf72 ALS/FTD, focusing on cell-type and disease-stage-specific molecular alterations. Excitatory neurons (EX) were systematically subclustered, revealing nine distinct subtypes in the primary (Emory) cohort, with annotation based on cortical layer and projection identity.

**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Vulnerability**

<keyFinding priority='1'>
A striking and early reduction in the proportion of CUX2/LAMP5+ layer 2/3 cortical projection excitatory neurons (EX-1) was observed in both TDPneg (early) and TDPhigh (late) C9orf72 ALS/FTD groups compared to controls. This depletion is more severe in TDPhigh cases, indicating progressive vulnerability as pTDP-43 accumulates. Quantitatively, the proportion of these neurons is over threefold lower in both TDPneg and TDPhigh groups relative to controls, with the most pronounced loss in TDPhigh.
</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Immunofluorescence confirmed the loss of CUX2+ neurons in upper cortical layers of TDPhigh samples, supporting the snRNA-seq findings.

Other excitatory neuron subtypes (e.g., subcortical projection neurons) and inhibitory neurons showed less pronounced or more variable changes, with some inhibitory subtypes (from medial caudal ganglionic eminence) relatively increased in TDPhigh, suggesting subtype-specific resistance.

**Subtype Characterization**

- **EX-1 (CUX2/LAMP5+ Layer 2/3 Cortical Projection Neurons):**
  - **Defining markers:** CUX2, LAMP5 (high), ITGAM, ITGB2 (complement receptor subunits).
  - **Functional signature:** Projection neurons of upper cortical layers, implicated in long-range cortical connectivity.
  - **Disease association:** Selectively and progressively depleted in C9orf72 ALS/FTD, especially with high pTDP-43. These neurons are the major contributors to the TDP-43-negative neuronal transcriptome, indicating high susceptibility to nuclear TDP-43 loss.
  - **Potential mechanism:** High expression of complement receptor subunits (ITGAM/ITGB2) suggests these neurons may be preferentially targeted for microglial-mediated synaptic pruning, especially as microglial C3 is upregulated early in disease.
  - **Spatial validation:** Loss confirmed by CUX2 immunostaining in upper cortical layers.

- **Other Excitatory Neuron Subtypes (e.g., subcortical projection neurons):**
  - **Defining markers:** Layer- and projection-specific markers (not detailed for all subtypes).
  - **Disease association:** Some subtypes show changes in proportion, but none as dramatic or consistent as EX-1.

**Gene Expression and Pathway Changes**

- **Differential Gene Expression:**
  - Excitatory neurons in TDPhigh samples show upregulation of NEAT1 (long noncoding RNA involved in paraspeckle formation) and PLCL1 (phospholipase C-like 1, involved in GABA receptor trafficking).
  - Downregulation of CAMK2A (calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II alpha) is observed in late-stage disease, a gene previously shown to be affected by TDP-43 loss.
  - Early-stage (TDPneg) neurons upregulate SPTAN1 (spectrin alpha, cytoskeletal protein), suggesting cytoskeletal remodeling.

- **Pathway Enrichment:**
  - Late-stage (TDPhigh) excitatory neurons show enrichment for GABAergic signaling and paraspeckle/NEAT1-related pathways.
  - Early-stage changes involve calmodulin binding and cytoskeletal organization.

- **Gene Regulatory Networks:**
  - WGCNA identified two modules (ME1, ME4) strongly correlated with pTDP-43 levels. ME4 (positively correlated with pTDP-43) is enriched for GABA signaling and includes NEAT1 and PLCL1 as hub genes. ME1 (negatively correlated) is enriched for calmodulin binding and includes SPTAN1 and CAMK2A.

**Disease Progression and Trajectories**

- The loss of CUX2/LAMP5+ excitatory neurons is evident even before substantial pTDP-43 accumulation (TDPneg), suggesting early vulnerability, possibly due to microglial complement activation.
- Transcriptomic changes in excitatory neurons evolve with disease stage: early cytoskeletal and synaptic changes give way to late-stage alterations in RNA metabolism (NEAT1) and inhibitory signaling (PLCL1).

**Modulators & Metrics**

- No significant effect of sex or age was reported for excitatory neuron vulnerability.
- The study did not find significant changes in C9orf72 expression in excitatory neurons between groups.
- The selective vulnerability of CUX2/LAMP5+ neurons may be modulated by their complement receptor expression, making them targets for microglial C3-mediated pruning.

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**

- Immunostaining confirmed the selective loss of CUX2+ neurons in upper cortical layers in TDPhigh samples.
- Deconvolution with published TDP-43-sorted neuronal transcriptomes showed that EX-1 neurons are the predominant contributors to the TDP-43-negative population.

<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
The study implicates selective and progressive loss of CUX2/LAMP5+ layer 2/3 cortical projection excitatory neurons as a hallmark of C9orf72 ALS/FTD, with this loss occurring early and worsening with pTDP-43 accumulation. The vulnerability of these neurons may be mediated by complement receptor expression and microglial activation, suggesting a mechanism for early synaptic and neuronal loss. Upregulation of NEAT1 and PLCL1 in late-stage disease points to altered RNA metabolism and inhibitory signaling as additional contributors to neuronal dysfunction. These findings highlight potential therapeutic targets in complement signaling and paraspeckle/NEAT1 pathways, and suggest that CUX2/LAMP5+ neuron loss could serve as a biomarker for disease progression.
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications**

This study provides strong evidence that CUX2/LAMP5+ layer 2/3 cortical projection excitatory neurons are selectively and progressively lost in C9orf72 ALS/FTD, with depletion detectable even before overt pTDP-43 pathology. The alignment of these findings with prior knowledge of upper-layer neuron vulnerability in FTD is reinforced by the explicit demonstration of complement receptor expression and microglial activation as potential mediators. The upregulation of NEAT1 and PLCL1 in late-stage disease suggests convergence with mechanisms implicated in other neurodegenerative disorders, such as altered RNA metabolism and inhibitory signaling. Open questions include whether similar patterns are observed in sporadic ALS/FTD or other genetic subtypes, and whether interventions targeting complement signaling or paraspeckle dynamics can mitigate excitatory neuron loss. The study does not report contradictions with prior models but extends them by providing cell-type and stage-specific resolution. Future work should address the causal relationship between microglial activation, complement signaling, and excitatory neuron loss, and explore the therapeutic potential of modulating these pathways.

# summary for Yang 2021 (excitatory neurons)

1) **Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This study (Yang et al., 2021, Nature) used single-nucleus RNA-seq of human frontal cortex and choroid plexus to profile cellular changes in severe COVID-19. Excitatory neurons, especially upper-layer (L2/3) subtypes, exhibited pronounced downregulation of synaptic genes (e.g., VAMP2, SNAP25, ATP6V0C), suggesting impaired neurotransmission. These transcriptional changes were most prominent in L2/3 excitatory neurons, which are evolutionarily expanded in humans and linked to cognition. No direct viral RNA was detected in neurons, indicating changes are likely secondary to neuroinflammation. Age was matched between groups, and no major genetic drivers were identified for excitatory neuron vulnerability.

Disease focus: Severe COVID-19 (neurological sequelae).
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on post-mortem medial frontal cortex and choroid plexus from 8 COVID-19 patients and 14 controls (including 1 influenza case). The study captured 65,309 nuclei (38,217 cortex, 27,092 choroid plexus), with a median of ~1,900 genes per nucleus. Cell type annotations were based on established marker genes, and differential expression was analyzed using MAST. Validation included RT-qPCR and immunohistochemistry for selected targets. No SARS-CoV-2 RNA or protein was detected in brain tissue by multiple assays.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Excitatory neurons comprised a substantial fraction of cortical nuclei, with no significant loss in overall proportion between COVID-19 and control groups (<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>). However, the study did not report major shifts in the abundance of excitatory neuron subtypes, focusing instead on transcriptional changes.

**Differential Gene Expression:**  
The most striking finding for excitatory neurons was a robust downregulation of genes involved in synaptic vesicle cycling and neurotransmission, particularly in upper-layer (L2/3) excitatory neurons. Key downregulated genes included VAMP2, SNAP25, and ATP6V0C (<keyFinding priority='1'>Downregulation of synaptic vesicle and neurotransmission genes in L2/3 excitatory neurons in COVID-19</keyFinding>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>). The magnitude of downregulation was most pronounced in L2/3 neurons, with a lesser effect in L4 and L5/6 subtypes.

**Pathway Enrichment:**  
Pathway analysis revealed significant enrichment for terms related to synaptic signaling, regulated exocytosis, and trans-synaptic communication among downregulated genes in excitatory neurons (<keyFinding priority='2'>Impaired synaptic signaling pathways in upper-layer excitatory neurons</keyFinding>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>). These changes were not observed to the same extent in inhibitory neurons or glia.

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
The study identified several excitatory neuron subtypes based on cortical layer markers:
- **L2/3 excitatory neurons:** Defined by markers such as CUX2 and RORB, these neurons showed the strongest COVID-19-associated transcriptional changes. Downregulated genes included VAMP2, SNAP25, ATP6V0C, and others involved in synaptic vesicle docking and neurotransmitter release. These neurons are cortico-cortical projecting and are implicated in associative learning and cognition (<keyFinding priority='1'>L2/3 excitatory neurons are selectively vulnerable to synaptic gene downregulation in COVID-19</keyFinding>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).
- **L4 excitatory neurons:** Also showed downregulation of synaptic genes, but to a lesser extent.
- **L5/6 excitatory neurons:** Minimal changes in synaptic gene expression compared to upper layers.
- **Other subtypes (e.g., NRGN neuron):** Not specifically highlighted for COVID-19-related changes.

No evidence was found for the emergence of novel excitatory neuron subpopulations or for a shift toward a disease-associated excitatory neuron state. The main alteration was a loss of homeostatic synaptic gene expression in existing subtypes.

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
No major demographic (age, sex) or genetic (APOE, GWAS risk variants) drivers were identified for excitatory neuron vulnerability in this dataset. Age was matched between groups, and the study did not report genotype-specific effects on excitatory neuron transcriptional changes.

**Gene Regulatory Networks:**  
The study did not identify specific transcription factors or gene regulatory networks driving the observed downregulation in excitatory neurons.

**Cell-Cell Communication:**  
Cell-cell communication analysis (CellChat) predicted increased inflammatory signaling from choroid plexus and glial cells to upper-layer excitatory neurons, particularly via chemokine (CXCL, CCL) and complement pathways. This suggests that excitatory neuron dysfunction may be secondary to neuroinflammation rather than direct viral infection (<keyFinding priority='2'>Inflammatory relay from choroid plexus/glia to excitatory neurons</keyFinding>, <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Spatial Analysis:**  
No spatial transcriptomics or in situ hybridization was performed for excitatory neuron markers, but immunohistochemistry validated glial activation in adjacent tissue.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
No pseudotime or trajectory analysis was performed specifically for excitatory neurons. The study did not report evidence for progressive loss or transformation of excitatory neuron subtypes.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
Overlap analysis showed that COVID-19-associated DEGs in excitatory neurons were enriched for loci implicated in cognition, schizophrenia, and depression in GWAS datasets (<keyFinding priority='2'>COVID-19 DEGs in excitatory neurons overlap with neuropsychiatric risk loci</keyFinding>, <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

</findings>

<clinical>
Excitatory neuron dysfunction, particularly in upper-layer (L2/3) subtypes, may contribute to the cognitive symptoms ("brain fog," impaired concentration) reported in COVID-19 and long COVID (<keyFinding priority='1'>L2/3 excitatory neuron synaptic dysfunction may underlie cognitive symptoms in COVID-19</keyFinding>, <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>). The observed transcriptional changes are similar to those seen in chronic neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders, suggesting a convergent pathway of synaptic impairment. However, as the changes are associative and not linked to direct viral infection, they likely reflect secondary effects of neuroinflammation. No immediate therapeutic or biomarker implications are proposed, but the findings highlight the vulnerability of human-specific cortical circuits in systemic inflammatory states.
</clinical>

---

3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study provides strong evidence that upper-layer (L2/3) excitatory neurons in the human frontal cortex are selectively vulnerable to synaptic gene downregulation in severe COVID-19, likely as a consequence of neuroinflammatory signaling rather than direct viral infection. The overlap of COVID-19-induced transcriptional changes with GWAS loci for cognition and psychiatric disorders suggests that systemic inflammation may unmask or exacerbate latent vulnerabilities in these circuits. Open questions include whether these changes are reversible, how long they persist after acute illness, and whether similar patterns are seen in milder or long COVID cases. The study's findings align with prior reports of upper-layer neuron involvement in neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative disorders, but the authors do not report any explicit contradictions with existing models. Future work should address the temporal dynamics of excitatory neuron dysfunction, potential for recovery, and the role of host genetics in modulating susceptibility. Integration with spatial transcriptomics and functional assays will be important to validate and extend these findings.

Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on 143,793 nuclei from post-mortem human hippocampus and superior frontal cortex samples (n=25 samples from 17 individuals: 9 AD, 8 no cognitive impairment [NCI]). The VINE-seq protocol was developed to enrich for vascular and perivascular nuclei, but all major brain cell types were captured. Immunohistochemistry and in situ validation were used for key marker genes and cell type assignments.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and General Features**  
Excitatory neurons were among the major cell types identified in the dataset, but the VINE-seq protocol was optimized for vascular enrichment, resulting in a lower yield of neuronal nuclei compared to glial and vascular populations. Excitatory neurons comprised a minority of the total nuclei captured (see Extended Data Fig. 1d–g, Fig. 1b), and their proportions did not show significant differences between AD and NCI groups or between hippocampus and cortex (<keyFinding priority='3'>Excitatory neuron proportions were stable across disease and region</keyFinding>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization**  
The study did not focus on a detailed taxonomy of excitatory neuron subtypes, as the primary aim was vascular and perivascular cell profiling. Excitatory neurons were annotated based on canonical marker genes (e.g., SLC17A7/VGLUT1, SLC17A6/VGLUT2), and separated from inhibitory neurons and glia using established markers (see Extended Data Fig. 2b–c). No further subdivision or disease-associated subtypes of excitatory neurons were reported in this dataset. The authors did not describe distinct excitatory neuron subpopulations, nor did they report differential gene expression or functional states specific to excitatory neurons in AD versus control.

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**  
No significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) or pathway enrichments were reported for excitatory neurons in AD compared to NCI. The majority of cell-type-specific transcriptomic changes in AD were observed in vascular, mural, and perivascular fibroblast-like cells, with mural cells (pericytes, SMCs) showing the strongest disease-associated signatures (<keyFinding priority='1'>Vascular and mural cells, not excitatory neurons, exhibit the most robust AD-associated transcriptomic changes</keyFinding>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>). Excitatory neurons did not feature among the cell types with notable AD-related DEGs (see Fig. 5c, Extended Data Fig. 8f).

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**  
No spatial or morphological findings specific to excitatory neurons were reported. Immunohistochemistry and in situ validation focused on vascular and glial markers.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories and Modulators**  
No evidence was presented for disease stage-specific transitions, pseudotime trajectories, or modulatory effects (e.g., APOE genotype, age, sex) on excitatory neuron subtypes or states. The study did not report any association between excitatory neuron features and AD pathology or clinical variables.

**Gene Regulatory Networks, Cell-Cell Communication, and Genetic Integration**  
No gene regulatory network analysis, ligand-receptor interaction, or GWAS integration findings were reported for excitatory neurons. The mapping of AD GWAS risk genes to cell types revealed strong enrichment in microglia, vascular, and perivascular cells, but not in excitatory neurons (<keyFinding priority='2'>AD GWAS genes are not enriched in excitatory neurons in this dataset</keyFinding>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Summary of Negative Findings**  
Overall, the study provides little evidence for excitatory neuron heterogeneity, disease-associated subtypes, or transcriptomic perturbation in AD, as captured by the VINE-seq protocol. This is explicitly reflected in the figures and supplementary data, where excitatory neurons are present but not a focus of analysis or discussion.

</findings>

<clinical>
Excitatory neurons, as captured by VINE-seq, do not show selective vulnerability, disease-associated subtypes, or transcriptomic changes in Alzheimer’s disease in this study. The lack of significant findings suggests that, within the context of this vascular-enriched dataset, excitatory neurons are not primary mediators of AD risk or pathology. The results reinforce the centrality of vascular, mural, and perivascular cells in AD mechanisms, with minimal direct implication for excitatory neuron-targeted therapies or biomarkers based on this dataset.
</clinical>

---

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**  
In this vascular-enriched single-nucleus RNA-seq atlas of the human brain, excitatory neurons were captured as a minority population and showed no significant disease-associated subtypes, differential gene expression, or pathway changes in Alzheimer’s disease. The study found that AD risk genes and transcriptomic perturbations were concentrated in vascular, mural, and perivascular cells, not in excitatory neurons. No genetic, demographic, or pathological drivers were identified for excitatory neuron states in this dataset.

---

**Research Implications (≈150 words):**  
The absence of excitatory neuron heterogeneity or AD-associated transcriptomic changes in this study highlights the limitations of vascular-enriched protocols for neuronal profiling. While the findings reinforce the primacy of vascular and glial mechanisms in AD pathogenesis, they do not preclude the existence of excitatory neuron subtypes or disease states detectable by neuron-optimized single-cell approaches. The lack of GWAS gene enrichment and transcriptomic shifts in excitatory neurons contrasts with some prior studies using parenchymal-focused protocols, suggesting that cell isolation methods and tissue processing can strongly influence cell type representation and sensitivity to neuronal pathology. Future work integrating neuron-enriched single-nucleus datasets, spatial transcriptomics, and longitudinal sampling will be required to fully resolve excitatory neuron vulnerability and heterogeneity in AD. No explicit contradictions with prior neuron-focused studies are discussed by the authors, but the limited neuronal yield is acknowledged as a technical constraint.

# summary for Zhou 2020 (excitatory neurons)

1) **Quick Reference**

Excitatory neurons in both mouse and human Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brains show minimal transcriptional changes compared to glial populations. In mouse 5XFAD models, excitatory neurons primarily downregulate Egr1, a regulator of survival and proliferation, with no evidence for distinct disease-associated subtypes. In human AD cortex, excitatory neuron clusters (Ex0, Ex1) are underrepresented, reflecting neuronal loss, and show modest downregulation of synaptic and plasticity genes. The loss of excitatory neurons is more pronounced in AD patients, especially in those with TREM2 risk variants, but no novel disease-associated excitatory neuron subtypes are reported. <keyFinding priority='2'>Excitatory neuron depletion and downregulation of synaptic genes are associated with AD pathology and TREM2 genotype.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>

<findings>
Excitatory neurons were robustly identified in both mouse and human datasets using canonical markers (e.g., Slc17a7, Satb2, Grin1 in mouse; SLC17A7, NEFM in human). In mouse, five neuronal clusters were annotated, with several corresponding to excitatory neurons. In human, two excitatory neuron clusters (Ex0, Ex1) were defined.

**Cell Type Proportions:**  
In mouse 5XFAD models, the relative abundance of excitatory neuron clusters remained largely stable across genotypes and ages, except for a specific neuronal cluster (cluster 4) in 15-month-old Trem2−/− 5XFAD cortex, which showed reduced unique molecular identifiers (UMIs) and high expression of Pam, possibly representing dystrophic neurons accumulating due to ineffective microglial control. <keyFinding priority='2'>No major loss of excitatory neuron nuclei was observed in mouse models, but a subset may become dystrophic in the absence of Trem2.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

In human AD cortex, the proportion of excitatory neuron clusters, especially Ex1 (enriched for NEFL and NEFM), was significantly reduced compared to controls, consistent with neuronal loss in AD. This reduction was more pronounced in AD samples than in controls, and was not substantially altered by TREM2 R62H status. <keyFinding priority='1'>Excitatory neuron loss is a hallmark of human AD cortex, particularly in NEFL/NEFM-enriched subtypes.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression:**  
In mouse 5XFAD models, excitatory neurons showed minimal transcriptional response to Aβ pathology. The most notable change was the downregulation of Egr1 (and to a lesser extent, Junb, Arc, Btg2, Penk, Npas4, and other immediate early genes) across several excitatory neuron clusters (clusters 0, 3, 5). The magnitude of downregulation was moderate (log2 fold change ≈ -1 to -1.5). No upregulated genes or disease-associated excitatory neuron subtypes were reported. <keyFinding priority='2'>Egr1 and other activity-dependent genes are downregulated in excitatory neurons in response to Aβ in mouse models.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

In human AD cortex, excitatory neuron clusters showed modest downregulation of genes involved in synaptic function, neurotransmission, and plasticity, including ADCYAP1, ARC, ATP6V1G2, RIMS1, and PLXNC1. These changes were validated by NanoString and proteomics, and are consistent with impaired memory and cognitive decline in AD. The fold changes were generally less than 1.5, indicating subtle but consistent effects. <keyFinding priority='1'>Downregulation of synaptic and plasticity genes in excitatory neurons is associated with cognitive impairment in human AD.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Pathway Enrichment:**  
No specific pathway enrichment was reported for excitatory neuron clusters in mouse. In human, pathway analysis of downregulated genes in neurons highlighted deficits in neurotransmitter synthesis, axon guidance, synaptic vesicle function, and plasticity.

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
No distinct disease-associated excitatory neuron subtypes or states were identified in either mouse or human datasets. In mouse, a cluster with high Pam expression and low UMI count in Trem2−/− 5XFAD cortex may represent dystrophic neurons, but this was not further characterized as a molecular subtype. In human, Ex1 (NEFL/NEFM-enriched) was particularly depleted in AD, but no novel subtypes emerged.

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
In mouse, the presence of dystrophic excitatory neurons (Pam-high, low UMI) was associated with Trem2 deficiency and advanced pathology, suggesting a link between microglial dysfunction and neuronal health. In human, the degree of excitatory neuron loss was not significantly modulated by TREM2 R62H status, though overall neuronal depletion was a robust feature of AD.

**Gene Regulatory Networks:**  
Downregulation of Egr1 and other immediate early genes in mouse suggests altered activity-dependent transcriptional regulation in excitatory neurons during Aβ pathology.

**Cell-Cell Communication:**  
No direct evidence for altered ligand-receptor interactions involving excitatory neurons was reported.

**Spatial Analysis:**  
No spatial or morphological validation specific to excitatory neuron subtypes was provided.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
In mouse, the emergence of dystrophic neurons in Trem2−/− 5XFAD cortex at 15 months suggests a late-stage effect of impaired microglial function on neuronal integrity. In human, the loss of NEFL/NEFM-enriched excitatory neurons is consistent with advanced neurodegeneration.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
NanoString and proteomic validation confirmed the downregulation of synaptic and plasticity genes in human AD cortex. No eQTL or GWAS integration specific to excitatory neuron subtypes was reported.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
Excitatory neuron loss and downregulation of synaptic/plasticity genes are strongly associated with cognitive decline and AD pathology in humans. The absence of distinct disease-associated excitatory neuron subtypes suggests that neuronal dysfunction in AD is primarily characterized by depletion and loss of function, rather than the emergence of novel molecular states. The findings highlight the importance of preserving excitatory neuron integrity and synaptic function as potential therapeutic targets, but do not identify specific biomarkers or subtypes for intervention. <keyFinding priority='1'>Excitatory neuron depletion and synaptic dysfunction are central to AD pathogenesis, with potential implications for biomarker development and neuroprotective strategies.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
</clinical>

---

3) **Research Implications**

This study demonstrates that, unlike glial populations, excitatory neurons in both mouse and human AD brains do not exhibit distinct disease-associated molecular subtypes, but rather show depletion and downregulation of activity-dependent and synaptic genes. The lack of robust transcriptional activation or emergence of novel excitatory neuron states suggests that neuronal loss and dysfunction are late or secondary events in AD, potentially downstream of glial and microglial pathology. The downregulation of genes such as Egr1 (mouse) and ADCYAP1, ARC, ATP6V1G2, RIMS1 (human) aligns with known deficits in synaptic plasticity and memory in AD, and these genes may serve as markers of neuronal health rather than disease-specific subtypes.

Open questions include whether more subtle or region-specific excitatory neuron subtypes might emerge with higher-resolution or spatial transcriptomics, and how microglial dysfunction (e.g., due to TREM2 variants) indirectly contributes to excitatory neuron degeneration. The findings are consistent with prior models emphasizing neuronal loss in AD, but do not support the existence of a "disease-associated excitatory neuron" state analogous to DAM in microglia. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Future studies should explore the temporal dynamics of excitatory neuron loss, the interplay with glial pathology, and the potential for early intervention to preserve synaptic gene expression and neuronal survival.

Quick Reference (≈100 words)

Excitatory neurons in the PD prefrontal cortex were divided into three subtypes (ExN1, ExN2, ExN3), each with distinct marker genes (e.g., CUX2/CBLN2 for ExN1, TSHZ2/POU6F2 for ExN2, NRG1/NEFL for ExN3). PD was associated with broad downregulation of protein folding/chaperone genes (notably HSP90AB1, HSPA1A, DNAJB6) in excitatory neurons, which correlated inversely with Lewy body pathology. Synaptic assembly and axonogenesis pathways were upregulated, suggesting compensatory or maladaptive synaptic changes. These neuronal changes were not observed in Alzheimer’s disease, highlighting disease-specific vulnerability. No major demographic or genetic driver was identified for excitatory neuron subtypes in this cohort.

Detailed Summary (≈800–1000 words)
---
<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Identification**
Excitatory neurons (ExN) were one of eight major cell types identified in the prefrontal cortex, with three transcriptionally distinct subclusters: ExN1, ExN2, and ExN3. The relative proportion of excitatory neurons did not differ significantly between PD and controls, indicating that transcriptional rather than numerical changes predominate in this cell type in late-stage PD.

**Subtype Characterization**
- **ExN1**: Defined by high expression of CUX2, CBLN2, and HS6ST3. These markers suggest upper-layer cortical projection neuron identity.
- **ExN2**: Characterized by TSHZ2, POU6F2, and FOXP2, consistent with deep-layer projection neurons.
- **ExN3**: Marked by NRG1, NEFL, and CADPS2, indicating a distinct excitatory neuron population, possibly with unique connectivity or vulnerability.

Each subtype maintained its marker gene expression in both PD and control brains, but all showed a broad signature of gene repression in PD, with 79% of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) being downregulated. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathways**
The most prominent transcriptional change in excitatory neurons was the downregulation of genes involved in protein folding and the unfolded protein response, including HSPB1, HSP90AB1, DNAJB6, HSPA1A, and HSPH1. This pattern was validated by RNAscope in situ hybridization for selected genes (e.g., HSP90AA1). <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that upregulated pathways in excitatory neurons included axonogenesis (EPHA6, ROBO1, GAB1, PARD3) and presynaptic assembly (NLGN4Y, CBLN2), suggesting compensatory synaptogenesis or synaptic remodeling. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Disease Association and Pathology Correlation**
Lewy body pathology, assessed by phospho-S129 α-synuclein immunohistochemistry, was significantly higher in PD brains and largely restricted to excitatory neurons. Quantitative analysis showed a strong inverse correlation between Lewy body pathology scores and the expression of chaperone genes in excitatory neurons (e.g., HSP90AB1 R²=0.74, HSPA1A R²=0.61, DNAJA4 R²=0.58). This suggests that reduced chaperone capacity may contribute to α-synuclein aggregation in these neurons. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Subtype-Specific Vulnerability and Dynamics**
RNA velocity analysis indicated altered transcriptional trajectories in all excitatory neuron subtypes in PD, especially ExN2 and ExN3, which shifted dramatically compared to controls. This suggests that these subpopulations may be particularly vulnerable or undergo disease-associated state transitions. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Genetic and Multi-omic Integration**
Expression of several familial PD genes (e.g., PRKN, PINK1, GBA, PARK7) was downregulated in excitatory neurons in PD, consistent with a loss-of-function effect. UTMOST transcriptome-wide association analysis identified additional PD risk genes (e.g., LRRC37A2, BCL7C, RNF40) that were also downregulated in excitatory neurons. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell-Cell Communication**
CellPhoneDB analysis revealed a marked loss (~25%) of neuron-astrocyte interactions in PD, particularly involving EGFR, ACVR, and TYRO3 signaling, which may further compromise excitatory neuron support and homeostasis. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Comparison with Alzheimer’s Disease**
Direct comparison with a published AD prefrontal cortex snRNA-seq dataset showed no overlap in differentially expressed genes in excitatory neurons between PD and AD, indicating disease-specific neuronal vulnerability. Shared transcriptional changes were restricted to glial cells. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Proteomic Validation**
Proteomic analysis of the same tissue confirmed downregulation of synaptic proteins and upregulation of glutathione metabolism pathways, supporting the transcriptomic findings of synaptic and oxidative stress responses in excitatory neurons. <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
Excitatory neurons in the PD prefrontal cortex exhibit a unique pattern of vulnerability characterized by reduced chaperone capacity and increased Lewy body pathology. The strong inverse correlation between chaperone gene expression and α-synuclein aggregation suggests that impaired proteostasis may be a key driver of neuronal dysfunction and degeneration in PD. Upregulation of synaptic assembly pathways may reflect compensatory or maladaptive responses to ongoing synaptic loss. The lack of overlap with AD neuronal signatures highlights the disease specificity of these changes. These findings suggest that restoring chaperone function or targeting synaptic remodeling could be therapeutic strategies for PD, but causal relationships remain to be established. <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>
</clinical>

Research Implications (≈100–200 words)
---
This study provides a high-resolution map of excitatory neuron subtypes and their disease-associated transcriptional changes in the PD prefrontal cortex. The identification of three distinct excitatory neuron subtypes, each with unique marker genes and differential vulnerability, sets the stage for future work to dissect subtype-specific mechanisms of degeneration. The strong association between reduced chaperone gene expression and Lewy body pathology in excitatory neurons suggests that interventions aimed at boosting proteostasis may be beneficial, but longitudinal or experimental studies are needed to clarify causality. The lack of shared neuronal signatures between PD and AD underscores the importance of disease-specific approaches to neuroprotection. Open questions include the precise functional roles of each excitatory neuron subtype in PD progression, the triggers for chaperone downregulation, and whether similar patterns are observed in other affected brain regions or earlier disease stages. The study’s findings align with, but also extend, prior models of selective neuronal vulnerability by integrating multi-omic and spatial validation data. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Key findings are validated by immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation in wild-type and 5×FAD mice.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Identification**  
The authors performed high-resolution clustering of 911,548 single cells, identifying 19 major cell types, including excitatory neurons (ExNeu). Within ExNeu, 16 subpopulations were defined based on marker gene expression and mitochondrial gene dysregulation. The most prominent disease-associated subtype is ExNeu_PRKN_VIRMA, marked by high co-expression of PRKN (parkin) and VIRMA (an m6A methyltransferase component). <keyFinding priority='1'>This subtype is significantly increased in AD brains compared to controls, as shown by both scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Defining Markers and Functional Signature**  
ExNeu_PRKN_VIRMA is defined by upregulation of PRKN and VIRMA, with additional markers such as NRGN. This subtype is enriched for pathways related to mitochondrial function, mitophagy, necroptosis, apoptosis, and cellular senescence. <keyFinding priority='1'>Pathway analysis reveals suppression of mitophagy in ExNeu_PRKN_VIRMA, with downregulation of key mitophagy genes and upregulation of cell death pathways.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Disease Progression and Trajectory**  
Pseudotime analysis places ExNeu_PRKN_VIRMA at the terminal end of the excitatory neuron trajectory in AD, suggesting it represents a late-stage, disease-associated state. The proportion of ExNeu_PRKN_VIRMA increases with disease progression, while homeostatic subtypes (e.g., ExNeu_MEG3) decrease. <keyFinding priority='2'>This trajectory is supported by both human and mouse data, and the abundance of ExNeu_PRKN_VIRMA correlates with disease stage.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**  
ExNeu_PRKN_VIRMA shows significant dysregulation of mitochondrial genes (e.g., MT-CO1, MT-CO2, MT-ND1, MT-ND2), and pathway enrichment for mitophagy, apoptosis, and neurodegeneration. <keyFinding priority='2'>Mitophagy is suppressed in this subtype, as evidenced by downregulation of mitophagy pathway genes and functional annotation.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell-Cell Communication and Modulators**  
A key mechanistic insight is the identification of microglial Mic_PTPRG, a subpopulation expressing PTPRG, which increases in AD and communicates with ExNeu_PRKN_VIRMA via the PTPRG–CNTN4 axis. <keyFinding priority='1'>PTPRG protein from microglia is proposed to bind and upregulate neuronal VIRMA, leading to increased m6A methylation of PRKN mRNA, reduced PRKN translation, and impaired mitophagy.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> This mechanism is supported by molecular docking, immunoprecipitation, and spatial co-localization.

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**  
Spatial transcriptomics confirm the localization and increased abundance of ExNeu_PRKN_VIRMA in AD mouse brains. Immunofluorescence in 5×FAD mice shows upregulation of PARKIN and VIRMA in hippocampal neurons, and increased PTPRG in microglia. Immunoprecipitation demonstrates physical interaction between PTPRG and VIRMA in brain lysates, stronger in AD mice. <keyFinding priority='1'>These findings provide multi-modal validation of the proposed microglia–neuron signaling axis.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Gene Regulatory Networks and Aging/Disease Trajectories**  
The study suggests that the ExNeu_PRKN_VIRMA state emerges as a late-stage, disease-associated fate in excitatory neurons, with a strong correlation to the InNeu_PRKN_VIRMA inhibitory neuron subtype. Both subtypes show parallel increases in AD and are linked to impaired mitophagy and neuronal death.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**  
No direct GWAS or eQTL integration is reported for ExNeu_PRKN_VIRMA, but the study highlights the importance of post-transcriptional regulation (m6A methylation) in modulating PRKN expression and neuronal fate in AD.
</findings>

<clinical>
The ExNeu_PRKN_VIRMA excitatory neuron subtype is strongly associated with AD progression and neuronal death, likely due to impaired mitophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction. The microglia–neuron PTPRG–VIRMA–PRKN axis may represent a novel mechanism by which neuroinflammation and epitranscriptomic regulation converge to drive excitatory neuron vulnerability in AD. <keyFinding priority='1'>Targeting this pathway could offer new therapeutic strategies to restore mitophagy and prevent neuronal loss in AD.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> However, causality remains to be fully established, and findings are primarily associative, supported by spatial and molecular validation.
</clinical>

3) **Research Implications**

This study provides a detailed single-cell and spatial atlas of excitatory neuron heterogeneity in AD, identifying ExNeu_PRKN_VIRMA as a key disease-associated subtype with suppressed mitophagy and mitochondrial dysfunction. The findings align with emerging models of neuronal vulnerability driven by impaired organelle quality control and microglial signaling, but introduce a novel epitranscriptomic mechanism involving PTPRG-mediated upregulation of VIRMA and m6A modification of PRKN mRNA. <keyFinding priority='1'>The direct interaction between microglial PTPRG and neuronal VIRMA is a major advance, supported by multi-modal validation.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Open questions include whether ExNeu_PRKN_VIRMA is a terminal or reversible state, the precise temporal sequence of microglial–neuronal signaling, and the potential for targeting m6A methylation or PTPRG–VIRMA interactions therapeutically. The ExNeu_PRKN_VIRMA subtype does not directly map onto previously described excitatory neuron states in AD, representing a novel classification. No explicit conflicts with prior models are discussed by the authors. Future work should address causality, reversibility, and the broader relevance of this pathway across neurodegenerative conditions.
