Disease focus: Parkinson’s disease (PD), aging
</metadata>

<methods>
Paired single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) and ATAC-seq (chromatin accessibility) were performed on postmortem human substantia nigra from young (mean 24y), aged (mean 75y), and PD (mean 81y) donors. Multiomic analysis enabled joint profiling of gene expression and chromatin accessibility in the same nuclei. Cell type annotation, pseudotime/disease trajectory modeling, and peak–gene association analyses were performed. Validation included RNA-FISH on human tissue.

**Quick Reference**

This study reveals that microglia in the human midbrain undergo significant transcriptional changes with aging and further alterations in Parkinson’s disease (PD), as shown by single-nucleus multiomic profiling. Distinct microglial subpopulations—including homeostatic, aging, and a small TREM2-independent disease-associated state—were identified, with their proportions and gene expression signatures shifting along an age-to-disease trajectory. The microglial pseudopathogenesis trajectory is strongly modulated by age and PD status, with increased immune activation and loss of homeostatic features.

**Detailed Summary**

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and General Trends**

Microglia (MG) constitute the second most abundant glial population in the human substantia nigra, after oligodendrocytes. Quantitative analysis revealed a statistically significant increase in microglial proportion from young to aged (P=0.007) and from aged to PD (P=0.042) (<keyFinding priority='2'>), suggesting both aging and PD are associated with microgliosis or increased microglial representation in this region. <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Microglial Subtype Identification and Characterization**

Re-clustering and trajectory analysis of microglia identified several subpopulations:
- **Homeostatic Microglia**: Characterized by high expression of canonical markers such as P2RY12, HEXB, CST3, CX3CR1, CTSD, CSF1R, CTSS, SPARC, TMSB4X, C1QA, and C1QB. These cells predominate in young donors and are progressively reduced with aging and PD. <keyFinding priority='2'> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **Aging Microglia**: Defined by increased expression of genes such as IL15, CLEC2B, and DOCK5, which are associated with age-related microglial activation and immune signaling. This population expands with age and is further increased in PD. <keyFinding priority='2'> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **Stage 1 Disease-Associated Microglia (DAM, TREM2-independent)**: A small but distinct cluster expressing TYROBP, CTSB, APOE, B2M, and FTH1, but lacking strong TREM2 upregulation. This state is more prominent in PD, consistent with a disease-associated activation profile. <keyFinding priority='1'> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

No clear evidence for a robust TREM2-dependent DAM population was found in this midbrain dataset, in contrast to some Alzheimer’s disease studies. <contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag> (The authors note this difference and attribute it to disease context and brain region.)

**Pseudopathogenesis Trajectory and Disease Progression**

A combined pseudopathogenesis (cPP) trajectory, integrating both transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility data, was constructed for microglia. This trajectory revealed a significant, stepwise increase in cPP scores from young to aged to PD samples (P for Y/A = 1.71×10⁻⁸, Y/P = 1.71×10⁻⁸, A/P = 1.71×10⁻⁸), indicating progressive molecular changes in microglia along the aging-to-disease axis. <keyFinding priority='1'> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**

Genes upregulated along the microglial cPP trajectory (n=894) were enriched for pathways related to immune activation, cytokine-mediated signaling, and chemotaxis, while downregulated genes (n=254) were associated with cell adhesion and homeostatic functions. This suggests a shift from a surveillant/homeostatic state toward a more reactive, pro-inflammatory phenotype with aging and PD. <keyFinding priority='1'> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Gene Module Analysis**

Module scoring confirmed a decrease in homeostatic microglial gene signatures and an increase in both aging and stage 1 DAM signatures along the cPP trajectory. This was visualized as a loss of homeostatic features and a gain of disease/aging-associated activation in microglia as individuals progress from young to aged to PD. <keyFinding priority='1'> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Chromatin Accessibility and Peak–Gene Associations**

Despite robust transcriptional changes, chromatin accessibility profiles (ATAC-seq) within microglia showed surprisingly little difference between young, aged, and PD groups. However, peak–gene association analysis revealed that the regulatory relationships between accessible chromatin regions and gene expression are substantially altered during aging and PD, particularly at distal enhancer regions. <keyFinding priority='2'> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**GWAS SNP Enrichment**

Microglial-specific ATAC peaks were significantly enriched for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) GWAS SNPs, but not for PD SNPs, consistent with previous studies. However, some PD-associated SNPs were found in microglial peaks, and their regulatory associations (peak–gene links) changed with disease state, suggesting potential cell-type-specific regulatory mechanisms. <keyFinding priority='2'> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators & Metrics**

Age and PD status are the primary modulators of microglial state transitions in this study. No strong evidence for sex or APOE genotype effects on microglia is discussed in this paper.

**Spatial/Morphological Validation**

No specific spatial or morphological validation of microglial subtypes is reported; validation is primarily at the transcriptomic and chromatin level.

</findings>

<clinical>
Microglia in the human midbrain exhibit a progressive loss of homeostatic features and increased immune activation with aging, which is further exacerbated in Parkinson’s disease. The emergence of a TREM2-independent disease-associated microglial state in PD suggests a distinct activation pathway from that described in Alzheimer’s disease. These findings imply that microglial dysfunction and chronic activation may contribute to PD pathogenesis, potentially via neuroinflammatory mechanisms. While the study identifies molecular signatures and regulatory changes, it does not establish direct causality between microglial changes and neuronal degeneration. The altered microglial gene modules and trajectory scores may serve as potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets for modulating neuroinflammation in PD, but further functional validation is required.
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications**

This study provides a high-resolution, multiomic map of microglial heterogeneity and state transitions in the aging and PD midbrain. The identification of a TREM2-independent disease-associated microglial state in PD contrasts with the TREM2-dependent DAM described in Alzheimer’s disease, highlighting disease- and region-specific microglial responses (<contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>). The strong association of microglial activation with aging and PD progression underscores the need to dissect the functional consequences of these states, particularly their roles in neuroinflammation and neuronal vulnerability. Open questions include the causal relationship between microglial activation and dopaminergic neuron loss, the reversibility of disease-associated states, and the impact of genetic risk variants on microglial function. The study’s findings align with emerging models of microglial diversity but also reveal unique features in the human midbrain, suggesting that therapeutic strategies may need to be tailored to disease context and brain region. Future work should integrate spatial transcriptomics, functional assays, and longitudinal sampling to clarify the dynamics and impact of microglial subtypes in PD.

Disease focus: Huntington’s disease (HD)
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on postmortem human anterior cingulate cortex from grade III/IV HD patients and non-neurological controls. Nuclei were isolated from frozen tissue, processed using the 10x Genomics Chromium platform, and sequenced on Illumina NovaSeq. Cell types were identified via unsupervised clustering and supervised classification based on curated marker gene sets. Sub-clustering and differential expression analyses were performed, with validation by immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, and qPCR.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Microglia comprised a small but comparable proportion of nuclei in both HD and control cingulate cortex samples (3% in each group), with no significant quantitative change in overall microglial abundance reported.

**Differential Gene Expression:**  
Microglia in HD cingulate cortex exhibited significant transcriptional changes compared to controls. Differentially expressed genes included upregulation of immune response and inflammatory pathway genes, notably those involved in complement activation, toll-like receptor signaling, and interleukin signaling (including IL-10, IL-13, and IL-4 pathways). Specific microglial marker genes with altered expression were not exhaustively detailed in the main text, but the supplementary data (Additional file 14) highlight upregulation of genes associated with innate immune activation.

**Pathway Enrichment:**  
Gene ontology and Reactome pathway analyses of upregulated genes in HD microglia revealed enrichment for immune response, complement cascade, and cytokine signaling. Downregulated genes were not specifically discussed for microglia.

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
The study did not report the identification of distinct microglial subtypes or states beyond the general disease-associated activation signature. Microglial nuclei from HD and control samples clustered separately in tSNE and consensus clustering analyses, indicating a disease-associated transcriptional shift. However, the authors did not define or name discrete microglial subpopulations (e.g., DAM, homeostatic, or proliferative states) as has been done in some other neurodegenerative disease studies.

**Morphological/Spatial Validation:**  
No specific morphological or spatial validation of microglial subtypes or activation states was reported. Immunohistochemistry for microglial markers (e.g., IBA1, LN3) was performed, but the main focus was on astrocytes.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
No pseudotime or trajectory analysis was performed for microglia. The study did not address temporal progression or transitions between microglial states.

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
No explicit analysis of host or genetic factors (e.g., age, sex, CAG repeat length, or GWAS variants) modulating microglial activation was presented.

**Gene Regulatory Networks:**  
Gene network or module analysis was performed for astrocytes but not for microglia.

**Cell-Cell Communication:**  
No ligand-receptor or cell-cell communication analysis involving microglia was reported.

**Spatial Analysis:**  
No spatial transcriptomics or in situ validation of microglial activation was included.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
No eQTL or multi-omic integration for microglia was presented.

<keyFinding priority='2'>
Microglia in HD cingulate cortex exhibit a robust disease-associated transcriptional activation signature, characterized by upregulation of innate immune and inflammatory pathways, including complement and interleukin signaling.
</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
Microglia in HD cingulate cortex display a disease-associated activation profile, with upregulation of genes involved in innate immunity and inflammation. While these changes are strongly associated with HD pathology, the study does not provide direct evidence for a causal role of microglial activation in neuronal degeneration or clinical progression. The findings suggest that microglial activation may contribute to the inflammatory milieu in HD cortex, potentially influencing disease progression, but further functional studies are required. No microglial subtypes with clear therapeutic or biomarker implications were identified in this dataset.

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**  
In the cingulate cortex of Huntington’s disease (HD) patients, microglia exhibit a robust disease-associated activation signature, with upregulation of innate immune and inflammatory pathways, including complement and interleukin signaling. While the overall proportion of microglia does not change, their transcriptomic profile shifts markedly in HD. No distinct microglial subtypes or spatial/morphological validation were reported, and no genetic or demographic modulators were identified as key drivers of microglial activation in this study.

**Detailed Summary (≈800–1000 words):**  
<metadata>
Al-Dalahmah et al. (2020) conducted a single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) study of the anterior cingulate cortex in Huntington’s disease (HD), focusing primarily on astrocytes but also reporting significant findings in other glial and neuronal populations. The study included postmortem samples from grade III/IV HD patients and non-neurological controls, aiming to uncover cell-type-specific transcriptional changes associated with HD pathology.
</metadata>

<methods>
Nuclei were isolated from frozen cingulate cortex and subjected to droplet-based snRNA-seq using the 10x Genomics Chromium platform. After quality control, 4786 nuclei were analyzed, with cell types assigned via unsupervised clustering and supervised classification based on curated marker gene sets. Sub-clustering and differential expression analyses were performed for each major cell type, including microglia. Validation experiments focused on astrocytes, with limited morphological or spatial validation for microglia.
</methods>

<findings>
Microglia represented a small but consistent fraction of nuclei in both HD and control samples (3% each), with no significant change in overall abundance. However, microglial nuclei from HD and control brains clustered separately in tSNE and consensus clustering analyses, indicating a marked disease-associated transcriptional shift.

Differential gene expression analysis revealed that HD microglia upregulate a suite of genes involved in innate immune activation and inflammation. Pathway enrichment analyses highlighted significant upregulation of complement cascade components, toll-like receptor signaling, and interleukin signaling pathways (notably IL-10, IL-13, and IL-4). These findings are consistent with a robust activation of microglia in the HD cortex, paralleling observations in other neurodegenerative diseases.

The study did not identify or name discrete microglial subtypes or states (such as homeostatic, disease-associated microglia [DAM], or proliferative states) within the HD or control samples. Instead, the primary finding was a global shift in microglial gene expression toward an activated, inflammatory profile in HD. No evidence was presented for the emergence of novel microglial subpopulations or for the loss of homeostatic microglial markers.

Morphological or spatial validation of microglial activation was not performed. While immunohistochemistry for microglial markers (e.g., IBA1, LN3) was conducted, the main focus was on astrocytic changes, and no quantitative or qualitative assessment of microglial morphology or spatial distribution was reported.

No trajectory or pseudotime analysis was performed for microglia, and the study did not address potential transitions between microglial states over the course of disease progression. Similarly, no analysis of host or genetic factors (such as age, sex, CAG repeat length, or GWAS variants) influencing microglial activation was presented.

Gene network and module analyses were performed for astrocytes but not for microglia. No ligand-receptor or cell-cell communication analyses involving microglia were reported, and no spatial transcriptomics or in situ validation of microglial activation was included. The study did not integrate genetic or multi-omic data to link microglial activation to HD risk variants or clinical phenotypes.

<keyFinding priority='2'>
The principal finding for microglia is the robust upregulation of innate immune and inflammatory pathways in HD cingulate cortex, without evidence for the emergence of distinct microglial subtypes or states.
</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
The disease-associated activation of microglia in HD cortex suggests a potential role for neuroinflammation in HD pathogenesis. However, the study does not provide direct evidence for a causal relationship between microglial activation and neuronal degeneration or clinical progression. The findings are associative and do not establish whether microglial activation is a driver or a consequence of neurodegeneration in HD. No microglial subtypes with clear therapeutic or biomarker potential were identified, and further studies are needed to elucidate the functional significance of microglial activation in HD.
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words):**  
This study demonstrates that microglia in the HD cingulate cortex undergo a pronounced transcriptional shift toward an activated, inflammatory state, characterized by upregulation of complement and interleukin signaling pathways. However, the absence of distinct microglial subtypes or states (such as DAM or proliferative microglia) contrasts with findings in other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer’s disease, where such subpopulations have been described. The lack of spatial, morphological, or temporal analysis limits the ability to relate microglial activation to disease progression or regional vulnerability. Future studies should aim to resolve microglial heterogeneity at higher resolution, incorporate spatial and longitudinal data, and investigate the functional consequences of microglial activation in HD. The findings align with the broader literature on neuroinflammation in HD but do not resolve whether microglial activation is protective, detrimental, or both at different disease stages. No explicit contradictions with prior models were discussed by the authors.

**Quick Reference (≈50–100 words):**
This study of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia used snRNA-seq, IHC, and spatial transcriptomics, but specifically enriched for neurons and excluded glial cells—including microglia—from downstream analyses. As a result, no microglial subtypes, marker genes, or disease associations were characterized or reported. All major findings relate to neuronal populations.

**Detailed Summary (≈800–1000 words):**

<metadata>
Batiuk et al. (2022) present a comprehensive single-nucleus transcriptomic and spatial analysis of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) in schizophrenia, focusing on neuronal diversity and vulnerability. The study does not address microglial biology.
</metadata>

<methods>
The authors performed snRNA-seq on over 220,000 nuclei from postmortem DLPFC (BA9) of 9 schizophrenia patients and 14 matched controls. The experimental workflow involved NeuN+ sorting to enrich for neuronal nuclei, with glial nuclei (including microglia) representing only a minor fraction (~6%) of the dataset. These glial nuclei were explicitly excluded from downstream analyses, which focused on neuronal subtypes. Validation was performed using immunohistochemistry and Visium spatial transcriptomics, again with a neuronal focus.
</methods>

<findings>
The study’s design and analytical pipeline were tailored to interrogate neuronal heterogeneity and disease-associated changes in schizophrenia. Microglia and other glial cells were not a focus and were systematically excluded from the main analyses. The following points summarize the microglia-relevant content:

- **Cell Type Proportions:** The initial dataset included a small fraction of glial nuclei, but these were removed prior to clustering, annotation, and all subsequent analyses. The authors state: “Because our study was focused on neurons, glial nuclei were excluded from the subsequent analyses.”
- **Subtype Identification:** No microglial subtypes or states were identified, named, or characterized. The clustering and annotation framework was built around neuronal markers and subtypes.
- **Differential Expression and Pathways:** No microglia-specific differential gene expression or pathway enrichment analyses were performed. All reported transcriptomic changes, pathway enrichments, and gene regulatory network analyses pertain to neuronal populations.
- **Spatial and Morphological Validation:** Immunohistochemistry and spatial transcriptomics were used to validate neuronal findings. No microglia-specific spatial or morphological data are presented.
- **Modulators, Metrics, and Disease Trajectories:** No host or genetic factors, activation scores, or disease progression analyses were performed for microglia.
- **Gene Regulatory Networks and Cell-Cell Communication:** The study does not address microglial transcriptional regulation or intercellular signaling.
- **Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:** No integration of microglial transcriptomic data with genetic risk variants or multi-omic datasets is reported.

The only mention of glial cells is in the context of quality control and exclusion from the main dataset. There is no discussion of microglial activation, heterogeneity, or involvement in schizophrenia pathophysiology. The authors do not report any negative findings or explicitly state the absence of microglial changes; rather, microglia are simply outside the scope of the study’s design and analysis.

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words):**
This study exemplifies a neuron-centric approach to single-nucleus transcriptomics in psychiatric disease, with microglia and other glial cells systematically excluded from analysis. As such, it does not contribute to the understanding of microglial heterogeneity, activation states, or their potential roles in schizophrenia. The absence of microglial data highlights a gap in the current literature and underscores the need for future studies that specifically profile microglia—using unbiased nuclei isolation or glia-enrichment protocols—to elucidate their contributions to disease mechanisms. The findings here neither support nor contradict existing models of microglial involvement in schizophrenia, as the cell type was not interrogated. Researchers interested in microglial biology in psychiatric disorders should seek out studies with explicit glial or microglial profiling, as this work does not address those questions.

# summary for Brase 2021 (microglia)

**Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This large-scale snRNA-seq study of human parietal cortex in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) identifies substantial microglial heterogeneity linked to genetic risk and resilience. Notably, a unique microglial state (Mic.4) is strongly enriched in autosomal dominant AD (APP/PSEN1 mutation carriers), marked by upregulation of MECP2 and pathways related to cell death. TREM2 risk variant carriers (p.R47H, p.R62H, p.H157Y) show increased proportions of a resting-like microglial state (Mic.2), while carriers of the MS4A resilience allele (rs1582763-A) are enriched for a distinct proinflammatory microglial state (Mic.3). These microglial states are modulated by specific genetic backgrounds and validated in independent human and mouse datasets.

Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD), including autosomal dominant (ADAD) and sporadic forms, with emphasis on genetic risk/resilience variants (APP, PSEN1, TREM2, MS4A).
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on 294,114 nuclei from the parietal cortex (Brodmann areas 1–3, 7) of 67 postmortem human brains, including carriers of ADAD mutations (APP, PSEN1), TREM2 risk variants, and the MS4A resilience allele (rs1582763-A), as well as controls. Deep subclustering identified cell-type-specific transcriptional states. Replication was performed using human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (ROSMAP) and 5xFAD mouse model datasets. Validation included pathway analysis and cross-cohort signature scoring.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Identification**

Microglia were subclustered into nine transcriptional states. Three states—Mic.4, Mic.2, and Mic.3—showed strong associations with specific genetic backgrounds and disease status.

**Mic.4: ADAD-Enriched Microglial State**
<keyFinding priority='1'>
Mic.4 is a prominent microglial state highly enriched in ADAD (APP/PSEN1 mutation carriers; β=0.40, P=2.50×10⁻³), comprising nuclei from 11 PSEN1 carriers and one TREM2 p.R136W carrier. This state is not significantly overlapping with previously described DAM, MGnD, or HAM signatures, indicating a potentially novel disease-associated microglial phenotype.
</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Mic.4 is defined by upregulation of MECP2 (β=0.67, Adj.P=3.20×10⁻¹⁰), a gene implicated in neuronal cell death and Rett syndrome, and is enriched for pathways including MAPK signaling, estrogen signaling, NOD-like receptor signaling, and necroptosis—suggesting an acute, cell-death–related response. This state was also observed in 5xFAD mouse cortex (P=1.92×10⁻³⁷⁴), supporting cross-species relevance.

**Mic.2: TREM2 Risk Variant-Associated Resting-Like Microglia**
<keyFinding priority='1'>
TREM2 risk variant carriers (p.R47H, p.R62H, p.H157Y) exhibit increased proportions of Mic.2 (β=0.23, P=3.29×10⁻²), a microglial state with high expression of resting-state markers (TMEM119, P2RY13, MED12L, SELPLG) and minimal activation marker expression. This suggests a reduced-activation or homeostatic-like phenotype in these carriers.
</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Replication in the ROSMAP cohort (DLPFC) confirmed enrichment of this state in TREM2 p.R62H carriers (β=0.20, P=2.58×10⁻²; meta-analysis P=2.26×10⁻²). This aligns with prior reports of reduced microglial activation in these TREM2 variants.

**Mic.3: MS4A Resilience Variant-Associated Proinflammatory Microglia**
<keyFinding priority='1'>
Carriers of the MS4A resilience allele (rs1582763-A) are enriched for Mic.3 (β=0.15, P=1.67×10⁻³), a microglial state with a distinct proinflammatory profile, including upregulation of IL1B (log2FC=3.45), CD14, FCGR3A, and CD40. This state is distinct from the main activated microglia (Mic.1), which is depleted in rs1582763-A carriers.
</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Mic.3 is characterized by increased expression of complement C3 (log2FC=-1.24), TGF-β signaling genes (TGFBR1, TGFBR2), and cytokine response pathways, contrasting with Mic.1, which shows higher C5 and BMP signaling. The presence of Mic.3 in the ROSMAP cohort was confirmed by signature scoring, though association with genotype was not significant, likely due to low numbers of homozygous carriers.

**Other Microglial States**
Mic.1 represents the main activated microglial state, upregulated for CD68, CD83, TNFAIP3, C5AR1, GPNMB, and ABCA1, and overlaps with DAM, MGnD, HAM, and aging signatures. Its proportion is reduced in MS4A resilience allele carriers.

**Genetic Modulators and Disease Trajectories**
- The TREM2 p.R136W variant, though rare, showed a microglial transcriptional profile clustering with ADAD rather than other TREM2 variants, suggesting a more severe or distinct impact.
- No unique microglial state was associated with APOE ε4, though pathway analysis indicated upregulation of ribosome biogenesis and mitotic checkpoint genes in microglia from ε4 carriers.

**Validation and Replication**
- The Mic.4 (ADAD-enriched) state was validated in 5xFAD mouse microglia, with strong conservation of the upregulated gene signature.
- The Mic.2 (TREM2 risk variant) and Mic.3 (MS4A resilience) states were replicated in the ROSMAP human DLPFC dataset, supporting their generalizability across brain regions and cohorts.

**Pathway Enrichment and Functional Implications**
- Mic.4: MAPK, estrogen, NOD-like receptor, necroptosis pathways (cell death, acute response).
- Mic.2: Resting/homeostatic microglial markers, reduced activation.
- Mic.3: Proinflammatory cytokine response, complement C3, TGF-β signaling, cytokine and LPS response.

**Cell-Cell Communication and Cross-Talk**
- MS4A resilience allele carriers also showed decreased resting astrocytes and a trend toward increased activated astrocytes, despite MS4A genes not being expressed in astrocytes, suggesting possible microglia-astrocyte cross-talk.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**
- The ADAD-enriched microglial state (Mic.4) may represent an advanced or accelerated disease stage, as similar states are found in late-stage pathology in both ADAD and sAD (ROSMAP DLPFC).

</findings>

<clinical>
Microglial heterogeneity in AD is strongly shaped by genetic background. The ADAD-enriched Mic.4 state may contribute to acute neurodegeneration via cell death pathways, while TREM2 risk variants promote a less activated, potentially less protective microglial phenotype. The MS4A resilience allele shifts microglia toward a proinflammatory but potentially protective state (Mic.3), with upregulation of complement C3 and TGF-β signaling, both implicated in neuroprotection. These findings suggest that microglial states are not only markers but may actively modulate disease progression, and that genetic stratification could inform therapeutic targeting of microglial subtypes in AD.

**Research Implications (≈200 words)**

This study provides a comprehensive map of microglial heterogeneity in the human AD cortex, revealing that genetic risk and resilience variants drive distinct microglial states with unique transcriptional and functional signatures. The identification of Mic.4 as an ADAD-specific, cell-death–associated microglial state, and the demonstration that TREM2 and MS4A variants modulate microglial activation, highlight the need for genetic stratification in both research and clinical trials. The findings align with, but also extend, previous microglial classification schemes (e.g., DAM, MGnD, HAM), as several newly described states (Mic.4, Mic.2, Mic.3) do not fully overlap with established signatures, suggesting additional layers of microglial diversity.

Open questions include the precise functional consequences of these microglial states in vivo, their temporal dynamics during disease progression, and their potential as therapeutic targets. The study’s cross-validation in independent human and mouse datasets strengthens confidence in these subtypes, but further work is needed to dissect causal relationships and to determine whether modulating specific microglial states can alter disease trajectory. The explicit mapping of GWAS loci to microglial subtypes also provides a framework for future cell-type–specific functional genomics in AD.

**Cell Type Proportions and General Trends**
Microglia comprised a major glial population in the parietal cortex. Overall, microglia and oligodendrocytes showed a trend toward gene overexpression in AD groups, suggesting increased functional activity, in contrast to underexpression in neurons and astrocytes. No significant overall change in microglial abundance was reported across disease groups, but distinct microglial subtypes showed strong genotype- and disease-specific enrichment.

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathways**
- Shared upregulation of FLT1 and PTPRG in microglia across sAD, TREM2, and ADAD; FARP1 upregulated in sAD, ADAD, and APOEε4+.
- Pathways: Stress response (Mic-stress), proinflammatory/cytokine signaling (Mic-proinflammatory), complement cascade (C3/C5), and homeostatic maintenance (Mic-reduced).
- Gene regulatory networks: No specific microglial TFs highlighted, but integration with snATAC-seq confirmed microglia as the cell type with the highest fraction of AD GWAS gene co-accessibility.

**Modulators & Metrics**
- TREM2 reduced-activation variants (p.R47H, p.R62H, p.H157Y) drive enrichment of Mic-reduced and a specific oligodendrocyte state (Oligo-TFEB).
- MS4A rs1582763-A (resilience allele) drives Mic-proinflammatory enrichment.
- APOEε4 status reduces Mic-PNNs and a specific inhibitory neuron state.

**Spatial/Morphological Validation**
- Mic-stress signature validated in 5xFAD mouse microglia.
- Replication of key microglial states in independent human (ROSMAP) and mouse datasets.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**
- Mic-stress may represent an accelerated or advanced disease state, as it is present in ADAD parietal cortex and late-stage sAD DLPFC.

**Genetic/Multi-omic Integration**
- Microglia show the highest cell-type-specific chromatin co-accessibility with AD GWAS loci (e.g., BIN1), supporting their role as effector cells for genetic risk.
</findings>

<clinical>
Microglial subtypes show strong genotype- and disease-specific associations in AD. The Mic-stress state, highly enriched in ADAD, may represent a unique, advanced, or accelerated microglial response not captured by canonical DAM/MGnD/HAM signatures, and is linked to MECP2 upregulation and stress pathways. TREM2 reduced-activation variants promote a homeostatic microglial state (Mic-reduced), potentially reducing microglial activation and altering disease progression. The MS4A resilience allele (rs1582763-A) is associated with a distinct proinflammatory microglial state (Mic-proinflammatory) with altered complement signaling (C3 up, C5 down), which may underlie its protective effect. APOEε4 carriers show reduced microglial states involved in perineuronal net maintenance, potentially contributing to impaired plasticity and cognitive decline. These findings suggest that microglial heterogeneity, shaped by genetic background, may drive or mitigate AD pathology and could inform therapeutic targeting of specific microglial states.

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**

This study identifies distinct microglial subtypes in the parietal cortex of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brains, with strong genetic and disease associations. A unique stress-response microglial state (Mic-stress), marked by MECP2 upregulation, is highly enriched in autosomal dominant AD (ADAD). TREM2 reduced-activation variants (p.R47H, p.R62H, p.H157Y) promote a homeostatic microglial state (Mic-reduced), while the MS4A resilience allele (rs1582763-A) drives a proinflammatory microglial state (Mic-proinflammatory) with altered complement signaling. APOEε4 carriers show reduced microglial states involved in perineuronal net maintenance. These subtypes are validated in independent human and mouse datasets and are modulated by key AD risk/resilience alleles.

Microglia were a major glial population in the parietal cortex, with no significant overall change in abundance across disease groups. However, subclustering revealed pronounced heterogeneity, with distinct microglial states showing strong genotype- and disease-specific enrichment.

**Mic-stress (Mic.4):** This microglial state was highly enriched in ADAD (APP/PSEN1 mutation carriers; β = 0.40, p = 2.5×10⁻³), capturing nuclei from 11 PSEN1 carriers and one TREM2 p.R136W carrier.

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words):**

This study demonstrates that microglial heterogeneity in the human parietal cortex is strongly shaped by AD genetic architecture, with distinct subtypes associated with ADAD, TREM2, MS4A, and APOEε4 status. The identification of a unique ADAD-enriched stress-response microglial state (Mic-stress), not matching canonical DAM/MGnD/HAM, suggests that current models may not fully capture the diversity of microglial responses in genetic AD. The strong genotype-specific enrichment of homeostatic (Mic-reduced) and proinflammatory (Mic-proinflammatory) states in TREM2 and MS4A variant carriers, respectively, highlights the need for precision targeting of microglial subtypes in therapeutic development. The findings align with, but also extend, prior classification schemes by revealing novel states and genetic drivers. Open questions include the functional consequences of these states for neurodegeneration, their temporal dynamics in disease progression, and their potential as biomarkers or therapeutic targets. The study’s integration of snRNA-seq, snATAC-seq, and replication in independent datasets strengthens confidence in these findings, though further work is needed to dissect causal mechanisms and validate these states in additional brain regions and longitudinal cohorts. No explicit contradictions with prior models were discussed by the authors.

This study used single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to profile the human prefrontal cortex in alcohol-dependent and control individuals, revealing that microglia exhibit a distinct set of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in alcoholism, including upregulation of TLR2 and downregulation of CACNA1A. Microglial DEGs were largely undetectable in bulk RNA-seq, highlighting cell-type specificity, and showed no significant change in microglial proportion between groups. <keyFinding priority='1'>Microglial transcriptional changes in alcoholism are distinct from other cell types and are not reflected in bulk tissue analyses.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>

Disease focus: Alcohol dependence (alcoholism)
</metadata>

<methods>
The study employed droplet-based single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on frozen postmortem prefrontal cortex (PFC) tissue from seven donors (four controls, three alcohol-dependent). Over 16,000 nuclei were analyzed and clustered into seven major brain cell types, including microglia, using established marker genes. Differential expression was assessed using a pseudo-bulk approach with DESeq2, and pathway analysis was performed with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA).  
</methods>

<findings>
The authors identified microglia as a distinct cluster based on canonical marker genes (e.g., CSF1R, P2RY12, TMEM119; see Fig. 1C/E), with proportions consistent across donors and no significant difference between alcoholics and controls. <keyFinding priority='2'>There was no evidence for a change in microglial abundance in alcohol dependence.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression in Microglia:**  
Microglia displayed a moderate number of DEGs (33 at FDR < 0.25), with both protein-coding and non-coding transcripts represented (Fig. 3A/B, 6B).

**Key Microglial DEGs and Markers:**  
- **TLR2**: Strongly enriched in microglia (Fig. 2A/B/C), serving as a defining marker in both control and alcoholic brains.  
- **CACNA1A**: Downregulated in astrocytes but upregulated in microglia in alcoholism (Fig. 3D, 6B).  
- **SLC11A1**: The only microglial DEG also detected in bulk RNA-seq, suggesting a particularly large effect size.  
- Other notable DEGs include PTXRM, VSIG4, SPATA6, FMN1, MYO1E, PRKD3, KCNMA1, and several non-coding RNAs (Fig. 6B).

**Functional and Pathway Analysis:**  
IPA pathway analysis revealed that only astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglia showed significant pathway enrichment among DEGs. For microglia, the top pathways included GNRH signaling and neuroinflammatory signaling, with CACNA1A as a notable DEG in these pathways. <keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial DEGs are implicated in neuroinflammatory and calcium signaling pathways, potentially linking microglial activation to alcohol dependence.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell-Cell Communication and Spatial Validation:**  
The study did not report ligand-receptor analyses or spatial/morphological validation for microglial subpopulations. However, TLR2 expression was visualized and confirmed to be microglia-specific across both groups (Fig. 2B/C).

**Comparison to Bulk RNA-seq and Other Cell Types:**  
Hierarchical clustering of DE patterns showed that microglia were the most dissimilar to bulk RNA-seq data compared to other cell types (Fig. 6A). This supports the notion that microglial transcriptional changes are underrepresented in bulk analyses. <keyFinding priority='1'>Microglial-specific transcriptional alterations in alcoholism are masked in bulk tissue studies.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators and Metrics:**  
No significant associations with demographic or genetic factors (e.g., age, sex, GWAS risk variants) were reported for microglia in this study. GWAS enrichment was significant only for astrocytes.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
No pseudotime or trajectory analyses were performed; thus, temporal or stage-specific microglial changes were not addressed.

</findings>

<clinical>
Microglia in the alcoholic human PFC exhibit a unique transcriptional response, with upregulation of neuroimmune genes such as TLR2 and altered expression of genes involved in calcium signaling (e.g., CACNA1A). These changes may reflect microglial activation or altered neuroimmune function in alcohol dependence, but the study does not establish causality or functional consequences. The lack of microglial DEGs in bulk RNA-seq highlights the importance of cell-type-resolved approaches for identifying potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers in alcoholism. <keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial gene expression changes may contribute to neuroinflammatory processes in alcohol dependence, but further functional validation is needed.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</clinical>

**Research Implications**

This study demonstrates that microglia in the human alcoholic brain undergo cell-type-specific transcriptional changes that are largely invisible to bulk RNA-seq approaches. The identification of microglial DEGs such as TLR2 and CACNA1A suggests potential involvement in neuroimmune and calcium signaling pathways, but the absence of subclustering or trajectory analysis limits insight into microglial heterogeneity or disease-associated states. Future research should focus on higher-resolution subclustering to define microglial subtypes (e.g., homeostatic vs. activated/disease-associated microglia), integrate spatial or morphological validation, and assess the functional impact of these transcriptional changes. The findings are consistent with prior reports of microglial underrepresentation in bulk transcriptomics, but the study does not explicitly discuss contradictions with previous microglial classification schemes. Open questions remain regarding the causal role of microglial activation in alcohol dependence and whether these transcriptional changes are reversible or stage-specific. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

All subtypes were validated by comparison to live-cell scRNA-seq data, and marker gene expression was consistent with prior studies <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>. The study found that the snRNA-seq approach did not miss microglial states previously identified in live-cell data, addressing concerns about technical artifacts in nucleus-based profiling.

**Cell Type Proportions:**  
No significant overall change in total microglial proportion was observed across AD and control groups. However, the redox (Mic.3) and interferon-response (Mic.4) subtypes increased in individuals with higher tau pathology and cognitive decline, as inferred from both snRNA-seq and CelMod deconvolution in the larger cohort.

**Pathway Enrichment:**  
Mic.3 was enriched for oxidative stress and redox pathways; Mic.4 for interferon response and immune activation. These pathways are implicated in neurodegenerative processes.

**Cell-Cell Communication:**  
Mic.3 was part of a multicellular community (with specific astrocyte and oligodendrocyte subtypes) whose coordinated increase was associated with cognitive decline and tau pathology. Ligand-receptor analysis suggested increased signaling within this community, including immune and stress-related pathways.

**Spatial/Morphological Validation:**  
No specific spatial or morphological validation was reported for microglial subtypes, but overall microglial marker expression was consistent with known patterns.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
Temporal modeling and mediation analysis suggested that changes in Mic.3 and Mic.4 are downstream of tau pathology and may partially mediate its effect on cognitive decline, though the effect size is modest (2.7–7% of the tau-cognition association) <keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>.

**Genetic/Demographic Modulators:**  
No strong effects of age, sex, or APOE genotype on microglial subtypes were reported in this study.

**Contradictions:**  
The authors explicitly note that their snRNA-seq data captured all microglial states previously identified in live-cell data, countering earlier concerns that nucleus-based methods might miss activation states <contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag> (see Thrupp et al., 2020, Cell Rep. 32, 108189).

</findings>

<clinical>
Microglial subtypes, particularly the redox (Mic.3) and interferon-response (Mic.4) states, are strongly associated with tau pathology and cognitive decline in aging and AD, suggesting that microglial oxidative stress and immune activation may contribute to neurodegeneration. However, these associations are correlative, and mediation analysis indicates only a modest contribution to the link between tau pathology and cognitive decline. The findings support the idea that microglial activation is a component of multicellular communities driving disease progression, but do not establish microglia as primary causal agents. Therapeutically, targeting microglial redox and interferon pathways may be relevant, but further functional validation is needed.
</clinical>

<researchImplications>
This study provides a robust cross-validation of microglial subtypes in human cortex, confirming that snRNA-seq captures the full diversity of microglial states seen in live-cell data. The identification of Mic.3 (redox) and Mic.4 (interferon-response) as components of a multicellular community associated with cognitive decline and tau pathology highlights the importance of considering microglia in the context of broader glial-neuronal interactions. Open questions remain regarding the functional roles of these subtypes, their temporal dynamics, and their response to genetic risk factors (e.g., TREM2, APOE), which were not prominent modulators in this dataset. The modest mediation effect suggests that microglial activation is one of several parallel processes linking tau pathology to cognitive decline. Future studies should focus on spatial validation, longitudinal dynamics, and experimental manipulation of these microglial states to clarify causality and therapeutic potential. The authors explicitly address and refute prior concerns (Thrupp et al., 2020) that snRNA-seq underestimates microglial activation, strengthening confidence in nucleus-based profiling for microglia.

Disease focus: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD)
</metadata>

<methods>
This study used single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) samples from 118 postmortem brains (PTSD, MDD, neurotypical controls), as part of a broader multiomic analysis (including bulk RNA-seq, methylomics, proteomics) across three brain regions (mPFC, DG, CeA). Cell type–specific transcriptomic signatures were meta-analyzed across batches. Cell type annotation and differential expression were performed, with validation by replication cohorts and integration with blood proteomics and GWAS data.
</methods>

<quickReference>
The study found that microglia in the dlPFC of PTSD and MDD subjects did not show significant changes in overall proportion but exhibited disease- and cell type–specific transcriptomic alterations. In MDD, microglia showed downregulation of ribosome-related and metabolic pathways, while in PTSD, inflammatory pathways were upregulated in microglia. These microglial states were modulated by diagnosis and were distinct from changes in other glial and neuronal populations.
</quickReference>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions**:  
Across the primary snRNA-seq analysis of dlPFC, there were no significant differences in the overall proportion of microglia between PTSD, MDD, and control groups (tables S1B-1, S1B-2; table S7C-3). However, some differences in microglia and OPC proportions were noted in MDD in batch-specific analyses, but these were not the main drivers of disease signal.  
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>  
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression (DGE) and Pathways**:  
Microglia in PTSD and MDD displayed distinct transcriptomic signatures:
- In PTSD, microglia showed upregulation of inflammatory pathways, consistent with broader immune activation observed in bulk tissue and other glial populations.  
- In MDD, microglia exhibited downregulation of ribosome-related processes and metabolic/mitochondrial pathways, as well as downregulation of glia-related pathways.  
- In both disorders, microglia showed downregulation of ribosome-related processes, but this was more pronounced in MDD.  
- Inflammatory pathways were upregulated in PTSD microglia but downregulated in MDD microglia, suggesting divergent immune signaling regulation between the disorders.

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization**:  
The study did not report further subclustering of microglia into distinct subtypes or states beyond the broad cell type level in the main text or figures. Instead, microglia were analyzed as a single population per diagnosis.  
- No homeostatic vs. disease-associated microglia subtypes were explicitly defined or named (e.g., no DAM, Mic.1, etc.).
- Marker genes for microglia were not specifically listed in the main text, but pathway-level changes were described.
- Microglia were included in the cell type–specific gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), which highlighted the above pathway changes.
<keyFinding priority='3'>No distinct microglial subtypes or states were defined; analysis was at the broad cell type level.</keyFinding>  
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>  
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Functional Implications**:  
- The upregulation of inflammatory pathways in PTSD microglia aligns with the broader immune activation signature seen in PTSD across omics and brain regions.
- The downregulation of ribosomal and metabolic pathways in MDD microglia may reflect impaired protein synthesis and cellular energetics, potentially contributing to altered microglial function in depression.
- The divergent regulation of immune pathways in microglia between PTSD (up) and MDD (down) suggests diagnosis-specific microglial responses to stress and disease.

**Modulators & Metrics**:  
- No explicit mention of genetic, sex, or age effects on microglial states in the main text.
- No quantitative activation or morphology scores for microglia were reported.
- No spatial or morphological validation (e.g., immunostaining) for microglial states was described.

**Gene Regulatory Networks & Cell-Cell Communication**:  
- The study highlighted STAT3 as a prominent upstream regulator across omics, including in glial cells, but did not specify microglia-specific transcriptional regulators.
- No microglia-specific ligand-receptor or cell-cell communication findings were detailed.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**:  
- The multiomic factor analysis identified a latent factor (factor 13) associated with age acceleration in both PTSD and MDD, but this was not specifically linked to microglia.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**:  
- No microglia-specific eQTLs or genetic risk variant associations were reported.

<clinical>
Microglia in PTSD and MDD exhibit diagnosis-specific transcriptomic changes in the dlPFC, with PTSD characterized by microglial immune activation and MDD by suppression of microglial ribosomal and metabolic pathways. These findings suggest that microglia may contribute to the neuroimmune and metabolic dysregulation underlying stress-related psychiatric disorders, but the absence of distinct microglial subtypes or direct functional validation limits causal inference. The divergent microglial responses may have implications for targeting neuroinflammation in PTSD versus MDD, but further work is needed to establish microglial states as therapeutic or biomarker targets.
</clinical>

<researchImplications>
This study provides evidence for diagnosis-specific microglial transcriptomic responses in PTSD and MDD, but does not identify distinct microglial subtypes or states beyond the broad cell type level. The findings align with prior reports of immune activation in PTSD and metabolic suppression in MDD, but the lack of microglial subclustering or spatial validation leaves open questions about the existence of disease-associated microglial states (e.g., DAM, Mic.1) in psychiatric disorders. Future studies should employ higher-resolution snRNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, and functional assays to define microglial heterogeneity and its role in disease progression. The divergent immune signatures in microglia between PTSD and MDD may inform the development of tailored anti-inflammatory or metabolic interventions, but require further mechanistic validation. No explicit conflicts with prior microglial classification schemes were discussed by the authors.

# summary for Davila-Velderrain 2021 (microglia)

**Quick Reference (Microglia in Davila-Velderrain et al., bioRxiv 2021):**  
This large-scale snRNA-seq study of human hippocampus and entorhinal cortex in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) identifies microglia as a major cell type with AD-associated transcriptional changes, particularly in late-stage pathology. Microglial gene modules upregulated in AD are enriched for immune response, cell cycle, and unfolded protein response genes, with a distinct late-stage module (M12) containing APOE and other AD GWAS risk genes. These microglial alterations are consistent across hippocampal and entorhinal regions and are not strongly modulated by anatomical subregion or early vs. late Braak stage, but show convergence with prefrontal cortex only at late stages.

Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on 489,558 nuclei from hippocampus and entorhinal cortex of 65 aged human donors (31 AD, 34 controls), spanning early (Braak 3/4) and late (Braak 5/6) AD pathology. Cell types were annotated using graph-based clustering and marker gene enrichment, with validation via cross-species (mouse) transcriptomic and spatial data.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Microglia were robustly identified as a major cell type using canonical markers (e.g., CSF1R). The proportion of microglia did not show significant differences between AD and control groups or across Braak stages, as visualized in Figure 1f and described in the text. <keyFinding priority='3'>Microglial abundance is stable across disease and anatomical groups.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression & Pathway Enrichment:**  
Microglia exhibited prominent AD-associated transcriptional changes, especially in late-stage pathology. Among 2,495 neuropathology-associated genes, a substantial subset was preferentially expressed in microglia (Figure 4b-c).  
- Early-stage upregulation in microglia was less pronounced than in oligodendrocyte lineage cells or astrocytes.
- Late-stage upregulation in microglia was captured by module M12, which includes APOE, SORL1, ADAM10, PARP1, and SNCA—genes strongly implicated in AD risk and pathogenesis (Figure 4e-f, Supplementary Table S8).  
- Module M10, also upregulated in microglia, was enriched for cell cycle, protein translation, and unfolded protein response genes (e.g., EIF4G1, CDKN1A, BAX, HSPA6), suggesting activation of stress and immune pathways.  
- GO enrichment for microglial modules included exocytosis, immune response, and inflammation (M9, M14), as well as mitochondrial and metabolic processes (M2, M16), though the latter were more prominent in neurons and oligodendrocytes.

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
The study did not report further subclustering of microglia into distinct subtypes (e.g., homeostatic vs. disease-associated microglia, DAM) within the hippocampus or entorhinal cortex. Microglia were treated as a single transcriptional population for the purposes of AD association analysis.  
- Marker genes for microglia included CSF1R (canonical), with AD-associated upregulation of APOE, SORL1, and other risk genes in late-stage disease.
- No spatial or morphological validation (e.g., immunostaining for microglial activation markers) was reported for microglial subpopulations.
- The absence of microglial subtypes is notable, as the authors do not discuss DAM or other microglial activation states described in prior mouse or human cortical studies. <keyFinding priority='2'>Microglia were not further subdivided into homeostatic or disease-associated subtypes in this dataset.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
- The upregulation of the M12 microglial module is associated with late-stage (Braak 5/6) pathology, not with early-stage (Braak 3/4) or with anatomical subregion.
- The presence of APOE and other GWAS risk genes in M12 suggests genetic risk convergence on microglial pathways, but the study does not stratify microglial responses by APOE genotype or other host factors.
- No quantitative activation or morphology scores (e.g., microglial activation index, compactness) were reported.

**Gene Regulatory Networks & Cell-Cell Communication:**  
- The study does not report specific transcription factors or gene regulatory networks driving microglial activation in AD.
- No ligand-receptor or cell-cell communication analyses focused on microglia are presented.

**Spatial Analysis:**  
- No spatial transcriptomics or in situ validation of microglial activation states is reported for the hippocampus or entorhinal cortex.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
- Microglial transcriptional changes are primarily late-stage phenomena, with convergence across hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and prefrontal cortex only at advanced Braak stages (Figure 5b-c).
- Early-stage microglial changes are less pronounced compared to astrocytes or oligodendrocyte lineage cells.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
- Module M12, upregulated in microglia, is significantly enriched for AD GWAS risk genes, supporting a genetic link between microglial activation and AD pathogenesis.  
- No eQTL or direct multi-omic integration is performed at the microglial subtype level.

<keyFinding priority='1'>Microglial upregulation of APOE and other AD risk genes is a convergent late-stage feature across hippocampus, entorhinal cortex, and prefrontal cortex.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
Microglia in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex show robust transcriptional activation in late-stage AD, characterized by upregulation of immune response, cell cycle, and unfolded protein response genes, including key AD risk genes such as APOE. These findings reinforce the hypothesis that microglial activation is a core feature of late-stage AD pathology and may mediate genetic risk. However, the absence of distinct microglial subtypes or early-stage activation suggests that microglial responses in these regions are temporally downstream of neuronal and oligodendrocyte changes. The convergence of microglial transcriptional signatures across brain regions at late stages may have implications for biomarker development and therapeutic targeting of microglial pathways in AD, but causal or mechanistic claims remain tentative due to the cross-sectional nature of the data.
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications**

This study provides strong evidence that microglial activation, as measured by upregulation of APOE and other AD risk genes, is a hallmark of late-stage AD in the hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, paralleling findings in the prefrontal cortex. However, the lack of microglial subclustering or identification of disease-associated microglia (DAM) subtypes—contrary to prior mouse and human cortical studies—raises questions about regional or methodological differences in microglial heterogeneity. The authors do not explicitly discuss this discrepancy, but it suggests that either microglial activation in hippocampus/entorhinal cortex is more homogeneous, or that the resolution or sample size was insufficient to resolve subtypes. Future work should address whether DAM or other microglial states are present in these regions, and whether APOE genotype or other host factors modulate microglial responses. Integration with spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, or functional assays will be critical to clarify the role of microglia in early vs. late AD pathology and to resolve potential conflicts with prior models of microglial heterogeneity.

Disease focus: Alzheimer's disease (AD), including Mendelian (PSEN1 p.A79V) and sporadic forms.
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on frozen parietal lobe tissue from three female donors: one PSEN1 p.A79V mutation carrier (Mendelian AD) and two relatives with sporadic AD. Nuclei were unsorted; 10X Genomics platform was used. Both pre-mRNA and mature mRNA references were used for alignment, with pre-mRNA maximizing nuclei and gene detection. Data were processed using Seurat, with careful QC and clustering to minimize donor bias. Microglia were analyzed for disease-associated microglia (DAM) signatures using pseudotime analysis (TSCAN). No spatial or morphological validation was performed.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Microglia represented a minor fraction of total nuclei (0.7–1.5% per sample), with no significant differences in overall microglial proportion between Mendelian and sporadic AD brains. The study notes that the number of microglial nuclei was limited, constraining statistical power for subtype analysis.

**Differential Gene Expression & Pathway Enrichment:**  
The authors focused on whether human microglia in AD brains recapitulate the DAM signature previously described in mouse models. Of 500 DAM-associated genes from mouse, 326 human homologs were identified, and 92 were detected in human microglia nuclei. Pseudotime analysis of microglia revealed that 79 of these 92 DAM genes showed significant association with pseudotime (q < 0.05) when all microglia were pooled, suggesting a trajectory of activation or state change.

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
- The study did **not** identify distinct microglial subtypes or clusters beyond the main microglial population, likely due to low cell numbers.
- Pseudotime analysis was used to infer a trajectory of microglial activation, rather than discrete subtypes.
- When analyzed by donor, only 20 DAM genes were significantly associated with pseudotime in the PSEN1 carrier, and 20/18 in the two sporadic AD cases, with only five genes (EEF1A1, GLUL, KIAA1217, LDLRAD3, SPP1) consistently associated across all three.
- SPP1 (osteopontin), a canonical DAM marker, was among the top genes associated with pseudotime in all donors, supporting partial conservation of the DAM program in human AD microglia. <keyFinding priority='1'>SPP1 is a robust DAM marker in both Mendelian and sporadic AD microglia pseudotime trajectories.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- The authors caution that the limited number of microglial nuclei precluded robust identification of subtypes or state-specific proportions.

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
- No significant effect of APOE genotype on microglial clustering or DAM gene expression was observed, though sample size was limited.
- No quantitative activation or morphology scores were reported for microglia.

**Gene Regulatory Networks & Cell-Cell Communication:**  
- No specific transcription factors or ligand-receptor analyses were reported for microglia.

**Spatial Analysis:**  
- No spatial or morphological validation of microglial states was performed.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
- Pseudotime analysis suggests a continuum of microglial activation, with DAM gene expression increasing along this trajectory in both Mendelian and sporadic AD.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
- The study design allowed comparison of Mendelian (PSEN1) and sporadic AD, but no direct genetic association analyses (e.g., eQTL) were performed for microglia.

Del-Aguila et al. (2019) used snRNA-seq of parietal cortex from Mendelian (PSEN1 p.A79V) and sporadic AD brains to examine microglial states. Microglia were rare, and no distinct subtypes were identified, but pseudotime analysis revealed that a subset of DAM-associated genes, including SPP1 (osteopontin), were upregulated along an activation trajectory in both Mendelian and sporadic AD. SPP1 was consistently associated with microglial activation across all donors, regardless of genetic background.

The findings align with prior mouse and human studies in highlighting SPP1 as a key DAM marker, but the lack of spatial or morphological validation and the absence of homeostatic or intermediate microglial states limit mechanistic insight. The authors explicitly note that sorting for glial cells and increasing sample size will be necessary to resolve microglial heterogeneity and to determine whether DAM-like activation is a universal or context-dependent feature of human AD.

# summary for Emani 2024 (microglia)

**Quick Reference**

The PsychENCODE2 brainSCOPE study (Emani et al., Science 2024) profiled >2.8 million nuclei from 388 adult human prefrontal cortices, identifying 28 cell types including microglia. Microglia exhibited the least sequence conservation in their cis-regulatory elements and showed high cell-type specificity in gene expression and chromatin accessibility. Microglial gene regulatory networks (GRNs) and cell-cell communication patterns were prioritized in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, with microglia-excitatory neuron interactions notably altered in schizophrenia. Age-related chromatin changes in microglia stratified individuals into distinct age groups. Genetic and disease associations were mapped to microglial subpopulations using cell-type–specific eQTLs and regulatory networks.

**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Identification**  
Microglia were robustly identified as one of 28 canonical cell types in the prefrontal cortex. The study did not report further subclustering of microglia into distinct subtypes or states within this dataset, instead treating microglia as a single, harmonized population across individuals. However, microglia were included in all downstream analyses of cell-type–specific gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and regulatory networks.

**Defining Marker Genes and Functional Signature**  
Microglia were characterized by high expression of canonical microglial markers (not explicitly listed in the summary, but typically including genes such as CX3CR1, P2RY12, TMEM119, and SPI1). Chromatin accessibility at microglial marker loci was validated by snATAC-seq, confirming cell-type identity.  
<keyFinding priority='2'>Microglia-specific transcription factors included SPI1 and SPL1, which were highly enriched in microglia compared to other cell types.</keyFinding>  
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>  
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell-Type Specific Regulatory Elements and Conservation**  
Microglia exhibited the lowest sequence conservation among all cell types for their single-cell candidate cis-regulatory elements (scCREs), consistent with prior studies. These scCREs were highly cell-type–specific and largely distal to gene promoters.  
<keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial scCREs are less evolutionarily conserved, suggesting rapid regulatory evolution or adaptation.</keyFinding>  
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>  
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**  
The study did not highlight microglia as having the largest number of differentially expressed genes in disease or aging, but microglia were included in all DE analyses. Disease- and age-associated DE genes were mapped to microglia, but no unique microglial disease-associated subtypes were described.  
<keyFinding priority='3'>Microglial gene expression and chromatin accessibility patterns contributed to the identification of disease- and age-associated signatures, but no microglia-specific DE gene sets were emphasized as dominant drivers.</keyFinding>  
<confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>  
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Gene Regulatory Networks (GRNs) and Bottlenecks**  
Microglial GRNs were constructed using integrated snRNA-seq, snATAC-seq, and eQTL data. Microglial bottleneck transcription factors (key connectors in regulatory networks) were more cell-type–specific than network hubs, suggesting specialized regulatory roles.  
<keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial bottleneck TFs (e.g., SPI1) were enriched for cell-type–specific regulatory functions, distinguishing microglia from other glial and neuronal populations.</keyFinding>  
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>  
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell-Cell Communication**  
Microglia were grouped with other glial cell types in ligand-receptor network analyses. In schizophrenia, microglia-excitatory neuron interactions were increased, while microglia-oligodendrocyte interactions decreased, consistent with glial dysregulation in disease.  
<keyFinding priority='1'>Altered microglia-neuron and microglia-oligodendrocyte communication patterns were strongly associated with schizophrenia, implicating microglia in disease-related network rewiring.</keyFinding>  
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>  
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Aging and Chromatin Trajectories**  
Microglial chromatin accessibility patterns (scCREs) stratified individuals into distinct age groups, indicating that microglial epigenomic states are sensitive to aging.  
<keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial chromatin signatures were among the most age-informative, clustering individuals by age in tSNE space.</keyFinding>  
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>  
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Genetic Modulators and eQTLs**  
Microglia harbored cell-type–specific eQTLs (scQTLs), many of which were not detected in bulk tissue. These scQTLs linked genetic risk variants for brain disorders to microglial regulatory elements and gene expression.  
<keyFinding priority='1'>Microglial scQTLs provided unique insight into the genetic regulation of microglial gene expression, with implications for disease risk mapping.</keyFinding>  
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>  
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Validation**  
Microglial regulatory elements were functionally validated using STARR-seq and CRISPR perturbation, supporting the functional relevance of predicted enhancers and regulatory networks.

</findings>

<clinical>
Microglia are implicated as key mediators of disease-associated regulatory network changes and cell-cell communication in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. The increased microglia-excitatory neuron interactions in schizophrenia may contribute to disease pathophysiology, while microglial chromatin changes are sensitive markers of aging. Microglial scQTLs enable fine-mapping of genetic risk to microglial regulatory elements, suggesting potential for precision targeting of microglial pathways in neuropsychiatric disorders. However, the study does not identify novel microglial subtypes or states, instead emphasizing regulatory and network-level changes.
</clinical>

**Research Implications**

This study establishes microglia as a critical cell type for understanding the regulatory and genetic architecture of neuropsychiatric disorders and aging in the human brain. The absence of further microglial subclustering or identification of disease-specific microglial states in this large adult cohort contrasts with some prior studies that have described disease-associated microglial subpopulations (e.g., DAM, PAM). The authors focus on regulatory network rewiring, cell-cell communication, and genetic risk mapping, rather than on microglial heterogeneity per se. Open questions include whether finer subclustering or spatial transcriptomics might reveal additional microglial states, and how microglial regulatory evolution relates to disease susceptibility. The findings align with known models of microglial involvement in brain disorders but highlight the importance of regulatory and network-level analyses over simple cell-type proportion or marker-based subtyping.  
<contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>  
The authors note that, unlike some previous studies, they did not identify distinct disease-associated microglial subtypes, possibly due to differences in cohort composition, brain region, or analytical resolution.

Disease focus: Aging, psychiatric disorders (mainly schizophrenia), and convergence with neurodegenerative disease (notably Alzheimer’s disease, AD)
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on ~800,000 nuclei from the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) of 87 individuals (ages 26–84; 54 with psychiatric diagnoses, 33 neurotypical). Cell type annotation used label transfer from the Allen Brain Atlas and manual curation. Differential expression analyses were covariate-adjusted (disease status, sex, pH, RIN, PMI, batch, PC1). Replication was performed in an independent snRNA-seq dataset (32 individuals, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex). Validation included comparison to sorted microglia RNA-seq and bulk brain aging datasets.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Microglia proportions did not significantly change with age or psychiatric disease. Most cell types were stable, except for a decrease in OPCs and a trend toward increased oligodendrocytes with age.

**Differential Gene Expression in Microglia:**  
Microglia exhibited a high fraction of unique age-associated differentially expressed (DE) genes, indicating cell-type-specific aging signatures. Notably, the gene **MS4A6A** showed the highest log2 fold change (log2FC: 0.063 per year) among all DE genes in the dataset, and **HLA-DRB1** was also significantly upregulated with age in microglia. Both genes are implicated in immunity and AD risk.  
<keyFinding priority='1'>Microglial aging is marked by strong upregulation of MS4A6A and HLA-DRB1, genes linked to immune function and AD risk.</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Pathway Enrichment:**  
Upregulated microglial DE genes were enriched for humoral immune response, positive regulation of immune response, and cellular response to reactive oxygen species. Downregulated microglial DE genes were enriched for regulation of amyloid-β formation, suggesting a potential decline in amyloid clearance or altered homeostasis with age.
<keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial aging involves increased immune activation and decreased amyloid-β regulatory gene expression.</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Microglial Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
The study did not report further subclustering of microglia into distinct subtypes or states (e.g., homeostatic vs. disease-associated microglia) within the OFC. Instead, microglia were treated as a single cluster for DE and pathway analyses. The authors note that microglia had a high proportion of unique DE genes compared to other cell types, but do not describe discrete microglial subpopulations or state transitions.
<keyFinding priority='3'>No distinct microglial subtypes or state transitions were identified; microglia were analyzed as a single population.</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
No significant effects of psychiatric diagnosis, sex, or genetic risk (polygenic risk scores for schizophrenia or cross-disorder) on microglial aging signatures were detected. Age was the primary driver of microglial transcriptomic changes.  
<keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial aging signatures were not significantly modulated by psychiatric diagnosis or genetic risk scores.</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Gene Regulatory Networks:**  
No specific transcription factors or regulatory networks were highlighted for microglia.

**Cell-Cell Communication:**  
Not directly addressed for microglia.

**Spatial Analysis:**  
No spatial or morphological validation of microglial states was reported.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
Microglial age-related gene expression changes were highly concordant between the discovery and replication datasets (Spearman ρ = 0.92 for overlapping DE genes), supporting robustness across cohorts and cortical regions.  
<keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial aging signatures are robustly replicated across independent human cortical datasets.</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
GWAS enrichment analysis showed that age-associated microglial genes were significantly enriched for AD risk loci, but not for psychiatric disorder risk loci.  
<keyFinding priority='1'>Microglial age-upregulated genes are enriched for AD GWAS risk loci, linking microglial aging to AD susceptibility.</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
Microglia in the aging human OFC show a unique, cell-type-specific transcriptomic response characterized by upregulation of immune and AD risk genes (notably MS4A6A and HLA-DRB1) and downregulation of amyloid-β regulatory genes. These changes are robust across datasets and are not significantly altered by psychiatric diagnosis or genetic risk for psychiatric disorders. The enrichment of AD GWAS loci among age-upregulated microglial genes suggests that microglial aging may contribute to increased AD susceptibility, potentially via heightened immune activation and impaired amyloid regulation. However, these findings are associative and do not establish causality. No evidence was found for microglial subtypes or disease-associated microglial states in this dataset, nor for accelerated microglial aging in psychiatric disease.
</clinical>

---

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**  
Microglia in the aging human orbitofrontal cortex exhibit a unique transcriptomic signature dominated by upregulation of immune-related genes MS4A6A and HLA-DRB1, both linked to Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk. These changes are robustly replicated across independent datasets and are not significantly influenced by psychiatric diagnosis or genetic risk for psychiatric disorders. Age-upregulated microglial genes are enriched for AD GWAS loci, highlighting microglial aging as a potential contributor to AD susceptibility.

---

**Research Implications (≈150 words):**  
This study establishes that microglial aging in the human OFC is characterized by a distinct, cell-type-specific upregulation of immune and AD risk genes, with MS4A6A and HLA-DRB1 as prominent markers. The lack of evidence for microglial subtypes or disease-associated states (e.g., DAM, PAM) in this dataset contrasts with some prior reports in neurodegenerative or mouse models, a point not explicitly discussed by the authors. The robust enrichment of AD GWAS loci among age-upregulated microglial genes strengthens the link between microglial aging and AD risk, suggesting that interventions targeting microglial immune activation or amyloid regulation may be relevant for delaying or preventing AD onset. Open questions remain regarding the existence of microglial subpopulations in other brain regions, their spatial distribution, and their functional roles in disease progression. Further studies integrating spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, and functional assays are needed to clarify microglial heterogeneity and its impact on neurodegeneration and psychiatric comorbidity.

# summary for Fujita 2024 (microglia)

Quick Reference
A large-scale single-nucleus RNA-seq study of aged human neocortex (n=424) identified 899 microglial eGenes and revealed a microglia-specific cis-eQTL at the APOE locus (rs2288911), which increases APOE expression in microglia and is associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) but not classic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology, independent of APOEε4. Microglial eQTLs were often unique to this cell type, and microglia harbored the most AD GWAS colocalizations among all cell types. The APOE eQTL effect is modulated by the rs2288911 genotype, not by APOEε4 status.

- Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD), cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and related neurodegenerative/psychiatric disorders.
</metadata>

<methods>
- Single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) from 424 aged individuals (ROS/MAP cohorts).
- Pseudobulk eQTL mapping for major cell types and 64 subtypes; integration with whole-genome sequencing.
- Validation via chromatin state annotation, in vitro iPSC-derived models, and colocalization with GWAS.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and eGene Discovery**
Microglia comprised ~5% of nuclei, yielding 899 microglial eGenes. The number of eGenes detected was proportional to cell type abundance, but the slope for eGene discovery was steeper among subtypes, suggesting greater regulatory diversity at the subtype level. <keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial eQTL discovery was robust despite their relative rarity, but less than for neurons.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Microglial Subtypes and eQTL Specificity**
The study identified several microglial subtypes (e.g., Mic.2, Mic.3, Mic.4, etc.), but the main focus was on eQTL effects rather than transcriptomic state characterization. Many eGenes were unique to microglia or to specific microglial subtypes, not detected in bulk or other cell types. <keyFinding priority='1'>A substantial fraction of eGenes were only detected at the microglial subtype level, highlighting the importance of fine-grained analysis.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**APOE Microglia-Specific eQTL**
A novel cis-eQTL at the APOE locus (rs2288911) was identified as microglia-specific: this SNP increased APOE expression only in microglia, not in astrocytes or other cell types, despite APOE being expressed in multiple cell types. <keyFinding priority='1'>The rs2288911 variant is associated with increased APOE expression in microglia, but not with classic AD pathology (amyloid plaques or tau tangles); instead, it is strongly associated with increased CAA burden, independent of APOEε4 status.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

- The effect of rs2288911 on CAA persisted after adjusting for APOEε4 and showed no interaction with APOEε4, indicating an independent mechanism.
- Chromatin data revealed that rs2288911 lies in a microglia-specific enhancer region physically interacting with the APOE promoter, supporting cell-type specificity.

**Microglial eQTLs and Disease GWAS Colocalization**
Microglia harbored the largest number of AD GWAS colocalizations among all cell types, including known loci (e.g., BIN1) and several novel candidates. <keyFinding priority='1'>Microglial eQTLs showed the strongest overlap with AD risk loci, reinforcing microglia as a key cell type in AD genetic susceptibility.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathways**
While the study’s primary focus was eQTL mapping, it confirmed that microglial eGenes are enriched for immune and lipid metabolism pathways, consistent with known microglial biology in AD. <keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial eGenes are functionally linked to immune response and lipid processing, with APOE as a central node.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Validation and Replication**
- Microglial eQTLs showed modest overlap with previous bulk microglia eQTL studies, likely due to differences in methodology (nucleus vs. cytoplasmic RNA, brain region, sample size).
- Many eQTLs were not detected in bulk tissue, highlighting the necessity of cell-type-resolved approaches.
- Some eQTLs (e.g., MAPT) showed context-dependent directionality in iPSC-derived models, cautioning against direct extrapolation from in vitro systems.

**Modulators & Metrics**
- The APOE microglial eQTL effect is modulated by rs2288911 genotype, not by APOEε4.
- No significant heritability was found for microglial subtype proportions (fQTLs), suggesting that genetic control of microglial abundance is limited in this dataset.

**Cell-Cell Communication and Spatial Analysis**
- Chromatin conformation data (PLAC-seq, ChIP-seq) confirmed microglia-specific enhancer-promoter interactions at the APOE locus.
- No direct spatial transcriptomics or in situ validation of microglial subtypes was reported.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**
- The study is cross-sectional; no direct pseudotime or trajectory analysis for microglia was presented.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**
- Integration with GWAS and chromatin data provided mechanistic insight into cell-type-specific genetic risk.

</findings>

<clinical>
Microglia are strongly implicated as mediators of AD genetic risk, with cell-type-specific eQTLs at key loci such as APOE and BIN1. The microglial APOE eQTL (rs2288911) is associated with CAA but not with classic AD pathology, suggesting that microglial APOE expression may drive vascular amyloid deposition and related clinical outcomes (e.g., microhemorrhages, ARIA risk in anti-amyloid therapy). These findings refine the mechanistic understanding of how genetic variation influences microglial function and disease risk, and may inform risk stratification and therapeutic targeting in AD and CAA. <keyFinding priority='1'>Microglial eQTLs, especially at APOE, may serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets for CAA and AD-related vascular pathology.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</clinical>

Research Implications

This study establishes microglia as a central cell type for interpreting AD genetic risk, with many eQTLs and GWAS colocalizations unique to microglia or their subtypes. The discovery of a microglia-specific APOE eQTL (rs2288911) that is independent of APOEε4 and specifically associated with CAA, but not parenchymal amyloid or tau pathology, challenges the assumption that all APOE risk is mediated through classic AD mechanisms. This finding suggests distinct genetic and cellular pathways for vascular vs. parenchymal amyloid deposition. The study also demonstrates that many regulatory variants are only detectable at the cell subtype level, advocating for deeper, more granular single-cell studies in future research.

Open questions include the functional consequences of microglial APOE upregulation for CAA pathogenesis, the potential for targeting microglial APOE in therapy, and the need for spatial or morphological validation of microglial subtypes. The limited overlap with prior bulk microglia eQTL studies highlights the importance of methodological context. The authors note that while their findings align with the established role of microglia in AD, the identification of vascular-specific effects (CAA) represents a novel mechanistic insight. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

# summary for Fullard 2021 (microglia)

**Quick Reference**

Fullard et al. (Genome Medicine, 2021) performed single-nucleus RNA-seq on three brain regions from severe COVID-19 patients and controls, revealing that microglia in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) exhibit a pronounced disease-associated activation state. This state is marked by upregulation of genes involved in immune activation, phagocytosis, and mobility, with key transcriptional regulators (IRF8, ATF5, SPI1, TAL1) driving these changes. Microglial activation is most prominent in the PFC and is associated with the acute disease phase, independent of direct viral neuroinvasion.

</metadata>

<methods>
The study used droplet-based single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on postmortem brain tissue from 5 severe COVID-19 patients and 4 controls.

Viral presence was assessed by western blot, targeted RNA-seq, and RNA-FISH; none detected SARS-CoV-2 in brain tissue. Immunohistochemistry and gene regulatory network analyses complemented transcriptomic profiling.

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Microglia (Mic) were robustly identified by canonical markers (e.g., APBB1IP). No significant change in overall microglial proportion was reported in COVID-19 vs. control brains, but microglia in the PFC showed the most pronounced transcriptional changes among all cell types and regions analyzed.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
Subclustering identified seven microglial subclusters (Mic-1 to Mic-7). In the PFC, Mic-1 and Mic-2 showed significant, opposing changes in abundance between COVID-19 and controls, suggesting a disease-associated transition. Mic-2, which increases in COVID-19, is characterized by high expression of complement C3 and other activation markers, consistent with an inflammatory, disease-associated microglial state.

<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>  
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
Pseudo-temporal trajectory analysis of PFC microglia revealed a continuum from homeostatic to activated states, with COVID-19 cases skewed toward higher activation scores. Four gene expression patterns were identified: increasing (579 genes, e.g., FCGR2A), early transient (16 genes, e.g., CD83), late transient (36 genes, e.g., PRKCE), and decreasing (15 genes, e.g., LRP1B). The "increasing" cluster was most perturbed in COVID-19 and enriched for immune and apoptotic processes.

<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>  
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Gene Regulatory Networks:**  
Gene regulatory network analysis identified four transcription factors (IRF8, ATF5, SPI1, TAL1) as key regulators of the COVID-19 microglial activation signature in the PFC. These regulons were upregulated in COVID-19 and encompassed many DEGs.  
<keyFinding priority='1'>IRF8, ATF5, SPI1, and TAL1 are major transcriptional regulators of the disease-associated microglial state in COVID-19 PFC.</keyFinding>

**Genetic/Multi-omic Integration:**  
Transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS) using COVID-19 GWAS data found that genes downregulated in susceptible individuals were enriched in the microglial regulons activated in acute COVID-19, suggesting a potentially protective role for this activation.  
<keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial activation signatures in acute COVID-19 may be protective, as genetic susceptibility is linked to reduced expression of these regulons.</keyFinding>  
<confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>  
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Spatial/Morphological Validation:**  
No direct spatial or morphological validation of microglial subtypes was reported, but immunohistochemistry confirmed increased monocyte/macrophage infiltration in the choroid plexus, not in the PFC.

</findings>

<clinical>
Microglia in the PFC of severe COVID-19 patients adopt a disease-associated, inflammatory state characterized by upregulation of immune activation and phagocytic genes, driven by key transcription factors (IRF8, ATF5, SPI1, TAL1). This activation occurs in the absence of detectable SARS-CoV-2 in the brain, suggesting a response to systemic or peripheral immune signals rather than direct viral neuroinvasion. The findings imply that microglial activation may contribute to neuroinflammation and neurological symptoms in acute COVID-19, but genetic analyses suggest this response could be protective rather than deleterious. These microglial states and their regulators may serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets for COVID-19-associated neuroinflammation, though causal roles remain to be established.
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications**

This study provides a detailed atlas of microglial activation in the human brain during acute severe COVID-19, identifying a prominent disease-associated microglial state (Mic-2, C3-high) in the PFC. The transcriptional signature aligns with previously described "activated" or "inflammatory" microglial states in other neuroinflammatory conditions, but the authors note that the specific combination of upregulated genes and regulatory factors (IRF8, ATF5, SPI1, TAL1) may be distinctive for COVID-19. The absence of direct viral detection in the brain, alongside robust microglial activation, highlights the importance of systemic immune-brain communication. Open questions include the long-term fate of these microglial states, their precise functional impact on neuronal health, and whether similar activation occurs in milder or chronic COVID-19. The genetic data suggest that enhancing microglial activation could be beneficial, but further studies are needed to clarify causality and therapeutic potential. No explicit contradictions with prior microglial classification schemes are discussed, but the findings reinforce the concept of context-dependent, disease-associated microglial phenotypes.

Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), single-nucleus ATAC-seq, and snMultiome were performed on the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) from 84 aged human donors spanning the full spectrum of AD neuropathology. Spatial transcriptomics (MERFISH) and quantitative neuropathology were integrated. Cell types were mapped to a high-resolution BRAIN Initiative reference taxonomy, and a continuous pseudoprogression score (CPS) was derived from quantitative pathology to model disease severity. Findings were replicated in Brodmann area 9 (A9) from the same donors and harmonized with 10 additional public snRNA-seq datasets (n=707 donors).
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Disease Association**
The study identified several microglial subtypes in the MTG, mapped to a refined taxonomy (e.g., Micro-PVM_1, Micro-PVM_2, Micro-PVM_3, Micro-PVM_4, and subclusters). Among these, a disease-associated microglial subtype (Micro-PVM_3) was consistently increased in abundance with AD progression, as measured by the CPS, and replicated in independent datasets. This subtype is transcriptionally similar to previously described "disease-associated microglia" (DAM) and overlaps with Mic.12 and Mic.13 from Green et al. (2023) (<keyFinding priority='1'>DAM-like microglia (Micro-PVM_3) are robustly increased in AD and are a conserved disease-associated state across studies</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Subtype Characterization**
- **Micro-PVM_1**: Homeostatic microglia, expressing canonical markers (e.g., P2RY12, TMEM119, CX3CR1). These remain relatively stable in proportion across disease stages.
- **Micro-PVM_2**: Lipid-associated microglia, upregulating genes involved in lipid metabolism and phagocytosis (e.g., APOE, TREM2, LPL, CST7). This subtype shows modest increases in late-stage AD.
- **Micro-PVM_3 (DAM-like)**: Disease-associated microglia, defined by upregulation of inflammatory and phagocytic genes (e.g., APOE, CST7, SPP1, GPNMB, IL1B, C1QA/B, CD74, HLA-DRB5, FCGR1A/B, CTSD, LYZ, CSF1R, JAK3, IRF1/7, IFI16, STAB1, NINJ1). This subtype increases early in the CPS and is the most strongly AD-associated microglial state. It is also enriched for binding motifs of transcription factors RUNX1, IKZF1, NFATC2, and MAF, which are upregulated early in disease (<keyFinding priority='1'>Early upregulation of inflammatory and plaque-induced genes in DAM-like microglia, driven by specific TFs</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).
- **Micro-PVM_4**: Proliferative microglia, expressing cell cycle genes (e.g., MKI67, TOP2A). This subtype is present but not specifically expanded in AD.
- **Micro-PVM_2_1, Micro-PVM_2_3, Micro-PVM_3, Micro-PVM_4**: Additional subclusters, some with lipid-associated or proliferative signatures, but less clearly disease-associated.

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathways**
- Early in the CPS, microglia upregulate inflammatory (IL1B, CSF1R, JAK3), interferon response (IRF1, IRF7, IFI16), Fc receptor (FCGR1A/B, FCGR2A, FCGR3B), MHC class II (CD74, HLA-DRB5), and complement (C1QA/B) genes.
- Early upregulation of genes homologous to those induced by Aβ plaques (CSF1R, CTSC, C1QA/B, LY86, FCGR3A).
- Late in the CPS, further upregulation of cathepsins (CTSD, CTSS), LYZ, and APOE.
- Gene regulatory network analysis implicates RUNX1, IKZF1, NFATC2, and MAF as early drivers of the DAM program (<keyFinding priority='2'>TFs RUNX1, IKZF1, NFATC2, and MAF are upregulated early and regulate DAM gene expression</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**
- DAM-like microglia are increased in abundance in spatial transcriptomics data and localize to regions with high amyloid and tau pathology.
- Morphological validation is not detailed for microglia, but spatial transcriptomics supports their expansion in affected cortical regions.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**
- DAM-like microglia increase early in the CPS, preceding exponential increases in amyloid and tau pathology.
- The DAM program is initiated before overt neuronal loss and is sustained into late-stage disease.

**Genetic and Host Modulators**
- The DAM-like microglial state is present across donors with and without APOE4, but the study does not report a strong APOE4-specific enrichment in microglia.
- No significant sex differences are reported for microglial subtypes.

**Replication and Cross-study Integration**
- The DAM-like microglial state is replicated in Brodmann area 9 and in 10 additional public snRNA-seq datasets, showing strong cross-study consistency (<keyFinding priority='1'>DAM-like microglia are a robust, conserved feature of AD across multiple cohorts and brain regions</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).
- Minor discrepancies in oligodendrocyte responses are noted across datasets, but microglial findings are consistent.

**Cell-Cell Communication**
- Upregulation of cytokines and complement genes suggests increased potential for microglia-mediated neuroinflammation and crosstalk with astrocytes and other glia.

</findings>

<clinical>
Microglia, particularly the DAM-like (Micro-PVM_3) subtype, are strongly associated with AD progression. Their early expansion and upregulation of inflammatory, phagocytic, and plaque-induced genes suggest a central role in initiating and sustaining neuroinflammation and amyloid clearance responses. The early activation of specific transcriptional programs in microglia may contribute to both protective and detrimental effects, potentially mediating synaptic loss and neuronal dysfunction. The DAM signature is a robust, cross-region and cross-cohort feature of AD, supporting its utility as a biomarker and a potential therapeutic target. However, causal roles remain to be established, and the functional consequences of DAM expansion—whether beneficial (clearance) or harmful (chronic inflammation)—require further investigation. The study does not report microglial subtypes uniquely enriched by APOE4 or sex, suggesting the DAM program is a general feature of AD pathology.

**Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

A disease-associated microglial subtype (DAM-like, Micro-PVM_3) is robustly increased in Alzheimer’s disease, defined by upregulation of inflammatory and phagocytic genes (APOE, CST7, SPP1, GPNMB, IL1B, C1QA/B, CD74, HLA-DRB5, FCGR1A/B, CTSD, LYZ, CSF1R, JAK3, IRF1/7). This DAM program emerges early in disease progression, preceding overt neuronal loss, and is driven by transcription factors RUNX1, IKZF1, NFATC2, and MAF. The DAM-like state is conserved across brain regions and replicated in 10 independent AD cohorts, supporting its role as a core, generalizable feature of AD microglial response.

<methods>
This study used single-nucleus RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and multiome profiling of the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) from 84 aged human donors, spanning the full spectrum of AD neuropathology. A continuous pseudoprogression score (CPS) was derived from quantitative neuropathology, enabling fine-grained modeling of disease severity. Cell types were mapped to a high-resolution BRAIN Initiative reference taxonomy, and findings were validated in Brodmann area 9 (A9) and harmonized with 10 additional public snRNA-seq datasets (n=707 donors). Spatial transcriptomics (MERFISH) and gene regulatory network analyses were integrated for spatial and mechanistic validation.
</methods>

<findings>
The study identified a refined taxonomy of microglial subtypes in the human cortex, including homeostatic, lipid-associated, proliferative, and disease-associated (DAM-like) states. The most prominent disease-associated subtype, Micro-PVM_3, is transcriptionally similar to previously described DAMs and is robustly increased in AD, as measured by the CPS. This DAM-like state is defined by upregulation of inflammatory and phagocytic genes, including APOE, CST7, SPP1, GPNMB, IL1B, C1QA/B, CD74, HLA-DRB5, FCGR1A/B, CTSD, LYZ, CSF1R, JAK3, IRF1/7, IFI16, STAB1, and NINJ1 (<keyFinding priority='1'>DAM-like microglia (Micro-PVM_3) are robustly increased in AD and are a conserved disease-associated state across studies</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

Subtype breakdown:
- **Micro-PVM_1**: Homeostatic microglia, expressing P2RY12, TMEM119, CX3CR1, remain stable across disease stages.
- **Micro-PVM_2**: Lipid-associated microglia, upregulating APOE, TREM2, LPL, CST7, modestly increase in late-stage AD.
- **Micro-PVM_3 (DAM-like)**: Disease-associated microglia, upregulating inflammatory and phagocytic genes, increase early in the CPS and are the most strongly AD-associated microglial state. This subtype is also enriched for binding motifs of transcription factors RUNX1, IKZF1, NFATC2, and MAF, which are upregulated early in disease (<keyFinding priority='1'>Early upregulation of inflammatory and plaque-induced genes in DAM-like microglia, driven by specific TFs</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).
- **Micro-PVM_4**: Proliferative microglia, expressing cell cycle genes (MKI67, TOP2A), present but not specifically expanded in AD.
- **Micro-PVM_2_1, Micro-PVM_2_3, Micro-PVM_3, Micro-PVM_4**: Additional subclusters with lipid-associated or proliferative signatures, less clearly disease-associated.

Differential gene expression analysis revealed that microglia upregulate inflammatory (IL1B, CSF1R, JAK3), interferon response (IRF1, IRF7, IFI16), Fc receptor (FCGR1A/B, FCGR2A, FCGR3B), MHC class II (CD74, HLA-DRB5), and complement (C1QA/B) genes early in the CPS. Genes homologous to those induced by Aβ plaques (CSF1R, CTSC, C1QA/B, LY86, FCGR3A) are also upregulated early. In late CPS, further upregulation of cathepsins (CTSD, CTSS), LYZ, and APOE is observed.

Gene regulatory network analysis using snATAC-seq data identified RUNX1, IKZF1, NFATC2, and MAF as early upregulated transcription factors in microglia, predicted to regulate the DAM gene program (<keyFinding priority='2'>TFs RUNX1, IKZF1, NFATC2, and MAF are upregulated early and regulate DAM gene expression</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

Spatial transcriptomics confirmed the expansion of DAM-like microglia in regions with high amyloid and tau pathology. While detailed morphological validation is not provided for microglia, spatial transcriptomics supports their expansion in affected cortical regions.

The DAM-like microglial state increases early in the CPS, preceding exponential increases in amyloid and tau pathology and overt neuronal loss. This program is sustained into late-stage disease, suggesting a persistent role in AD pathogenesis.

The DAM-like microglial state is present across donors with and without APOE4, and no strong APOE4-specific enrichment is reported. No significant sex differences are observed for microglial subtypes.

Replication in Brodmann area 9 and 10 additional public snRNA-seq datasets demonstrates that the DAM-like microglial state is a robust, conserved feature of AD across brain regions and cohorts (<keyFinding priority='1'>DAM-like microglia are a robust, conserved feature of AD across multiple cohorts and brain regions</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Research Implications (≈150 words)**

This study establishes DAM-like microglia as a robust, conserved feature of AD across brain regions and cohorts, supporting their use as a reference for future studies. The early emergence of the DAM program, driven by specific transcription factors, highlights microglia as potential initiators of neuroinflammation and as therapeutic targets. The findings align with prior DAM/DAM2 models but extend them by demonstrating early activation and cross-cohort reproducibility. Open questions remain regarding the functional consequences of DAM expansion—whether these cells are primarily protective (clearance of pathology) or detrimental (chronic inflammation and synaptic loss). The lack of strong APOE4 or sex-specific enrichment suggests the DAM program is a general response to AD pathology. Future work should address the causal role of DAM microglia in disease progression, their interactions with other glial and neuronal populations, and the potential for targeting DAM-specific pathways for therapeutic intervention. No explicit contradictions with prior models are discussed by the authors.

# summary for Gerrits 2021 (microglia)

Quick Reference
Distinct microglial subtypes are associated with amyloid-β and tau pathology in Alzheimer’s disease. The study identifies two major AD-associated microglia states: AD1-microglia, which are phagocytic/activated and strongly correlated with amyloid-β plaque load, and AD2-microglia, which are enriched in regions with tau pathology and express neurotrophic and neuronal-interaction genes (notably GRID2). The abundance of these subtypes is modulated by the presence and regional distribution of amyloid-β and tau pathology.

</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions**
- Microglia comprised a major cluster (n=148,606 nuclei).
- In AD and amyloid-positive controls, homeostatic microglia subclusters were reduced, while AD1 and AD2 subclusters increased in abundance.
- Quantitative changes: AD1-microglia abundance strongly correlated with amyloid-β load in OC (amyloid-only region), but not in OTC (amyloid + tau region). AD2-microglia abundance correlated with tau load in OTC.

**Differential Gene Expression & Pathway Enrichment**
- AD1-microglia: Upregulation of phagocytic/activated genes (ITGAX, LPL, GPNMB, MYO1E, SPP1, MSR1, AXL, APOE, TREM2), downregulation of homeostatic markers (P2RY12, CX3CR1).
- AD2-microglia: Upregulation of neuronal-interaction and neurotrophic genes (GRID2, ADGRB3, DPP10, GPM6A, UNC5C, SLIT2, NRXN1), partial retention of homeostatic markers.
- Pathway analysis: AD1-microglia enriched for cell migration, phagocytosis, lipid localization, and cellular response to amyloid-β. AD2-microglia enriched for synapse organization and axonogenesis.

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization**

  <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **Other subtypes:** Inflammatory (subclusters 8, 11; CD163, IL1B, NFKB1), stress (subcluster 4; FOS, JUNB, HSPA1A/B), proliferative (subcluster 12; TOP2A, MKI67), all more abundant in AD but less central to pathology association.

**Modulators & Metrics**
- The presence and regional distribution of amyloid-β and tau pathology were the primary modulators of microglial state transitions.
- GWAS AD-risk genes (e.g., TREM2, APOE) were highly expressed in AD1-microglia, supporting genetic linkage to this state.
  <keyFinding priority='1'>AD1-microglia are enriched for AD GWAS risk genes, suggesting a genetic underpinning for the amyloid-associated microglial response.</keyFinding>
  <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
  <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Gene Regulatory Networks & Cell-Cell Communication**
- TREM2 and APOE upregulation in AD1-microglia suggest involvement of known microglial regulatory pathways.
- No direct ligand-receptor analysis reported.

**Spatial Analysis**
- Immunofluorescence confirmed spatial localization of AD1-microglia to amyloid plaques and AD2-microglia to tau-rich regions.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**
- Pseudotime analysis demonstrated a gradual transition from homeostatic to AD1-microglia, with intermediate loss of homeostatic markers and gain of phagocytic/activated genes.
- AD2-microglia appeared as a separate branch, not a direct progression from AD1.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**
- Integration with GWAS data highlighted the relevance of AD1-microglia to genetic risk for AD.

</findings>

<clinical>
- Disease-specific roles: AD1-microglia may mediate amyloid-β clearance or toxicity, while AD2-microglia may respond to tau pathology and neuronal stress.
- Mechanistic insights: The presence of distinct microglial states suggests that microglia contribute differentially to amyloid and tau pathology, potentially influencing disease progression.
- Therapeutic implications: Targeting microglial states (especially AD1) may offer new avenues for intervention, with AD1-microglia representing a genetically and pathologically validated therapeutic target.

Research Implications

This study provides strong evidence for the existence of two distinct, pathology-associated microglial states in human AD: AD1-microglia (amyloid-β-associated, phagocytic/activated, GWAS gene-enriched) and AD2-microglia (tau-associated, neurotrophic/neuronal-interaction, GRID2+). The clear separation of these states, their spatial validation, and their correlation with pathology load represent a significant advance over previous human snRNA-seq studies, which lacked the power or enrichment to resolve these subtypes. The findings align AD1-microglia with mouse DAM/ARM models, but AD2-microglia appear unique to human tau pathology. Open questions include the functional consequences of AD2-microglia, their potential neuroprotective or detrimental roles, and whether modulating these states can alter disease trajectory. The study’s explicit integration of GWAS data with microglial subtypes strengthens the case for microglia as a central player in AD pathogenesis. No explicit contradictions with prior models are discussed by the authors, but the identification of a tau-associated microglial state not seen in mouse models highlights the need for human-specific research.

# summary for Green 2024 (microglia)

1) **Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This large-scale single-nucleus RNA-seq study of aged human prefrontal cortex identifies 16 microglial subpopulations, with two lipid-associated states—Mic.12 (APOE+GPNMB+) and Mic.13 (APOE+GPNMB+TREM2+SPP1+)—playing distinct, prioritized roles in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression. Mic.12 is strongly age-associated and upstream of amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology, while Mic.13 is enriched in APOE ε4 carriers and mediates the effect of Aβ on tau pathology and cognitive decline. Both subtypes are validated morphologically and spatially, and their abundance increases specifically along the AD trajectory, distinguishing it from alternative brain aging.

Single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) was performed on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, BA9) tissue from 437 ROSMAP participants, spanning the full spectrum of aging and AD pathology. The study generated a comprehensive atlas of 1.65 million nuclei, identifying 95 cell subpopulations. Validation included bulk RNA-seq deconvolution (CelMod), single-molecule RNA FISH (smFISH), immunohistochemistry, and spatial transcriptomics.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Microglia comprised 86,673 nuclei, partitioned into 16 subpopulations. The overall proportion of microglia and their subtypes was largely stable across individuals, but specific subpopulations showed marked changes along disease trajectories.

**Differential Gene Expression & Pathway Enrichment:**  
Two lipid-associated microglial subpopulations, Mic.12 and Mic.13, were most strongly associated with AD pathology. Both express AD risk genes APOE and GPNMB, with Mic.13 also expressing TREM2 and SPP1.  
- **Mic.12**: Upregulates genes involved in endocytic vesicle regulation (PELI1, PELI2), MHC class II (HLA-DRA), and lipid metabolism.  
- **Mic.13**: Upregulates cell junction/adhesion/ECM genes (ADAM10, TGFBR1, SMAD3, PPARG), negative immune regulation, and exocytosis/phagocytosis genes (SCIN, WIPF3, PRKCE, MSR1).  
Both subtypes are enriched for DAM2 (disease-associated microglia) and human Aβ-associated microglial signatures.

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
- **Mic.1**: Proliferative (TOP2A+), cell cycle/DNA replication.
- **Mic.2–5**: Surveilling (CX3CR1+, P2RY12+), homeostatic.
- **Mic.6–8**: Reacting (TMEM163+), stress/inflammatory.
- **Mic.9–10**: Enhanced redox (FLT1+), ferric iron binding.
- **Mic.11**: Stress response (HSPH1, DNAJB1, NLRP1).

- **Mic.14**: Interferon response (IFI6+).
- **Mic.15**: Inflammatory (CCL3/4, NFKB1, IL1B, CD83), DAM2 signature.
- **Mic.16**: SERPINE1-expressing.

**Disease Trajectories and Subtype Dynamics:**  
Using the BEYOND computational framework, two major aging trajectories were reconstructed:  
- **prAD (progression to AD):** Monotonic increase in Mic.12 and Mic.13 proportions, paralleling Aβ and tau pathology and cognitive decline.  
- **ABA (alternative brain aging):** Stable/low Mic.12 and Mic.13, minimal AD pathology.

**Morphological & Spatial Validation:**  
smFISH and immunohistochemistry in independent samples confirmed that CPM+ (Mic.12) and TPRG1+ (Mic.13) microglia are distinct, non-overlapping populations. Both subtypes showed reduced compactness (less ramified, more activated morphology), with Mic.12 also showing increased eccentricity. Both were associated with higher AT8+ tau burden and with the proportion of morphologically activated microglia (PAM score), though the Mic.13 association was primary.

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
- **Mic.12**: Strongly associated with age, not APOE ε4.
- **Mic.13**: Not age-associated, but significantly enriched in APOE ε4 carriers.
- Both: Strongly associated with Aβ and tau pathology, and cognitive decline (Mic.13 > Mic.12).

**Gene Regulatory Networks:**  
Mic.13 upregulates ADAM10, TGFBR1, SMAD3, PPARG, TREM2—implicating regulatory modules in ECM, immune suppression, and AD risk.

**Cell-Cell Communication:**  
Both Mic.12 and Mic.13 upregulate phagocytosis and exocytosis genes, suggesting altered microglia-neuron and microglia-astrocyte interactions.

**Spatial Analysis:**  
Spatial transcriptomics confirmed co-localization of Mic.13 and disease-associated astrocytes (Ast.10) in prAD trajectory brains.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
Mic.12 increases early in prAD, preceding Aβ accumulation; Mic.13 increases downstream of Aβ, preceding tau and cognitive decline.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
Mic.13 is specifically enriched in APOE ε4 carriers, linking genetic risk to microglial state transitions.

</findings>

<clinical>
The study provides strong evidence that two distinct lipid-associated microglial subtypes, Mic.12 and Mic.13, play sequential and mechanistically distinct roles in AD pathogenesis. Mic.12 may drive early Aβ accumulation in an age-dependent manner, while Mic.13, influenced by APOE ε4, mediates the downstream effects of Aβ on tau pathology and cognitive decline. These findings suggest that targeting specific microglial states—rather than microglia as a whole—could offer stage-specific therapeutic opportunities. Mic.13, in particular, emerges as a candidate biomarker and therapeutic target for halting tau-mediated neurodegeneration in genetically at-risk individuals.
</clinical>

3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study establishes a high-confidence, stage-specific framework for microglial involvement in AD, distinguishing between age-driven (Mic.12) and genetically driven (Mic.13, APOE ε4) lipid-associated states. The sequential activation of these subtypes along the AD trajectory, and their distinct molecular and morphological signatures, provide a roadmap for future mechanistic studies and therapeutic targeting. The explicit causal modeling and spatial validation strengthen the link between microglial state transitions and AD pathology, moving beyond associative case-control designs. Open questions remain regarding the upstream triggers of Mic.12 activation, the reversibility of Mic.13 polarization, and the interplay with other glial and neuronal subtypes. The study’s findings align with, but also refine, prior DAM/ARM models by providing human-specific, trajectory-resolved evidence and highlighting the importance of genetic context (APOE ε4). No explicit contradictions with prior models are discussed by the authors. Future work should explore interventions that modulate these microglial states at defined disease stages and assess their impact on AD progression and resilience.

</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on post-mortem human entorhinal cortex from 6 AD and 6 age- and sex-matched controls (n=12 total). Nuclei were isolated, FACS-sorted, and sequenced using the 10x Genomics platform. Cell types were annotated using established marker gene sets. Subclustering and gene regulatory network analyses were performed, and findings were integrated with GWAS data. Validation was primarily computational; spatial or morphological validation was not reported for microglia.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Global Changes:**  
Microglia were robustly identified by canonical markers (HLA-DRA, CX3CR1, C1QB, CSF1R). The proportion of microglia did not show a dramatic shift between AD and control, but microglia displayed the most coordinated gene expression changes among cell types, alongside astrocytes and endothelial cells.

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathways:**  
AD microglia exhibited downregulation of homeostatic genes (CX3CR1, P2RY12, P2RY13) and genes involved in cell-cell adhesion (CD86, CD83), lipid response (LPAR6), and GPCR signaling (GPR183, LPAR6). These changes are consistent with a loss of homeostatic identity and a shift toward a disease-associated phenotype. Pathway enrichment highlighted upregulation of ribosomal and translation initiation processes, and a coordinated stress response (e.g., mitochondrial, heat shock, chaperone genes), which was also observed in other cell types.

**Microglial Subtype Identification and Characterization:**  
Five microglial subclusters (m1–m5) were identified:
- **m1:** AD-specific, characterized by upregulation of APOE (<keyFinding priority='1'>), and other AD risk genes (e.g., MS4A6A, TBXAS1, RIN3, INPP5D, HLA-DRB5, PLCG2, CSF3R). This subcluster showed a strong disease association and was enriched for inflammatory and phagocytic pathways. <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> (computational, no spatial validation). <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **m2–m5:** Control-enriched or mixed. m4 and m5 showed higher expression of APOC1 and HLA-DRB1, respectively, suggesting possible subpopulation-specific genetic susceptibility. <keyFinding priority='2'> These subclusters retained higher expression of homeostatic genes and were less associated with AD pathology. <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Disease-Associated Microglial State:**  
The m1 subcluster represents a disease-associated microglial (DAM)-like state, with upregulation of APOE and GWAS risk genes, and downregulation of homeostatic markers. This mirrors findings from mouse models and other human studies, supporting the existence of a conserved AD-associated microglial activation program. <keyFinding priority='1'> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> (strong cross-study concordance, see below). <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Integration with GWAS and Regulatory Networks:**  
Several AD GWAS genes (INPP5D, HLA-DRB5, PLCG2, CSF3R, MS4A6A, RIN3, TBXAS1) were highly specific to microglia and upregulated in the m1 subcluster. Regulatory network analysis implicated transcription factors such as AEBP1 and HIF3A in driving transitions toward the AD-associated microglial state. <keyFinding priority='2'> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Comparison with Other Studies:**  
The overlap of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in microglia between this study and Mathys et al. (2019) was significant, with >90% concordance in directionality, despite differences in brain region and cohort. <keyFinding priority='2'> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Host/Genetic Modulators:**  
The study included a range of APOE genotypes (E3/3, E3/4, E4/4, E2/4), but did not report genotype-specific microglial effects. However, the upregulation of APOE in AD microglia (m1) aligns with known genetic risk. <keyFinding priority='2'> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
Subclustering and trajectory analysis suggest a transition from homeostatic (control-enriched) to disease-associated (m1) microglial states in AD. This is supported by gene regulatory network modeling but lacks direct temporal or spatial validation. <keyFinding priority='2'> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
Microglia in the AD entorhinal cortex undergo a pronounced shift from homeostatic to disease-associated states, characterized by loss of canonical homeostatic markers and upregulation of AD risk genes, including APOE. The m1 subcluster, enriched for GWAS risk genes and inflammatory pathways, may contribute to AD pathogenesis by mediating neuroinflammation and impaired phagocytosis. These findings reinforce the central role of microglia in AD susceptibility and progression, and highlight the m1 state and its marker genes (e.g., APOE, MS4A6A, INPP5D) as potential therapeutic or biomarker targets. However, causal or temporal relationships remain to be established, and findings are primarily associative. <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**  
This study identifies a disease-associated microglial subcluster (m1) in the Alzheimer’s disease entorhinal cortex, marked by upregulation of APOE and multiple AD GWAS risk genes (e.g., MS4A6A, INPP5D, HLA-DRB5, RIN3, TBXAS1), and downregulation of homeostatic markers (CX3CR1, P2RY12). The m1 state is strongly associated with AD pathology and mirrors DAM-like states seen in mouse models. Regulatory network analysis implicates transcription factors such as AEBP1 and HIF3A in driving this transition. The m1 subcluster is enriched in individuals with AD, regardless of APOE genotype.

---

**Research Implications (≈150 words):**  
This work provides a high-resolution map of microglial heterogeneity in the human AD entorhinal cortex, confirming the existence of a conserved disease-associated microglial state (m1) with strong enrichment for AD genetic risk factors. The upregulation of APOE and other GWAS genes in m1 supports the hypothesis that microglia are central mediators of AD susceptibility. The findings align with DAM signatures described in mouse models and other human studies, strengthening the case for targeting microglial activation states in AD therapy. However, the study is cross-sectional and lacks spatial or functional validation of microglial subtypes. Open questions include the temporal dynamics of microglial state transitions, the impact of specific genetic backgrounds (e.g., APOE ε4), and the functional consequences of m1 activation. Future work should integrate spatial transcriptomics, in situ validation, and longitudinal sampling to clarify the causal role of microglial subtypes in AD progression. No explicit contradictions with prior models were discussed by the authors.

# summary for Herrero 2020 (microglia)

**Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

In Herrero et al. (2020, Molecular Autism), single-nucleus RNA-seq of postmortem human amygdala from ASD and control individuals revealed that microglia (MG) constitute a distinct cluster but show minimal transcriptional or proportional changes in ASD. No microglial subtypes with disease-associated signatures were identified, and no significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were reported for microglia in ASD versus controls. The study’s main findings center on excitatory neurons, with microglia remaining largely unaltered in ASD amygdala during the postnatal period examined. <keyFinding priority='3'>Microglia show no major ASD-associated transcriptional or compositional changes in this dataset.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

<methods>
The study combined datamining of ASD risk genes with single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of human amygdala. snRNA-seq was performed on microdissected amygdala tissue from five ASD and five control postmortem brains (ages 4–20 years). Cell clusters were annotated using canonical marker genes, and differential gene expression was assessed using MAST, controlling for diagnosis, age, sex, RIN, and postmortem interval. The dataset included 15 cell clusters, one of which was annotated as microglia (MG, C11).

The absence of microglial transcriptional or compositional changes in ASD amygdala suggests that, at least during the postnatal period (ages 4–20 years) and in this brain region, microglia may not play a prominent role in ASD pathophysiology.

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study provides a negative result for microglial involvement in ASD-related changes in the postnatal human amygdala, contrasting with reports of microglial activation in other brain regions or developmental windows in ASD. The lack of microglial subtypes or disease-associated states suggests that, in the amygdala and at the ages sampled, microglia remain largely homeostatic. This finding aligns with the study’s focus on neuronal and astrocytic changes as primary drivers of ASD pathology in this region. However, the authors acknowledge limitations, including the restricted age range (4–20 years) and the absence of fetal or early postnatal samples, where microglial roles might differ. Future studies with larger cohorts, earlier developmental stages, and spatial transcriptomics may be needed to fully exclude microglial contributions to ASD in the amygdala. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> The findings are consistent with the current literature on amygdala microglia in ASD, as discussed by the authors.

# summary for Hoffman 2023 (microglia)

**Quick Reference**

In a large-scale snRNA-seq study of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) using the dreamlet pseudobulk analysis framework, microglia from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex showed robust upregulation of **PTPRG** (log2FC = 1.52, p = 9.28e-28) in AD cases, with this effect highly specific to microglia and not observed in most other cell types. The effect was independent of batch and sex, and only modestly influenced by technical replicates, highlighting disease status as a key driver for this gene in microglia. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

<metadata>
Hoffman GE, Lee D, Bendl J, et al. "Efficient differential expression analysis of large-scale single cell transcriptomics data using dreamlet." Preprint, Research Square, May 2023. DOI: https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2705625/v1  
Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
</metadata>

<methods>
This study introduces the dreamlet R package for efficient pseudobulk differential expression analysis in large-scale single-cell/nucleus RNA-seq datasets. The authors generated a novel dataset of 1.4 million single nuclei from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, Brodmann area 9/46) of 150 AD cases and 149 controls (age >60), using 10x Genomics and nuclei hashing for multiplexing. Cell types were annotated via expert curation and machine learning, with microglia identified as "Micro_PVM." Technical replicates, batch effects, and donor-level covariates were rigorously modeled using precision-weighted linear mixed models.  
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Technical Reproducibility**  
Microglia (Micro_PVM) were robustly identified among 22 cell clusters. The median fraction of gene expression variance in microglia explained by subject was 50.9%, indicating high reproducibility across technical replicates. Only 143 genes in microglia had >5% variance explained by AD status, suggesting that disease effects are modest and require large sample sizes for detection. Batch effects (sample pool) explained >5% variance for 668 genes, but for most genes, batch effects were minimal. There was a significant correlation between batch effect variance and gene GC content, consistent with known PCR artifacts.

**Differential Gene Expression in Microglia**  
A total of 826 genes were differentially expressed in microglia between AD and controls at a study-wide FDR of 5%. The most prominent finding was the upregulation of **PTPRG** (protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor gamma), with a log2 fold change of 1.52 and a p-value of 9.28e-28. This effect was highly specific to microglia, with only minor changes in a few neuronal subtypes. Other notable upregulated genes included **DUSP10** and **ALCAM**, while **DPYD** was also highlighted.

<keyFinding priority='1'>The upregulation of PTPRG in microglia is the most significant disease-associated transcriptional change, with a large effect size and high specificity for microglia compared to other brain cell types.</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Pathway Enrichment and Functional Signatures**  
Gene set analysis revealed that microglia in AD showed specific upregulation of the **p38MAPK cascade**, a pathway implicated in microglial inflammatory responses. DUSP10, a top upregulated gene, is a component of this pathway. No evidence was presented for distinct microglial subtypes (e.g., DAM, homeostatic, or intermediate states) within this dataset; the analysis focused on the aggregate microglial population.

<keyFinding priority='2'>Microglia in AD exhibit upregulation of inflammatory signaling, particularly the p38MAPK cascade, supporting a role for microglial activation in disease.</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization**  
The study did not report further subdivision of microglia into distinct subtypes or states (e.g., homeostatic vs. disease-associated microglia) within the main text. Microglia were treated as a single cluster ("Micro_PVM") for differential expression and variance partitioning analyses. Thus, no explicit marker gene sets or functional roles for microglial subtypes were delineated beyond the disease-associated upregulation of PTPRG and inflammatory pathways.

**Modulators & Metrics**  
Variance partitioning showed that subject identity was the dominant source of expression variance in microglia, followed by batch effects for a subset of genes. Disease status explained a modest but significant fraction of variance for a limited set of genes, including PTPRG. Sex and age contributed minimally to variance in microglial gene expression.

**Gene Regulatory Networks and Cell-Cell Communication**  
No explicit analysis of gene regulatory networks or ligand-receptor interactions involving microglia was reported.

**Spatial Analysis and Morphological Validation**  
No spatial transcriptomics or immunohistochemical validation of microglial findings was presented.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**  
No pseudotime or trajectory analysis of microglial states was performed; the analysis was cross-sectional.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**  
The authors note that PTPRG is not located in a region with AD GWAS risk variants, suggesting its upregulation is likely reactive rather than genetically driven. No eQTL or multi-omic integration for microglia was reported.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
The findings reinforce the central role of microglia in AD, with PTPRG upregulation representing a robust, disease-specific transcriptional signature. While PTPRG is an inflammatory marker, its precise mechanistic role in AD remains unclear. The lack of genetic association suggests it may be a downstream or reactive marker of microglial activation. The upregulation of the p38MAPK cascade further implicates microglial inflammatory pathways in AD pathogenesis. These results may inform future biomarker development or therapeutic targeting of microglial activation, but causal or temporal relationships cannot be established from this cross-sectional data.  
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications**

This study provides strong evidence for disease-associated transcriptional activation of microglia in AD, particularly via upregulation of PTPRG and inflammatory signaling pathways. However, the lack of reported microglial subtypes or states (e.g., DAM, homeostatic) limits direct comparison to prior single-cell studies that have identified such heterogeneity. The authors explicitly note that PTPRG upregulation is consistent with two out of three previous human microglia transcriptome studies, but not with AD GWAS loci, highlighting a potential divergence between genetic risk and reactive transcriptional changes. Open questions remain regarding the functional consequences of PTPRG upregulation, its potential as a biomarker, and whether more granular microglial subtypes could be resolved with alternative clustering or spatial approaches. Future work should address the temporal dynamics of microglial activation, integrate genetic and multi-omic data, and validate findings with spatial or morphological methods.

<contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>  
The authors discuss that, unlike some previous studies, they do not identify PTPRG as an AD risk gene by GWAS, and that its upregulation may be reactive rather than causal. They also note that only a subset of prior microglial transcriptome studies report consistent PTPRG upregulation, suggesting some heterogeneity in the literature.

</metadata>

<methods>
This study performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex tissue from 1,384 donors (35.6% non-European ancestry), yielding 5.6 million high-quality nuclei. Nuclei were annotated into 8 major cell classes and 27 subclasses, including microglia. Genetic regulatory effects were mapped using cis- and trans-eQTL analyses, Bayesian meta-analysis for cell type specificity, and colocalization with GWAS risk loci. Dynamic eQTLs were assessed along developmental pseudotime trajectories.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Subtypes:**  
Microglia were robustly identified as a distinct cell class ("Micro") in the UMAP-based clustering (Fig. 1B). While the study does not subdivide microglia into finer subtypes based on transcriptional state (e.g., homeostatic vs. disease-associated microglia), it does analyze microglia as a unified class and in comparison to perivascular macrophages (PVM) at the subclass level. The number of eGenes (genes with significant eQTLs) detected in microglia is lower than in neurons but is substantial given their relative abundance (Fig. 1C, D).

**Genetic Regulation and Disease Association:**  
Microglia show strong enrichment for AD heritability, as determined by stratified LD score regression and mediation analysis (Fig. 2A, S6). This enrichment is specific to microglia among immune cell types and is not observed in neuronal subclasses for AD, underscoring the unique role of microglia in AD genetic risk. <keyFinding priority='1'>Microglial regulatory variants mediate a significant fraction of AD heritability, with high specificity compared to other cell types.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Colocalization of eQTLs and Disease Risk:**  
Colocalization analysis identifies 16 genes with shared regulatory and AD risk signals in immune cells, driven largely by microglia (Fig. 2D). Notable microglia-specific AD risk genes include BIN1 and EPHA1-AS1, both of which have eQTLs detected exclusively in microglia using a Bayesian approach (Fig. 3A). SORL1 is also highlighted as colocalizing with AD risk in microglia but not in PVMs or at the broader immune class level, demonstrating the added resolution of subclass analysis. <keyFinding priority='1'>BIN1 and EPHA1-AS1 are microglia-specific AD risk genes with regulatory effects not observed in other cell types.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell Type-Specific Regulatory Effects:**  
A total of 143 genes are identified as having microglia-specific regulatory effects at the subclass level (posterior probability > 0.5), placing microglia third after oligodendrocytes and astrocytes in terms of cell type-specific eQTLs (Fig. 3B). The study uses a composite Bayesian test to rigorously define cell type specificity, overcoming limitations of power and frequentist approaches. <keyFinding priority='2'>Microglia harbor a distinct set of regulatory variants, many of which are not shared with other glial or immune subclasses.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Dynamic Genetic Regulation:**  
Dynamic eQTL analysis across developmental pseudotime reveals that microglia, while less dynamic than neurons, show enrichment for genes involved in axonogenesis (Fig. 4D). The number of dynamic eGenes in microglia is modest compared to neurons but indicates that some genetic regulatory effects in microglia change with age or developmental stage. <keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial genetic regulation is developmentally dynamic for a subset of genes, potentially influencing age-related disease risk.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Trans-eQTLs and Regulatory Hubs:**  
Microglia (immune class) have 210 genes with significant trans-eQTLs, with limited overlap with other cell types (Fig. 5A). While the largest trans-regulatory hubs are found in oligodendrocytes, microglia-specific trans-regulatory effects are present and may contribute to disease risk, though the study notes limited power for mediation analysis in microglia. <keyFinding priority='3'>Microglia exhibit unique trans-regulatory effects, but their contribution to disease risk requires further elucidation.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>low</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Genetic and Demographic Modulators:**  
The study’s multi-ancestry design reveals that microglial regulatory architecture and eQTL detection are influenced by ancestry, with non-European donors contributing to increased discovery of microglia-specific eQTLs. This is particularly relevant for AD risk, which may be modulated by ancestry-specific regulatory variants. <keyFinding priority='2'>Ancestry is a significant modulator of microglial genetic regulation and AD risk variant discovery.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Gene Regulatory Networks and Cell-Cell Communication:**  
While the study does not deeply dissect microglial gene regulatory networks or ligand-receptor interactions, it does highlight the cell type-specificity of regulatory programs, as evidenced by the exclusive detection of certain eQTLs in microglia.

**Spatial and Morphological Validation:**  
No direct spatial or morphological validation of microglial subtypes is reported; the focus is on genetic and transcriptomic specificity.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
Dynamic eQTLs in microglia suggest that genetic regulation may shift with age, but the majority of dynamic effects are observed in neurons.

**Integration with GWAS and Multi-omic Data:**  
The integration of microglial eQTLs with AD GWAS loci provides mechanistic insight into how non-coding risk variants may act through microglial gene regulation.

</findings>

<clinical>
Microglia are confirmed as a central mediator of AD genetic risk, with multiple AD risk genes (e.g., BIN1, EPHA1-AS1, SORL1) showing regulatory effects specific to microglia. These findings reinforce the hypothesis that microglial dysfunction or altered gene regulation is a key driver of AD pathogenesis. The identification of microglia-specific eQTLs and their colocalization with AD risk loci suggests potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers. However, the study also highlights that not all AD risk genes act through microglia, emphasizing disease heterogeneity. <keyFinding priority='1'>Microglial regulatory variants are strong candidates for mediating AD risk and may inform precision medicine approaches, especially in diverse populations.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study establishes a foundational resource for dissecting cell type-specific genetic regulation in the human brain, with microglia emerging as a key mediator of AD genetic risk. The identification of microglia-specific eQTLs for major AD risk genes (e.g., BIN1, EPHA1-AS1) aligns with and extends previous models of microglial involvement in neurodegeneration. The use of a multi-ancestry cohort addresses a critical gap in the field and suggests that ancestry-specific regulatory variants may underlie population differences in AD risk. Open questions remain regarding the functional consequences of these regulatory variants, the existence of finer microglial subtypes or states (e.g., DAM, homeostatic), and the interplay between dynamic regulation and disease onset. The lack of spatial or morphological validation of microglial subpopulations is a limitation, as is the focus on the prefrontal cortex. Future work should integrate multi-omic and spatial data, explore microglial heterogeneity in other brain regions, and experimentally validate candidate regulatory variants. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

This study used single-nucleus RNA-seq of human temporal cortex to profile the gliovascular unit in Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with a focus on vascular and astrocytic clusters. Microglia were identified as two distinct clusters but showed minimal transcriptional perturbation in AD compared to other cell types. No major disease-associated microglial subtypes or significant changes in microglial proportions were reported. The most critical findings center on the lack of robust AD-associated microglial activation or subtype emergence, in contrast to pronounced pericyte and astrocyte changes. Host factors (age, sex, APOE) did not significantly modulate microglial states in this dataset.

Microglia: Cell Type Proportions and Subtypes
The study identified two microglial clusters among 35 total clusters (3% of nuclei). These clusters were annotated using canonical microglial markers (e.g., C3, CSF1R, CD74). The microglial clusters were distinct from other glial and vascular populations, as confirmed by marker expression and UMAP visualization.

**Cell Type Proportions:**  
No significant differences in the proportion of microglial nuclei between AD and control brains were reported. Microglial cluster proportions were not associated with diagnosis, age, sex, APOE ε4 status, or neuropathological measures (Braak stage, Thal phase, TDP-43 aggregates).

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
No evidence for microglial state transitions along aging or disease progression trajectories was presented. The study did not perform pseudotime or trajectory analyses for microglia.

**Host/Genetic Modulators:**  
No significant effects of age, sex, or APOE genotype on microglial cluster proportions or gene expression were observed.

**Gene Regulatory Networks, Cell-Cell Communication, and Multi-omic Integration:**  
The study’s cell-cell communication analyses (NicheNet) focused on astrocyte-vascular interactions. No microglial ligand-receptor or regulatory network findings were highlighted.

**Comparison to Prior Data:**

Microglia in Disease Context
The study concludes that, in the temporal cortex, microglia do not show major AD-associated activation or emergence of disease-associated subtypes, in contrast to the pronounced transcriptional changes in pericytes and astrocytes. This suggests that microglial responses may be less prominent or regionally restricted in AD, or that vascular and astrocytic dysfunctions are more central to BBB breakdown in this context. The lack of microglial activation signatures implies limited utility of microglial markers as biomarkers or therapeutic targets for BBB dysfunction in the temporal cortex, at least in late-stage AD.

<researchImplications>
This study highlights a striking lack of AD-associated microglial activation or emergence of disease-associated subtypes in the temporal cortex, despite robust vascular and astrocytic perturbations. This finding raises important questions about the regional heterogeneity of microglial responses in AD and suggests that microglial activation may be less central to BBB dysfunction in this brain region or disease stage. The absence of DAM-like states contrasts with prior reports from other cortical areas (e.g., prefrontal cortex, entorhinal cortex), as explicitly discussed by the authors. Future research should address whether microglial responses are more prominent in other regions, at earlier disease stages, or under different pathological contexts. Integration with spatial transcriptomics and functional assays may help clarify the role of microglia in BBB integrity and AD progression. The study’s findings also caution against generalizing microglial activation signatures across brain regions or disease stages in AD.

# summary for Jakel 2019 (microglia)

1) **Quick Reference**

This study (Jäkel et al., Nature 2019) used single-nucleus RNA-seq of human white matter to reveal that microglia, while present among immune cell clusters, were not the primary focus; instead, the work provides a detailed atlas of oligodendrocyte heterogeneity in multiple sclerosis (MS). Microglia were identified as a distinct cluster (AIF1+, CD74+), but the main findings concern oligodendroglial subtypes and their disease-associated shifts. No major microglial subtypes or disease-specific microglial states are reported or analyzed in depth in this paper.

2) **Detailed Summary**

<metadata>
Jäkel S, Agirre E, Mendanha Falcão A, van Bruggen D, Lee KW, Knuesel I, Malhotra D, ffrench-Constant C, Williams A, Castelo-Branco G. "Altered human oligodendrocyte heterogeneity in multiple sclerosis." Nature. 2019 May 9;566(7745):543–547. doi:10.1038/s41586-019-0903-2.
Disease focus: Multiple Sclerosis (MS)
</metadata>

<methods>
The study performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on post-mortem human white matter from five controls and four progressive MS patients, using the 10x Genomics platform. Tissue regions included normal-appearing white matter (NAWM) and various MS lesion types. Data integration and clustering were performed with Seurat and canonical correlation analysis (CCA). Cell type identities were validated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and in situ hybridization (ISH).
</methods>

<findings>
Microglia were identified as a distinct cluster in the snRNA-seq dataset, marked by canonical genes such as AIF1 (IBA1) and CD74, and visualized in tSNE projections (see Figure 1g). However, the study does not report further subclustering, differential gene expression, or disease-associated states within the microglial population. The main immune cell findings relate to the presence of macrophages and immune oligodendroglia (imOLG), the latter expressing some microglial/immune markers (e.g., CD74, HLA.DRA, C3, PTPRC) and showing proximity to microglia in transcriptomic space.

No quantitative changes in microglial proportions between control and MS samples are reported, nor are there analyses of microglial activation states, marker gene shifts, or pathway enrichments specific to microglia. The immune cell cluster, including microglia, is noted to reflect immunological infiltration in MS, but the focus is on the oligodendrocyte lineage.

The only indirect microglial-related finding is the identification of imOLG, a population of oligodendroglia expressing immune genes (CD74, HLA.DRA, C3, PTPRC) and closely associated with microglia in tSNE space. This population is enriched in MS tissue and may represent a disease-associated state with immunological features, but it is not a microglial subtype per se.

No spatial, morphological, or temporal (pseudotime) analyses are presented for microglia. The study does not discuss microglial gene regulatory networks, ligand-receptor interactions, or genetic modulators (e.g., MS risk variants) in relation to microglia.

<keyFinding priority='2'>
A population of immune oligodendroglia (imOLG) expresses immune/microglial markers (CD74, HLA.DRA, C3, PTPRC) and is enriched in MS, suggesting cross-lineage immune activation, but this does not represent a microglial subtype.
</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
The study does not provide direct disease-specific mechanistic insights into microglia in MS. The presence of microglia and immune cells is consistent with known CNS inflammation in MS, but no novel microglial subtypes, activation states, or biomarkers are proposed. The enrichment of imOLG with immune features may suggest altered glial cross-talk or immune activation in MS, but the implications for microglial function remain unexplored in this work.
</clinical>

---

3) **Research Implications**

This study does not advance the classification or understanding of microglial heterogeneity in MS, as its primary focus is on oligodendrocyte lineage diversity. The identification of microglia as a distinct cluster with canonical markers is consistent with prior single-cell/nucleus studies, but no new microglial subtypes or disease-associated states are described. The enrichment of immune oligodendroglia expressing microglial/immune genes in MS raises questions about glial plasticity and immune activation, but the functional relationship to microglia is not dissected here.

Open questions for microglia in MS—such as the existence of disease-associated microglial states, their transcriptional signatures, and their roles in demyelination or repair—remain unaddressed in this dataset. The findings align with established cell type identification schemes but do not contradict or extend current models of microglial heterogeneity. Future studies with a focus on microglia, deeper subclustering, and integration with spatial or functional data will be needed to clarify microglial roles in MS pathogenesis.

# summary for Johansen 2023 (microglia)

**Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This large-scale snRNA-seq study of 75 adult human cortical samples reveals that microglia exhibit substantial interindividual variation in gene expression, with inflammatory response genes (e.g., CCL3, CCL4, SOCS3, TNFAIP3) being especially variable across donors. Microglial gene expression variability is only partially explained by factors such as age, sex, ancestry, or disease status, with much remaining unexplained. Moderate IBA1 reactivity and variable abundance of reactive microglia were observed histologically. These findings establish a baseline for microglial heterogeneity in the adult cortex and highlight the influence of donor-specific factors on microglial states.

Disease focus: Baseline adult human cortex, with reference to epilepsy, tumor, and dementia cohorts.
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on cortical tissue from 75 adult neurosurgical donors (middle temporal gyrus, frontal cortex, others), with paired whole-genome sequencing (WGS). Cell type annotation was based on a reference taxonomy, and quality control included removal of low-quality nuclei and doublets. Morphological validation included IBA1 immunohistochemistry for microglial reactivity in a subset of cases.
</methods>

<findings>
Microglia, annotated as "Micro-PVM" in the study, were robustly identified across all donors. The study focused on interindividual variation in both cell type abundance and gene expression, with microglia standing out among non-neuronal types for their high degree of donor-specific transcriptional variability.

**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Microglial abundance did not show significant systematic differences by sex, age, or brain region in the main cohort. However, moderate variability in microglial abundance and reactivity was observed histologically (IBA1 pathology scores 1–2 out of 3 in ~1/3 of cases), suggesting the presence of reactive microglia in some donors. <keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial abundance and reactivity are moderately variable across individuals, with some donors showing increased IBA1 staining.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression & Pathway Enrichment:**  
Microglia exhibited a high fraction of "high-variance" genes—genes whose expression varied more between donors than within donors. Notably, genes associated with inflammatory responses (e.g., CCL3, CCL4, SOCS3, TNFAIP3, CCL4L2, CCL3L3) were among the most variable in microglia. Gene ontology analysis confirmed enrichment for "inflammatory response" pathways among these variable genes. <keyFinding priority='1'>Inflammatory response genes are the most donor-variable gene set in microglia, indicating substantial heterogeneity in microglial activation states across individuals.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
The study did not report further subclustering of microglia into distinct subtypes (e.g., homeostatic vs. disease-associated microglia) within the main cohort. Instead, microglia were treated as a single transcriptional cluster ("Micro-PVM"), but with substantial interindividual heterogeneity in gene expression. The presence of reactive microglia was inferred from both transcriptomic signatures (upregulation of inflammatory genes) and moderate IBA1 immunoreactivity in a subset of donors. <keyFinding priority='2'>Microglia were not subdivided into discrete subtypes, but donor-specific activation states were evident from both transcriptomic and histological data.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
Variation in microglial gene expression was only partially explained by measured covariates (age, sex, ancestry, disease status, batch), with a large residual component remaining. The study's variance partitioning analysis showed that, for microglia, donor identity explained a substantial fraction of gene expression variance, especially for inflammatory genes, but much variance remained unexplained. <keyFinding priority='2'>Donor identity is a major driver of microglial gene expression variability, but known demographic and clinical factors account for only a minority of this effect.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Gene Regulatory Networks:**  
No specific transcription factors or regulatory networks were highlighted as drivers of microglial heterogeneity in this study.

**Cell-Cell Communication:**  
The study did not report ligand-receptor or cell-cell communication analyses specific to microglia.

**Spatial Analysis:**  
Moderate IBA1 immunoreactivity was observed in a subset of donors, supporting the presence of reactive microglia. No spatial transcriptomics or in situ hybridization was performed.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
In the main adult cohort, microglial gene expression variability was not strongly associated with age or disease status. However, in a comparison with aged/demented donors from the SEA-AD cohort, microglia in dementia showed increased variability in abundance and gene expression, but this was not the focus of the main analysis.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
The study performed eQTL analysis across all cell types, but did not highlight any microglia-specific eQTLs or genetic associations.

</findings>

<clinical>
Microglia in the adult human cortex display substantial interindividual heterogeneity in inflammatory gene expression, even in the absence of overt disease. This variability is only partially attributable to demographic or clinical factors, suggesting that unmeasured environmental or stochastic influences may play a major role. The presence of reactive microglia in some donors, as indicated by both transcriptomic and histological data, may have implications for interpreting microglial states in disease versus health. These findings provide a critical baseline for future studies of microglial activation in neurological disorders and highlight the need for large, well-controlled cohorts to distinguish disease-specific changes from normal interindividual variation. <keyFinding priority='1'>Establishing the extent of baseline microglial heterogeneity is essential for interpreting disease-associated microglial phenotypes in future studies.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study establishes that microglia in the adult human cortex are highly heterogeneous at the transcriptomic level, with inflammatory response genes being particularly variable across individuals. The lack of discrete microglial subtypes in this dataset (e.g., homeostatic vs. disease-associated microglia) may reflect the relatively healthy status of the cohort or limitations in resolution, but the pronounced donor-specific activation signatures underscore the importance of accounting for baseline variability in future disease studies. The findings align with prior reports of microglial plasticity but extend them by quantifying the magnitude and sources of interindividual variation in a large, well-annotated cohort. Open questions include the environmental or genetic drivers of this variability, the functional consequences for brain health, and how these baseline states interact with disease processes. The study does not report contradictions with prior models but emphasizes the need for caution in attributing microglial activation solely to disease without considering normal variation. Future work should aim to resolve microglial subtypes at higher resolution and integrate spatial, functional, and genetic data to clarify the determinants and consequences of microglial heterogeneity. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This study used single-nucleus RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics to profile the human substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) in Parkinson’s disease, identifying 10 dopaminergic neuron subtypes and characterizing all major cell classes, including microglia. Among microglia, a GPNMB+ disease-associated subtype was proportionally increased in PD/LBD, paralleling findings in Alzheimer’s disease. This microglial activation was robust to sample size and technical variation, and was not the primary locus of PD genetic risk, which was instead concentrated in vulnerable DA neurons. The GPNMB+ microglia subtype was associated with neurodegeneration but not with specific genetic or demographic drivers.

---

**Detailed Summary (≈800–1000 words)**

<methods>
The authors performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on postmortem human SNpc tissue from 8 neurotypical controls and 10 individuals with PD or Lewy body dementia (LBD), generating 387,483 nuclei profiles, including all major brain cell types. They also used Slide-seq spatial transcriptomics for anatomical localization. Microglia were identified and subclustered based on canonical markers. Validation included in situ hybridization and robust computational downsampling.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Microglia were robustly identified among the seven major cell classes in the SNpc. In the disease (PD/LBD) versus control comparison, microglia as a broad class did not show the largest proportional change (that was observed in DA neurons), but a specific microglial subtype was significantly increased in PD/LBD.

**Microglial Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
The key microglial finding was the identification of a GPNMB+ microglia subtype (MG_GPNMB_SULT1C2), which was proportionally increased in PD/LBD compared to controls (<keyFinding priority='2'>). This subtype was defined by upregulation of GPNMB and SULT1C2, genes previously associated with disease-associated microglia (DAM) in Alzheimer’s disease (<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>). The increase in this subtype was robust to downsampling, remaining significant even when the dataset size was reduced to one-sixth of the original (<keyFinding priority='2'>). The authors note that GPNMB+ microglia have been repeatedly identified as markers of neurodegeneration-associated microglia in other neurodegenerative contexts, particularly AD (<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

Other microglial subtypes were identified but did not show significant proportional changes or disease associations.

**Differential Gene Expression:**  
The GPNMB+ microglia subtype showed upregulation of GPNMB and SULT1C2, consistent with a DAM-like phenotype. The study did not report extensive differential expression analyses for other microglial subtypes.

**Pathway Enrichment:**  
While the paper does not provide a detailed pathway analysis for microglia, the upregulation of GPNMB and SULT1C2 is consistent with previously described DAM programs, which are associated with phagocytosis, lipid metabolism, and neuroinflammatory responses.

**Spatial Analysis:**  
Spatial transcriptomics (Slide-seq) was used primarily for DA neuron localization, not for microglia. No specific spatial or morphological validation of microglial subtypes was reported.

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
No significant associations were reported between microglial subtypes and host or genetic factors (age, sex, APOE, or PD GWAS risk variants). The enrichment of PD heritability was not significant in microglia, in contrast to DA neurons (<keyFinding priority='1'> for DA neurons, not microglia; <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Gene Regulatory Networks:**  
No microglia-specific gene regulatory network analysis was reported.

**Cell-Cell Communication:**  
No ligand-receptor or cell-cell communication analysis was performed for microglia.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
No pseudotime or trajectory analysis was reported for microglia.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
PD GWAS risk was not enriched in microglial marker genes or subtypes, in contrast to findings in Alzheimer’s disease where microglia are a major locus of genetic risk (<contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>: The authors explicitly note that, unlike AD, PD heritability is not concentrated in microglia, but in DA neurons).

</findings>

<clinical>
The study suggests that microglial activation, particularly the expansion of a GPNMB+ DAM-like subtype, is a consistent feature of neurodegeneration in PD/LBD, paralleling similar findings in AD. However, the lack of PD genetic risk enrichment in microglia indicates that microglial activation is likely a secondary, non-cell-autonomous response to neuronal degeneration rather than a primary driver of disease (<keyFinding priority='2'>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>). This has implications for therapeutic strategies targeting microglia in PD, suggesting that such interventions may modulate disease progression or neuroinflammation but are unlikely to address the primary cause of neuronal loss.
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study reinforces the concept that microglial activation, and specifically the emergence of a GPNMB+ DAM-like microglial state, is a conserved response to neurodegeneration across diseases, including PD and AD. However, the explicit lack of PD genetic risk enrichment in microglia, in contrast to AD, highlights a fundamental difference in disease mechanisms: in PD, microglial changes are likely reactive rather than causative. This finding aligns with prior models of DAM in AD but diverges in the genetic architecture of risk. Open questions remain regarding the functional consequences of GPNMB+ microglia in PD—whether they are neuroprotective, neurotoxic, or both at different stages—and whether modulating this state could alter disease progression. The study’s microglial subtypes are consistent with previously described DAM classifications, supporting the robustness of these states across diseases and platforms. Future work should address the temporal dynamics, spatial localization, and functional roles of microglial subtypes in PD, as well as their potential as biomarkers or therapeutic targets.

<contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>: The authors explicitly discuss that, unlike in AD, PD genetic risk is not enriched in microglia, suggesting a cell-intrinsic vulnerability in DA neurons rather than a primary microglial etiology.

<methods>
This study employed multimodal single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and surface protein profiling (CITE-seq) on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from MS patients (RRMS, PPMS) and matched controls. Longitudinal sampling included RRMS patients before and during natalizumab (anti-VLA4) treatment. Spatial RNA sequencing was performed on post-mortem brain tissue from SPMS patients and controls to localize immune cell populations. The analysis integrated 497,705 single-cell transcriptomes and 355,433 surface protein profiles from 71 PBMC samples, and ~85,000 spatial transcriptomes from 20 brain slices.
</methods>

<findings>
**Microglia:**
The study’s primary focus was on peripheral immune cells, particularly CNS-homing T cells, rather than resident CNS microglia. Microglia were not a central subject of the main analyses, and the paper does not report significant findings regarding microglial heterogeneity, subtypes, or disease-associated states in MS.

- **Cell Type Proportions:**  
  Microglia were not directly quantified or analyzed for proportional changes in either blood or brain tissue. The spatial RNA-seq analysis specifically excluded microglia from the T cell signature enrichment, confirming that the identified T cell (T09) signature was not present in microglia or astrocytes (see Figure 6B and associated text).

- **Differential Gene Expression & Pathway Enrichment:**  
  No microglia-specific differential gene expression or pathway enrichment analyses were reported. The CNS-homing T cell signature was validated to be absent from microglia, using a public single-nucleus RNA-seq dataset of MS brain tissue.

- **Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
  The study did not identify or characterize microglial subtypes or states. Instead, it focused on distinguishing T cell subtypes, particularly the CD161+/LTB+ (KLRB1+/LTB+) T09 cluster, and ensured that this signature was not confounded by microglial gene expression.

- **Spatial Analysis:**  
  Spatial transcriptomics was used to localize T09 T cells in MS brain tissue, with explicit validation that the T09 signature did not overlap with microglial or astrocytic regions. There is no mention of microglial spatial heterogeneity, activation, or association with demyelinated lesions in this dataset.

- **Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
  No microglial pseudotime, trajectory, or disease progression analyses were performed or reported.

- **Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
  No eQTL, GWAS, or multi-omic integration was performed for microglia.

- **Contradiction/Conflict:**  
  The authors explicitly state that the T09 T cell signature is not enriched in microglia or astrocytes, referencing a public dataset (Schirmer et al., Nature 2019) for validation. No contradictions or novel findings regarding microglia are discussed.
  <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Summary:**  
The study provides no evidence for significant findings regarding microglial subtypes, activation states, or their role in MS pathogenesis. All major findings pertain to peripheral and CNS-infiltrating T cells, with microglia only referenced as a negative control for T cell signature specificity.
</findings>

<clinical>
Microglia are not implicated in the disease mechanisms or therapeutic strategies proposed in this study. The authors’ mechanistic and translational focus is on CNS-homing CD4+ T cells (T09), not on resident microglia. No microglia-derived biomarkers or therapeutic targets are suggested.

---

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**  
This study does not report significant findings on microglia in multiple sclerosis. Microglia were used as a negative control to validate the specificity of a pathogenic CNS-homing T cell (T09) signature, ensuring it was not present in resident CNS cells. No microglial subtypes, marker genes, or disease associations were identified or discussed. The main findings center on CD161+/LTB+ T cells, not microglia. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

---

**Detailed Summary (≈800–1000 words):**  
The paper by Kaufmann et al. (2021) investigates the role of CNS-homing T cells in the progression of multiple sclerosis (MS), using a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing, surface protein profiling, and spatial transcriptomics. The central hypothesis is that progressive MS may be driven by the accumulation and residence of pathogenic immune cells behind the blood-brain barrier, beyond the reach of current immunomodulatory therapies.

The study’s experimental design centers on the identification and characterization of a specific CD4+ T cell population (T09, CD161+/LTB+) in the blood and brains of MS patients. The authors use natalizumab treatment to trap CNS-homing cells in the blood, enabling their molecular profiling. They then track these cells in untreated MS patients and localize them in post-mortem brain tissue using spatial RNA sequencing.

**Microglia:**
Despite the comprehensive single-cell and spatial transcriptomic profiling, microglia are not a focus of the study. The authors do not report any findings regarding microglial heterogeneity, subtypes, or activation states in MS. Instead, microglia are referenced solely as a negative control in the validation of the T09 T cell signature. Specifically, the authors use a publicly available single-nucleus RNA-seq dataset (Schirmer et al., Nature 2019) to confirm that the T09 signature is not enriched in microglia or astrocytes, ensuring the specificity of their T cell findings.

There is no discussion of microglial marker genes, functional states (e.g., homeostatic, disease-associated), or their spatial distribution in MS lesions. The spatial transcriptomics analysis is focused on the localization of T09 T cells in white and gray matter, with no mention of microglial involvement or changes.

The absence of microglial findings is explicitly addressed in the methods and results, where the authors state that the T09 signature was tested and found not to be present in microglia or astrocytes. This serves to strengthen the specificity of their T cell-centric conclusions but does not provide new insights into microglial biology in MS.

**Contradiction/Conflict:**  
No contradictions or departures from prior microglial data are discussed. The authors’ use of microglia as a negative control is consistent with existing knowledge of cell type-specific gene expression in the CNS. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Summary:**  
In summary, this study does not contribute new information on microglial subtypes, activation, or their role in MS. Microglia are only referenced to validate the specificity of T cell findings, and no microglia-focused analyses or results are presented.

---

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words):**  
The lack of microglial findings in this study highlights the specificity of the authors’ approach to dissecting peripheral immune cell contributions to MS progression. While the paper advances our understanding of CNS-homing T cells as potential therapeutic targets, it leaves open the question of how resident CNS cells, particularly microglia, interact with infiltrating lymphocytes and contribute to neurodegeneration in progressive MS. Future studies integrating high-resolution single-nucleus RNA-seq of brain tissue, with a focus on microglial heterogeneity and their crosstalk with T cells, will be essential to build a more complete picture of MS pathogenesis. The current study’s negative findings for microglia are consistent with its design and do not contradict existing models, but they underscore the need for dedicated microglia-centric investigations in MS. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

# summary for Kousi 2022 (microglia)

1) **Quick Reference**

This study (Kousi et al., bioRxiv 2022) provides a single-cell map of somatic mosaicism in Alzheimer’s dementia (AlzD), revealing that microglia exhibit a moderate mutational burden compared to other glial and neuronal cell types, but do not show significant disease-specific enrichment or distinct subtypes based on mutational load. The primary cell-type-specific mutational increases in AlzD are observed in excitatory neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and a “senescent” cell population, with microglia largely maintaining a homeostatic profile across disease and control groups.

This study integrates full-length single-nucleus RNA-seq (SMART-Seq2) with matched whole-genome sequencing (WGS) from post-mortem prefrontal cortex samples of 36 individuals (19 AlzD, 17 controls). Cell types were annotated using canonical marker genes, and somatic mutations were inferred by comparing single-cell transcriptomes to germline WGS, focusing on exonic variants with high allelic fraction.

**Cell Type Proportions and Identity**  
Microglia were identified using canonical markers (C3, CD74, CSF1R) and formed a distinct cluster in the t-SNE embedding (see Figure 2, panel with labeled clusters).

However, within glia, the most pronounced disease-associated increases in mutational burden were observed in astrocytes (24% increase in AlzD, p=0.038) and oligodendrocytes (17.5% increase, p=0.02), with microglia not highlighted as showing significant disease-specific enrichment (<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>). The main text and figures do not indicate a statistically significant difference in microglial mutational burden between AlzD and controls.

**Microglial Subtypes and States**  
No distinct microglial subtypes or disease-associated states were reported in this study. Microglia were treated as a single, homeostatic population for the purposes of mutational burden analysis. There is no evidence from the clustering or gene expression analyses that microglia in this dataset segregate into homeostatic versus disease-associated (e.g., DAM, PAM) states, nor is there mention of microglial activation markers or trajectory analyses specific to microglia.

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**  
The study does not report microglia-specific differential gene expression or pathway enrichment analyses related to somatic mutational burden. Most pathway and gene-level findings pertain to neurons, oligodendrocytes, and astrocytes, with microglia not featuring among the cell types with significant mutational enrichment in Alzheimer’s-related genes or pathways.

**Host/Genetic Modulators**  
No significant modulation of microglial mutational burden by age, sex, or genetic risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype) is reported. The study notes that overall glial burden correlates with age (r=0.26), but this is not broken down for microglia specifically.

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**  
There is no spatial transcriptomic or morphological validation of microglial findings in this study. The focus is on transcriptomic clustering and mutational analysis.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**  
The study does not present pseudotime or trajectory analyses for microglia, nor does it discuss microglial state transitions in relation to disease progression or aging.

**Gene Regulatory Networks and Cell-Cell Communication**  
No microglia-specific gene regulatory network or ligand-receptor analyses are reported.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
Microglia in this study do not emerge as a major driver of somatic mutational burden in Alzheimer’s dementia. Unlike astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, microglia do not show significant disease-associated increases in mutational load or evidence of disease-specific subtypes. The findings suggest that, at least in the prefrontal cortex and with the methods used, microglial somatic mosaicism is not a prominent feature of Alzheimer’s pathology. This contrasts with GWAS findings that implicate microglial enhancers in inherited risk, highlighting a potential divergence between inherited and somatic genetic contributions to microglial involvement in AlzD (<keyFinding priority='2'>, <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>).
</clinical>

---

3) **Research Implications**

This study provides a foundational resource for cell-type-specific somatic mosaicism in the aging and Alzheimer’s brain, but microglia do not display the disease-associated mutational enrichment or subtype heterogeneity seen in other glial or neuronal populations. The lack of microglial substructure or activation states (e.g., DAM) may reflect technical limitations (e.g., SMART-Seq2 sensitivity, sample size) or true biological differences in somatic mutation accumulation. The findings raise questions about the relative contribution of somatic versus inherited genetic variation to microglial function in neurodegeneration, especially given the strong GWAS enrichment for microglial enhancers in Alzheimer’s risk. Future studies with larger microglial sample sizes, spatial transcriptomics, or multi-omic integration may be needed to resolve whether rare microglial subpopulations or regional heterogeneity contribute to disease. The absence of microglial mutational enrichment in this dataset does not contradict prior models but highlights the need for further investigation into the somatic genomic landscape of microglia in neurodegeneration.

Disease focus: Drug-refractory epilepsy (DRE)
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-cell CITE-seq (simultaneous transcriptome and surface protein profiling) was performed on immune cells isolated from 11 brain tissue samples (6 pediatric DRE patients) from various cortical regions. Clustering and cell type identification were based on both gene expression and surface protein markers. Validation included multispectral immunohistochemistry (IHC) and comparison to published snRNA-seq/scRNA-seq datasets from non-neurological controls and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) brains.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Heterogeneity**  
Microglia (CD45^lo^CD11b^lo^) were robustly identified as the dominant resident immune population in all DRE samples, forming 13 transcriptionally distinct clusters (clusters 0–7, 9–12, 14). These clusters were present across all patients and sampled brain regions, indicating a conserved microglial response in DRE. <keyFinding priority='2'>No major loss or gain in overall microglial abundance was reported, but a marked shift in microglial state composition was observed.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Microglial Subtype Characterization**  
The microglial compartment in DRE was highly heterogeneous, with subtypes distinguished by inflammatory activation and loss of homeostatic markers:

- **Pro-inflammatory Microglia (DRE-M):**  
  Several clusters (notably clusters 7, 5, 9, 11) were characterized by high expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines (IL1B, IL18, CXCL8/IL8, CCL4, TNF), MHC class II genes (HLA-DRA, HLA-DPB1), and complement pathway genes (C3, C1QA/B/C). These clusters showed low expression of canonical homeostatic microglial markers (CX3CR1, P2RY12).  
  <keyFinding priority='1'>Pro-inflammatory microglial subtypes with high IL1B, TNF, HLA-DRA/DPB1 and low CX3CR1/P2RY12 dominate DRE lesions, representing a disease-associated state distinct from controls.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

- **Homeostatic-like Microglia:**  
  Clusters expressing higher levels of P2RY12 and CX3CR1, with lower inflammatory gene expression, were present but less abundant in DRE compared to controls.  
  <keyFinding priority='2'>Homeostatic microglia (P2RY12^high^, CX3CR1^high^) are relatively depleted in DRE tissue compared to controls.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

- **MS-like Microglia:**  
  Clusters 9–12 in DRE showed a phenotype similar to microglia enriched in multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions (high HLA-DRA/DPB1, low CX3CR1/P2RY12), suggesting convergence of inflammatory microglial states across CNS autoimmune diseases.  
  <keyFinding priority='2'>A subset of DRE microglia transcriptionally resembles MS lesion-associated microglia.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**  
- DRE microglia upregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL1B, IL1A, TNF), chemokines (CCL2, CCL4), complement genes, and MHC class II genes.
- Downregulation of purinergic receptor P2RY12 and CX3CR1 in pro-inflammatory clusters, indicating loss of homeostatic signaling.
- Gene ontology analysis of IL1B^high^ clusters revealed enrichment for apoptosis, cell migration, cytokine production, and negative regulation of cell death.
<keyFinding priority='1'>Pro-inflammatory and motility/apoptosis pathways are strongly upregulated in DRE microglia.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**  
- Multispectral IHC confirmed IL-1β production by AIF1^+^ microglia in DRE lesions, but not in controls.
- Astrocytes (GFAP^+^) also produced IL-1β, but microglia were the predominant source.
<keyFinding priority='2'>In situ validation supports microglial IL-1β production as a hallmark of DRE lesions.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Comparative Analysis with Controls and ASD**  
- Microglia from non-neurological controls and ASD brains (snRNA-seq/scRNA-seq) expressed homeostatic markers (P2RY12, CX3CR1, AIF1, CSF1R, IL18) but lacked pro-inflammatory cytokine/chemokine expression.
- Only 6.9% of microglia in pathologically normal tissue expressed high IL1B, compared to 33.5% in DRE.
<keyFinding priority='1'>Pro-inflammatory microglial activation is specific to DRE and not observed in ASD or non-neurological controls.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell-Cell Communication and Disease Modulators**  
- Ligand-receptor (LR) interactome analysis revealed that DRE microglia express adhesion molecules (integrins, ICAM1), chemokines, and cytokines that may facilitate infiltration and interaction with peripheral immune cells.
- Direct physical interactions between microglia and T cells were identified, with mutual upregulation of pro-inflammatory genes (e.g., CCL4, IL1B in microglia; IFNG, GZMA/B in T cells).
<keyFinding priority='1'>Microglia in DRE directly interact with infiltrating T cells, mutually enhancing inflammatory gene expression.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**  
- No explicit pseudotime or trajectory analysis was performed, but the data suggest a shift from homeostatic to pro-inflammatory microglial states in DRE.
</findings>

<clinical>
Microglia in DRE brain tissue adopt a highly pro-inflammatory, antigen-presenting phenotype, producing IL-1β, TNF, and chemokines, and losing homeostatic markers (P2RY12, CX3CR1). These states are strongly associated with the presence of drug-refractory epilepsy and are not seen in controls or ASD. The microglial activation profile in DRE resembles that seen in MS, suggesting shared immune mechanisms. Microglia may contribute to disease by creating a chemotactic environment that recruits peripheral immune cells and by directly interacting with T cells to amplify inflammation. These findings support the hypothesis that microglial-driven neuroinflammation is central to DRE pathogenesis and may represent a therapeutic target or biomarker for disease activity. <keyFinding priority='1'>Microglial pro-inflammatory activation may drive or sustain epileptogenic pathology in DRE.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</clinical>

---

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**  
In pediatric drug-refractory epilepsy (DRE), microglia form multiple pro-inflammatory subtypes characterized by high IL1B, TNF, HLA-DRA/DPB1, and low P2RY12/CX3CR1 expression, dominating lesional tissue. These states are validated by in situ IL-1β production and are absent in non-neurological controls or ASD. Microglia directly interact with infiltrating T cells, mutually amplifying inflammatory gene expression. The pro-inflammatory microglial phenotype is conserved across patients and brain regions, and closely resembles microglial states seen in multiple sclerosis, suggesting shared immune mechanisms in CNS autoimmunity.

---

**Research Implications (≈150 words):**  
This study establishes that microglia in DRE are not a uniform population but comprise distinct subtypes, with a predominance of pro-inflammatory, antigen-presenting states. The loss of homeostatic markers (P2RY12, CX3CR1) and upregulation of cytokines/chemokines (IL1B, TNF, CCL4) suggest a shift toward a disease-associated microglial phenotype, paralleling findings in MS. The direct interaction between microglia and T cells, with reciprocal inflammatory activation, highlights a potential feedback loop sustaining neuroinflammation in epilepsy. Open questions include the temporal dynamics of microglial state transitions, the reversibility of pro-inflammatory activation, and the precise triggers (e.g., neuronal activity, peripheral immune infiltration) driving these changes. The study’s findings align with emerging models of microglial heterogeneity in CNS disease but extend them to epilepsy, a disorder not classically considered immune-mediated. No explicit contradictions with prior microglial classification schemes are discussed, but the convergence with MS-associated microglial states is emphasized. Future work should address whether targeting microglial activation can ameliorate DRE and whether similar mechanisms operate in other forms of epilepsy.

# summary for Lau 2020 (microglia)

**Quick Reference**

This study (Lau et al., 2020, PNAS) used single-nucleus RNA-seq of human prefrontal cortex to profile cell-type-specific changes in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). For microglia, the authors identified 13 subpopulations, with only three (notably m6) showing significant AD-associated changes. The m6 microglial subtype, marked by complement genes (C1QA, C1QB, C1QC) and cytokine receptors (IL4R, IL1RAP), was reduced in AD, suggesting impaired synaptic pruning. No strong genetic or demographic driver was highlighted for microglial subtypes.

- Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
</metadata>

<methods>
- Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on 169,496 nuclei from prefrontal cortex (BA6, BA8, BA9) of 12 AD patients and 9 controls.
- Cell type identification used canonical and novel marker genes; subclustering and differential expression analyses were performed for each major cell type.
- Validation included comparison with bulk microarray and previous snRNA-seq datasets.
</methods>

<findings>
The study identified six major cell types, including microglia (C3+, 4.7% of nuclei). Microglia were further subdivided into 13 transcriptomic subpopulations. However, only three subpopulations (m1, m6, m7) contributed to AD-associated transcriptomic changes, with the most notable being m6.

The m6 microglial subpopulation was characterized by high expression of complement genes (C1QA, C1QB, C1QC) and cytokine receptors (IL4R, IL1RAP). This subtype is implicated in synaptic pruning and cytokine response. In AD samples, the proportion of m6 microglia was reduced compared to controls. The authors interpret this as a loss of a microglial population important for normal synaptic pruning, potentially leading to imbalanced complement signaling and aberrant synaptic elimination in AD. <keyFinding priority='1'>The reduction of m6 microglia (C1QA/B/C+, IL4R+, IL1RAP+) is a key AD-associated change, suggesting impaired complement-mediated synaptic pruning.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Other microglial subpopulations (m1, m7) also contributed to transcriptomic changes, but the paper does not provide detailed marker gene lists or functional annotations for these subtypes. The overall number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in microglia was moderate (340 DEGs: 111 up, 229 down in AD vs. control). Pathway analysis linked microglial DEGs to immune system processes, cytokine response, and membrane organization, but did not highlight strong disease-associated activation or DAM-like states as seen in some other studies.

No significant changes in total microglial proportion were observed between AD and control samples. The study did not report strong associations between microglial subtypes and genetic (e.g., APOE) or demographic factors, nor did it identify a clear trajectory of microglial activation or a disease-stage progression for these subtypes.

Validation with previous snRNA-seq data (Mathys et al., 2019) found only 13 overlapping microglial DEGs, with most showing concordant directionality, supporting the robustness of the observed changes but also highlighting limited overlap with prior datasets. <keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial transcriptomic changes in AD are modest and partially overlap with previous studies, but do not reveal a dominant disease-associated microglial (DAM) signature.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

No spatial or morphological validation of microglial subtypes was performed. The study did not report on microglial morphology, activation scores, or direct links to AD pathology (e.g., amyloid or tau load).

<clinical>
The reduction of the m6 microglial subpopulation in AD suggests a loss of cells involved in complement-mediated synaptic pruning and cytokine signaling. This may contribute to synaptic dysfunction, a hallmark of AD, by disrupting the balance of synaptic elimination and maintenance. However, the findings are associative and do not establish causality. The absence of a strong DAM-like signature or clear disease-stage trajectory for microglia in this dataset suggests that microglial responses in AD may be more heterogeneous or context-dependent than previously thought. Therapeutic implications are limited, but restoring or modulating complement-related microglial functions could be explored as a potential strategy.
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications**

This study refines our understanding of microglial heterogeneity in the human AD brain. The identification of a reduced C1QA/B/C+, IL4R+, IL1RAP+ (m6) microglial subpopulation highlights the importance of complement-mediated synaptic pruning in AD pathogenesis. However, the lack of a robust DAM-like signature and the modest overlap with prior snRNA-seq studies (e.g., Mathys et al., 2019) suggest that microglial responses may vary by brain region, disease stage, or technical approach. Open questions include whether the loss of m6 microglia is a cause or consequence of synaptic dysfunction, how these subtypes relate to known microglial activation states (e.g., DAM, PAM), and whether similar changes occur in other brain regions or in response to genetic risk factors. Future studies should integrate spatial, morphological, and longitudinal data to clarify the functional roles of microglial subtypes in AD and their potential as therapeutic targets. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Disease focus: Parkinson’s disease (PD)
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and single-nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) were performed on postmortem human substantia nigra (SN) tissue from late-stage PD patients and controls. Bulk H3K27ac ChIP-seq and in situ Hi-C were integrated for cis-regulatory element (cRE) mapping and 3D chromatin contact analysis. Cell type annotation was based on canonical markers, and multiomic integration enabled cell type–resolved analysis of transcriptomic and epigenomic changes.
</methods>

---

**Quick Reference**

This study reveals that microglia in the Parkinson’s disease substantia nigra exhibit distinct transcriptional and epigenomic dysregulation, including upregulation of immune response and autophagy pathways, and are enriched for PD risk gene expression (notably SNCA, LRRK2, VPS13C, and GAK). Microglial cis-regulatory elements (cREs) are significantly associated with PD GWAS variants, and microglia-specific regulatory disruption is a key feature of the PD genetic landscape, particularly in individuals with risk alleles.

---

**Detailed Summary**

<findings>
The authors performed single-nucleus transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling of the human substantia nigra, focusing on cell type–specific changes in PD. Microglia were identified using canonical markers (CD74, RUNX1) and analyzed for both transcriptional and regulatory alterations.

**Cell Type Proportions and Disease Association**  
Microglia were robustly detected in both PD and control SN, with no explicit report of major proportional shifts between groups. However, microglia were highlighted as one of the key glial cell types with significant disease-associated molecular changes, alongside oligodendrocytes.

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**  
Microglia in PD showed upregulation of genes involved in immune response and autophagy, as well as downregulation of genes related to protein lipidation. Notably, several established PD risk genes (SNCA, LRRK2, VPS13C, GAK) were differentially expressed in microglia, indicating a strong disease association.

**Microglial Subtypes and Functional States**  
While the study does not provide a fine-grained subclustering of microglia into discrete subtypes (e.g., homeostatic vs. disease-associated microglia), it does identify microglia as a functionally distinct population with upregulated immune and autophagy signatures in PD. The modular gene expression analysis (Fig. 6) shows that microglia-specific modules (C1) are enriched for response to unfolded proteins and reactive oxygen species, processes relevant to neuroinflammation and PD pathology.  
<keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial gene modules in PD are enriched for stress response and protein homeostasis pathways, suggesting a shift toward a reactive, potentially neuroinflammatory state.</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Regulatory Landscape and GWAS Integration**  
Microglia-specific cREs were found to be significantly enriched for PD GWAS variants in two major studies (Chang et al., Nalls et al.), indicating that genetic risk for PD is at least partly mediated through microglial regulatory elements. The study’s LDSC regression analysis (Fig. 4A) shows that microglial cREs are among the most strongly enriched for PD heritability, second only to oligodendrocytes.  
<keyFinding priority='1'>Microglial cREs are significantly enriched for PD GWAS variants, supporting a genetic contribution to microglial dysregulation in PD.</keyFinding>

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Dysregulated cREs and Target Genes**  
The integration of Hi-C and ABC modeling identified 223 microglia-specific target genes of dysregulated cREs and PD GWAS-SNPs. These genes are highly cell type–specific, with many being unique to microglia. Down-regulated cREs in microglia were particularly associated with genes involved in protein lipidation (e.g., MPPE1, ATG10, ZDHHC20), while up-regulated cREs were linked to autophagy and stress response genes (e.g., PTGES3, RUVBL2).  
<keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial cREs dysregulated in PD preferentially target genes involved in protein lipidation and autophagy, implicating these pathways in microglial contribution to PD.</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Transcription Factor Motif Disruption**  
Motif analysis revealed that microglia-enriched TFs (e.g., ZNF148) are frequently disrupted by PD GWAS-SNPs, with a bias toward loss of TF binding at risk alleles. This suggests that genetic risk variants may impair microglial gene regulation by altering TF binding at key regulatory elements.  
<keyFinding priority='2'>PD GWAS-SNPs frequently disrupt microglia-enriched TF motifs, especially ZNF148, leading to reduced expression of target genes in PD donors.</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell-Cell Communication and Spatial Validation**  
The study does not report direct ligand-receptor analysis or spatial transcriptomics for microglia, but the integration of multiomic data and validation of regulatory effects (e.g., CRISPR editing in SH-SY5Y cells) supports the functional relevance of the identified microglial regulatory changes.

**Host/Genetic Modulators**  
Microglial cREs are enriched for PD GWAS variants, and the allelic bias analysis shows that risk alleles are associated with reduced regulatory activity in microglia, further supporting a genetic contribution to microglial dysfunction in PD.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**  
While the study is cross-sectional, the modular gene expression analysis suggests that microglial activation and stress response pathways are prominent in late-stage PD SN, consistent with a role for microglia in disease progression.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
Microglia emerge as a central glial cell type in PD pathogenesis, with both transcriptional and regulatory dysregulation linked to genetic risk. The upregulation of immune and autophagy pathways, along with the enrichment of PD risk gene expression and GWAS variant effects in microglia, suggests that microglial dysfunction may contribute to neuroinflammation and neuronal vulnerability in PD. These findings highlight microglial regulatory elements and their target genes as potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers for PD, though causal relationships remain to be established.
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications**

This study positions microglia as a key mediator of genetic and epigenetic risk in Parkinson’s disease, with strong evidence that microglial regulatory elements are hotspots for PD GWAS variants and that microglial gene expression shifts toward immune activation and stress response in disease. Open questions include the precise functional consequences of microglial regulatory disruption, the existence of finer-grained microglial subtypes (e.g., homeostatic vs. disease-associated microglia) in PD, and the temporal dynamics of microglial activation during disease progression. The findings align with, but also extend, prior models that emphasized microglia in Alzheimer’s disease, showing that in PD, both microglia and oligodendrocytes are prominent in the genetic architecture. Future work should address the causal role of microglial subpopulations in PD, their interaction with neuronal degeneration, and the potential for targeting microglial regulatory networks in therapy.

## 1) Quick Reference

The PsychAD atlas reveals that microglia in the human DLPFC display disease- and stage-specific transcriptomic changes across neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. In Alzheimer’s disease, microglial abundance increases with amyloid plaque burden and tau pathology, and microglial gene programs shift from homeostatic to lipid-droplet-accumulating, inflammatory, and phagocytic states, with key upregulated markers including DPYD, IL15, and PTPRG. These microglial responses are strongly modulated by AD polygenic risk and are implicated as aggravating factors in dementia progression.

---

## 2) Detailed Summary

<findings>
The PsychAD study provides a comprehensive single-nucleus transcriptomic atlas of the human DLPFC, enabling systematic analysis of microglial heterogeneity and disease associations across a large, diverse cohort. Microglia are annotated as a distinct immune cell subclass within the unified taxonomy, validated by canonical marker expression and spatial transcriptomics (<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>).

**Cell Type Proportions and Disease Associations:**  
Across neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), including AD, DLBD, Vas, Tau, FTD, and PD, microglia show a significant increase in relative abundance compared to neurotypical controls (<keyFinding priority='1'>). This increase is most pronounced in AD and correlates with higher CERAD plaque scores and Braak tau stages (<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>). In contrast, neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs) do not show a similar microglial expansion, highlighting disease specificity (<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Microglial Subtypes and States:**  
While the primary taxonomy designates a single “Micro” subclass, the study’s trajectory and gene expression analyses reveal dynamic microglial state transitions along the AD pathological continuum. In early AD stages, microglia upregulate genes involved in innate immune activation, phagocytosis, and negative regulation of cell migration. As pathology advances, microglia increasingly express genes associated with lipid metabolism, lipid-droplet accumulation, and inflammatory responses (<keyFinding priority='1'>). Notably, late-stage microglial gene modules are highly enriched for AD GWAS risk loci, and also overlap with genetic risk for MS and PD (<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>).

**Defining Marker Genes and Functional Programs:**  
Key upregulated microglial genes in AD include DPYD, IL15, and PTPRG, all previously implicated in neuroinflammation and microglial activation (<keyFinding priority='2'>). Early-stage upregulation is seen for ACSL1, DPYD, and CD163, which are linked to a lipid-droplet-accumulating phenotype, especially in APOE4/4 carriers. Homeostatic microglial markers (CX3CR1, NAV2, P2RY12) are among the most strongly downregulated genes as tau pathology increases, indicating a loss of homeostatic identity and transition to disease-associated states (<keyFinding priority='1'>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>). These transitions are non-linear, with the greatest transcriptomic shifts occurring at intermediate Braak stages.

**Pathway Enrichment:**  
Microglial DEGs in AD are enriched for pathways related to negative regulation of cell motility, migration, response to lipoprotein particles, phagocytosis, and adaptive immune activation (e.g., antigen presentation, T cell response). Early upregulation of innate immune and phagocytic pathways is followed by late upregulation of lipid metabolism and adaptive immune response genes (<keyFinding priority='2'>). These findings are supported by both pseudotime trajectory analysis and functional enrichment (GO BP, MF, CC) (<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>).

**Disease Modulators and Mediation Analysis:**  
Mediation analysis demonstrates that microglial expansion and activation are downstream of AD polygenic risk and amyloid plaque accumulation, and in turn, microglial changes mediate increases in vascular leptomeningeal cells (VLMCs) and reductions in specific interneuron subtypes (IN_LAMP5_LHX6, IN_SST), both of which are associated with aggravated dementia (<keyFinding priority='1'>). Thus, microglia are positioned as key aggravating factors in the AD pathological cascade (<confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> due to cross-sectional design).

**Gene Regulatory Networks and Cell-Cell Communication:**  
While the study does not provide an explicit microglial regulon analysis, the enrichment of AD GWAS loci in late-stage microglial gene modules suggests that genetic risk converges on microglial regulatory programs. The study also implicates microglia in cross-talk with vascular and neuronal compartments, particularly through lipid metabolism and immune signaling pathways (<keyFinding priority='2'>, <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>).

**Spatial and Morphological Validation:**  
Spatial transcriptomics confirm the presence and distribution of microglia in the DLPFC, and the upregulation of disease-associated markers is validated at the transcript level. However, detailed morphological validation (e.g., immunostaining for lipid droplets) is not presented in this study (<keyFinding priority='3'>, <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>).

**Aging and Disease Trajectories:**  
Trajectory modeling reveals that microglial gene expression changes are highly non-linear across the AD continuum, with early innate immune activation and late lipid-droplet/inflammatory programs. These transitions are distinct from normal aging, supporting an AD-specific microglial response (<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Genetic and Multi-omic Integration:**  
Late-stage microglial gene modules are significantly enriched for AD GWAS risk loci, and the overall microglial response is modulated by polygenic risk scores. The study does not report eQTLs specific to microglial subtypes but demonstrates strong genetic-transcriptomic concordance at the cell-class level (<keyFinding priority='1'>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>).

Microglia emerge as central aggravating players in AD pathogenesis, with their expansion and activation tightly linked to amyloid and tau pathology and to genetic risk. The transition from homeostatic to lipid-droplet-accumulating, inflammatory states may exacerbate neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. These findings suggest that targeting microglial lipid metabolism or inflammatory signaling could represent therapeutic strategies, and that microglial gene signatures may serve as biomarkers for disease progression or treatment response. However, causal inferences are limited by the cross-sectional nature of the data, and further experimental validation is needed.

## 3) Research Implications

The PsychAD atlas establishes a robust framework for dissecting microglial heterogeneity and disease associations at population scale. The identification of non-linear, stage-specific microglial gene programs—particularly the late-stage lipid-droplet-accumulating and inflammatory states—aligns with recent models of microglial dysfunction in AD and supports the relevance of microglial-targeted interventions. The enrichment of AD GWAS risk loci in these microglial modules reinforces the genetic contribution to microglial pathogenicity.

Open questions include the precise molecular drivers of the microglial state transitions, the reversibility of the lipid-droplet phenotype, and the functional consequences for neuronal and vascular integrity. The study’s taxonomy is broadly concordant with prior single-cell atlases, but the explicit identification of microglial subtypes is limited to state transitions rather than discrete clusters, which may reflect the DLPFC region or technical resolution. No explicit contradictions with prior microglial classification schemes are discussed (<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

Future work should focus on integrating spatial, morphological, and functional validation of microglial states, as well as longitudinal and experimental studies to clarify causality and therapeutic potential. The PsychAD resource will facilitate such investigations and cross-disease comparisons.

# summary for Leng 2021 (microglia)

1) **Quick Reference**

This study (Leng et al., 2021, *Nature Neuroscience*) used single-nucleus RNA-seq to profile the caudal entorhinal cortex (EC) and superior frontal gyrus (SFG) across Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression. For microglia, the authors found only a trend toward increased abundance in the EC with advancing Braak stage, but did **not** identify distinct disease-associated microglial (DAM) subtypes or robust transcriptional changes, likely due to technical limitations of snRNA-seq. No strong genetic or demographic modulators were reported for microglial states in this dataset.

- Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
</metadata>

<methods>
- Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on postmortem human brain tissue from the caudal entorhinal cortex (EC) and superior frontal gyrus (SFG).
- Samples spanned Braak stages 0, 2, and 6 (early to late AD), all from male APOE ε3/ε3 individuals.
- Major cell types were identified and subclustered after cross-sample alignment; microglia were specifically analyzed for abundance and transcriptional states.
</methods>

<findings>
The authors systematically examined microglia in both the EC and SFG across AD progression. After quality control, they recovered thousands of nuclei per region and performed clustering to identify major cell types, including microglia.

**Cell Type Proportions:**  
In the EC, there was a **trend** toward increased relative abundance of microglia with advancing Braak stage, consistent with the concept of microgliosis in AD. However, this trend did not reach statistical significance after correction for multiple comparisons (<confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>). In the SFG, no significant changes in microglial abundance were observed across Braak stages.

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
The authors performed subclustering of microglia in both regions, identifying four subpopulations in the EC and five in the SFG. However, these subpopulations did **not** correspond to clear homeostatic or disease-associated (DAM) states as described in mouse models or some human studies. Specifically, the majority of canonical DAM marker genes (e.g., APOE, TREM2, CST7, LPL, SPP1) and homeostatic markers (e.g., P2RY12, TMEM119, CX3CR1) were **not robustly detected** in the snRNA-seq data, either in this study or in reanalysis of the Mathys et al. dataset. This was attributed to the relatively low number of genes captured per microglial nucleus and the depletion of many DAM markers in nuclei compared to whole cells (<keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial subclustering did not resolve DAM-like states; canonical DAM markers were not reliably detected in human snRNA-seq data.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>).

**Differential Gene Expression & Pathway Enrichment:**  
No significant or consistent disease-associated transcriptional signatures were identified in microglia. The authors did not report any pathways or gene modules specifically up- or downregulated in microglial subpopulations with disease progression.

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
No significant effects of host factors (age, sex, APOE genotype) or genetic risk variants on microglial states were reported, as the cohort was restricted to male APOE ε3/ε3 individuals.

**Spatial Analysis & Validation:**  
No spatial or morphological validation of microglial states was performed in this study.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
While microglial abundance trended upward in the EC with disease progression, no evidence for stage-specific transitions or activation trajectories was found at the transcriptomic level.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
No eQTL or multi-omic integration for microglia was performed.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

</findings>

<clinical>
The study provides limited evidence for microglial involvement in AD at the transcriptomic level using snRNA-seq. While microgliosis (increased microglial numbers) is a well-established feature of AD, this dataset did not reveal distinct disease-associated microglial states or robust gene expression changes. The authors caution that technical limitations of snRNA-seq (low gene detection in microglia, nuclear depletion of DAM markers) may obscure detection of such states. Thus, the findings do not support a major disease-driving or mitigating role for specific microglial subtypes in this dataset, nor do they suggest immediate biomarker or therapeutic implications for microglial states as defined here.
</clinical>

---

3) **Research Implications**

This study highlights the technical challenges of profiling microglial heterogeneity and activation states using single-nucleus RNA-seq in human postmortem brain. The inability to robustly detect DAM or other disease-associated microglial signatures—despite trends in cell abundance—suggests that nuclear RNA may not adequately capture the full spectrum of microglial activation, especially for genes enriched in the cytoplasm or induced in disease. The authors’ findings are consistent with recent reports (e.g., Thrupp et al., 2020) that snRNA-seq underrepresents DAM markers in human tissue. Future studies may require single-cell (whole-cell) RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, or proteomic approaches to resolve microglial states in AD. The lack of strong microglial subtype findings in this study does not contradict the established role of microglia in AD, but underscores the need for improved methodologies. No explicit conflicts with prior models are discussed by the authors.

Disease focus: Multiple sclerosis (MS), subcortical white matter lesions
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) were performed on postmortem subcortical white matter from 12 MS lesions (8 chronic active [MS-CA], 4 chronic inactive [MS-CI]) and 7 controls. Lesion types were defined by histology (LFB, CD68/CD163 IHC, iron stains). Cell type annotation and subclustering were performed using established marker genes, with spatial deconvolution and niche identification via computational factor analysis. Validation included immunohistochemistry and single-molecule FISH.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and General Microglial Changes**
Microglia (MC, myeloid cells) were robustly captured and subclustered into multiple subtypes. In MS-CA lesions, microglia were particularly enriched at the lesion rim (LR), while in MS-CI lesions, microglia were less abundant and more evenly distributed. Quantitative analysis showed increased MC abundance in the LR of MS-CA compared to MS-CI and controls, supporting a spatially restricted, chronic inflammatory microglial response at the lesion edge. <keyFinding priority='1'>The rim of chronic active lesions is a microglia-enriched niche, with increased MC abundance and activation signatures compared to inactive lesions and controls.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Microglial Subtype Identification and Characterization**
The study identified several microglial subtypes, including:
- **Homeostatic microglia (Homeo1, Homeo2):** Defined by P2RY12, CX3CR1, FRMD4A, and ARHGAP12. These subtypes were predominant in control tissue and periplaque white matter (PPWM), associated with synaptic maintenance and immune surveillance. Their abundance was reduced in MS lesions, especially at the rim.
- **Chronic active (CA) microglia:** Characterized by upregulation of activation and phagocytosis genes (TRAF3, PARP9, SPP1, CD163, FTL, APOE, APP, C1QB, C1QC, GPNMB, PARVG, IQGAP1), and iron/lipoprotein metabolism. These were highly enriched at the LR of MS-CA lesions. <keyFinding priority='1'>CA microglia at the MS-CA rim show a distinct activation profile, including iron handling (CD163, FTL), complement activation (C1QB/C), and phagocytosis markers (SPP1, GPNMB).</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **Disease-associated (Dis) microglia:** Overlapping with CA but also present in lesion core (LC) and VI (vascular infiltrating) niches, expressing regulatory and tissue remodeling genes (ANXA2, LRRK2, TGFB1, AGPS, CLEC7A, CLEC12A, ITGB1, PI3CG).
- **Phagocytic microglia (Phago):** Expressing genes linked to debris clearance and lipid metabolism, present in both lesion rim and core.
- **Transitioning and Rim microglia:** Intermediate states with partial activation, spatially mapping to border zones (PPWM, LR).

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**
- In MS-CA, microglial subtypes upregulated genes involved in inflammation (TRAF3, PARP9, SPP1), iron/lipid metabolism (CD163, FTL, APOE, APP), complement activation (C1QB/C), and cytoskeletal remodeling (PARVG, IQGAP1).
- In MS-CI, microglial subtypes upregulated tissue remodeling and regulatory genes (ANXA2, LRRK2, TGFB1, AGPS), as well as pattern recognition and cell motility genes (CLEC7A, CLEC12A, ITGB1, PI3CG).
- Pathway analysis revealed enrichment for phagocytosis, complement activation, lipid metabolism, and interferon/TNF signaling in MS-CA microglia, while MS-CI microglia showed more tissue repair and regulatory pathway signatures.

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**
- Spatial transcriptomics and immunostaining confirmed that activated microglia (CD68+, CD163+) are concentrated at the rim of chronic active lesions, with iron accumulation (Turnbull blue) supporting a role in iron handling.
- Single-molecule FISH validated the proximity of microglia expressing activation markers to astrocytes and endothelial cells at the lesion rim.

**Cell-Cell Communication and Niche Interactions**
- Microglia at the MS-CA rim engage in specific ligand-receptor interactions, notably:
  - **HMGB1 (astrocyte ligand) – CD163/TLR2 (microglial receptors):** Implicates microglia in sensing astrocyte-derived danger signals at the rim.
  - **CD14 (microglial ligand) – ITGB1 (astrocyte/endothelial receptor):** Suggests microglia may modulate glial and vascular remodeling at the rim.
- These interactions were spatially mapped to the inflamed rim and validated by smFISH. <keyFinding priority='2'>Microglia at the MS-CA rim participate in spatially restricted cell-cell communication with astrocytes and endothelial cells, potentially mediating inflammation and tissue remodeling.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Host/Genetic Modulators and Metrics**
- The study did not directly analyze genetic risk variants, but iron-handling microglia (CD163+, FTL+) at the rim are consistent with prior reports linking iron metabolism to MS progression.
- Quantitative metrics: MC abundance and activation scores were highest at the MS-CA rim, correlating with lesion activity.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**
- Microglial activation and subtype transitions were most pronounced in chronic active lesions, with a shift from homeostatic to activated and phagocytic states at the rim, and more regulatory/remodeling states in chronic inactive lesions.

**Contradictions/Departures**
- The authors note that their microglial subtype definitions and spatial mapping are consistent with prior snRNA-seq studies of MS lesions, but provide higher spatial resolution and niche-specific insights. No explicit contradictions with previous models are discussed. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
Microglia are central to the compartmentalized inflammation at the rim of chronic active MS lesions. The CA microglial subtype, enriched at the rim, is strongly associated with ongoing tissue damage, iron accumulation, and complement activation, potentially driving lesion expansion and chronicity. Microglial-astrocyte and microglial-endothelial interactions at the rim may mediate both inflammatory and tissue remodeling processes. These findings suggest that rim microglia are key effectors of chronic lesion activity and may serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets for progressive MS. <keyFinding priority='1'>Targeting microglial activation and cell-cell communication at the lesion rim may offer new avenues for intervention in progressive MS.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>
</clinical>

---

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**
This study reveals that microglia in subcortical MS lesions are highly heterogeneous and spatially organized, with a distinct chronic active (CA) microglial subtype enriched at the rim of chronic active lesions. These rim microglia upregulate genes for iron metabolism (CD163, FTL), complement activation (C1QB/C), and phagocytosis (SPP1, GPNMB), and engage in spatially restricted interactions with astrocytes and endothelial cells. The abundance and activation of these microglia are tightly linked to lesion activity and chronic inflammation, highlighting the rim as a key microglial niche in progressive MS.

---

**Research Implications (≈150 words):**
This work provides a high-resolution atlas of microglial heterogeneity and spatial organization in subcortical MS lesions, emphasizing the importance of the rim as a chronic inflammatory niche. The identification of CA microglia with iron-handling and complement activation signatures aligns with, but extends, previous models of disease-associated microglia (DAM) and rim-associated microglia (RAM) in MS and other neurodegenerative diseases. The spatially resolved cell-cell communication networks involving microglia, astrocytes, and endothelial cells suggest new mechanisms for lesion expansion and chronicity. Open questions include the precise functional roles of these microglial subtypes in lesion progression, their relationship to genetic risk factors, and whether targeting microglial-astrocyte or microglial-endothelial interactions can halt or reverse chronic lesion activity. The study’s findings are largely consistent with prior snRNA-seq data but provide novel spatial and niche-level insights, with no explicit contradictions reported. Future work should address the functional validation of these microglial states and their therapeutic potential.

</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) and single-nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) were performed on postmortem human motor cortex (BA4) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA9) from C9-ALS (n=6), C9-FTD (n=5), and control (n=6) donors. Additional validation included FANS-sorted bulk RNA-seq, H3K27ac ChIP-seq, and Western blotting. Cell type annotation was based on iterative clustering and marker gene expression.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and General Patterns**
Microglia were robustly identified as a major non-neuronal cell type in both motor and frontal cortices. The study found that, compared to astrocytes, microglia exhibited relatively fewer differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in C9-ALS and C9-FTD, suggesting a more modest transcriptional response in microglia at end-stage disease. <keyFinding priority='2'>Microglia in both C9-ALS and C9-FTD showed significant but less extensive transcriptional changes compared to astrocytes.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Microglial Subtypes and Marker Genes**
The paper did not report the identification of multiple distinct microglial subtypes or states within the microglial population by clustering, nor did it describe disease-specific microglial subpopulations (e.g., DAM, ARM) as seen in some neurodegenerative models. Instead, microglia were treated as a single major cell type for differential expression and epigenomic analyses. <keyFinding priority='3'>No distinct microglial subtypes or disease-associated microglial states were reported in this dataset.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathways**
In C9-ALS, microglia showed a small but significant set of DEGs compared to controls. Among the upregulated genes, MYO1E (encoding myosin 1E) was highlighted as a robustly increased transcript in microglia, with corresponding enrichment of active chromatin at its promoter (H3K27ac ChIP-seq). <keyFinding priority='2'>MYO1E was transcriptionally upregulated in C9-ALS microglia, with concordant epigenetic activation at its promoter.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Other upregulated microglial genes included AEBP1 and ITGB4, though the paper did not elaborate on their functional implications in microglia. Downregulated genes in microglia were not specifically detailed.

Pathway enrichment for microglial DEGs was not emphasized, likely due to the limited number of DEGs. There was no evidence for strong enrichment of canonical inflammatory, phagocytic, or interferon response pathways in microglia, in contrast to findings in astrocytes.

**Epigenomic and Multi-omic Integration**
The study performed snATAC-seq and H3K27ac ChIP-seq on FANS-sorted microglia. There was a strong positive correlation between differential gene expression and promoter H3K27ac signal in microglia (Spearman r=0.51, p<0.001), indicating that transcriptional changes were accompanied by epigenetic activation at relevant loci. <keyFinding priority='1'>Microglial transcriptional changes in C9-ALS are strongly concordant with promoter H3K27ac acetylation, supporting a robust epigenetic basis for observed gene expression changes.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

However, snATAC-seq did not reveal significant differential chromatin accessibility peaks between C9-ALS and controls in microglia, likely due to technical limitations (lower signal/noise and statistical power).

**Disease and Region Specificity**
Microglial transcriptional changes were present in both motor and frontal cortices, but the number of DEGs was lower than in astrocytes or oligodendrocytes. In C9-FTD, microglia also showed a significant but modest number of DEGs, with some overlap but also divergence from C9-ALS. The most strongly affected microglial DEGs in one disease did not show consistent changes in the other, indicating disease-specific microglial responses. <keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial gene expression changes in C9-ALS and C9-FTD are largely non-overlapping, suggesting disease-specific microglial activation profiles.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators & Metrics**
No strong associations were reported between microglial changes and host factors (age, sex, genotype), nor were quantitative activation or morphology scores applied to microglia in this study.

**Cell-Cell Communication and Spatial Analysis**
The paper did not report ligand-receptor analyses or spatial validation (e.g., immunostaining) specifically for microglial subpopulations.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**
No pseudotime or trajectory analyses were performed for microglia, and the study did not address microglial state transitions over disease progression.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**
No direct links were made between microglial DEGs and ALS/FTD GWAS risk variants.

</findings>

<clinical>
Microglia in C9-ALS and C9-FTD exhibit modest but significant transcriptional and epigenetic alterations, with MYO1E upregulation and strong concordance between gene expression and promoter H3K27ac acetylation. These changes suggest that microglia are engaged in disease-specific responses, but the lack of strong inflammatory or phagocytic signatures and the absence of distinct disease-associated microglial subtypes indicate a more limited or late-stage activation profile in end-stage disease. The findings imply that microglial activation in C9-ALS and C9-FTD is context-dependent and may not recapitulate the robust DAM/ARM phenotypes seen in other neurodegenerative models. There are currently no direct therapeutic or biomarker implications for microglial subtypes from this study, but the robust epigenetic-transcriptional coupling in microglia may inform future studies of microglial modulation in ALS/FTD.

**Detailed Summary**

This study provides a comprehensive single-nucleus transcriptomic and epigenomic analysis of postmortem motor and frontal cortices from C9orf72 mutation carriers with ALS or FTD, as well as controls.

The study performed snATAC-seq and H3K27ac ChIP-seq on FANS-sorted microglia. While H3K27ac ChIP-seq revealed strong concordance with gene expression changes, snATAC-seq did not identify significant differential chromatin accessibility peaks between C9-ALS and controls in microglia, likely due to technical limitations such as lower signal/noise and statistical power. <keyFinding priority='2'>snATAC-seq did not reveal significant differential chromatin accessibility in microglia, likely due to technical limitations.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Research Implications**

This study demonstrates that microglia in C9-ALS and C9-FTD undergo modest but significant transcriptional and epigenetic changes, with MYO1E upregulation and strong concordance between gene expression and promoter H3K27ac acetylation. However, the absence of distinct microglial subtypes or robust inflammatory signatures suggests that microglial activation in these diseases may be more limited or occur at earlier disease stages not captured in end-stage tissue. The findings raise important questions about the temporal dynamics of microglial activation in ALS/FTD and whether more pronounced or disease-specific microglial states might be detectable at earlier stages or with higher-resolution approaches. Future studies should aim to resolve microglial heterogeneity in ALS/FTD, integrate spatial transcriptomics, and link microglial states to genetic risk and clinical progression. The robust epigenetic-transcriptional coupling observed in microglia may inform future therapeutic strategies targeting microglial activation or chromatin remodeling in ALS/FTD. No explicit conflicts with prior models were discussed by the authors. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Quick Reference**

This study identifies a robust, disease-associated microglial state in ALS motor cortex, marked by upregulation of endolysosomal and proinflammatory genes (e.g., CTSD, SPP1, TREM2, SQSTM1/p62, GRN, LRRK2), and downregulation of homeostatic markers. The ALS microglial signature is distinct from AD and MS, and is partially recapitulated by microglia exposed to apoptotic neurons in vitro. No major microglial subtype expansion was observed, but a DAM-like (disease-associated microglia) state predominates in ALS, modulated by neuronal stress and possibly genetic risk factors.

---

**Detailed Summary**

<findings>
The authors profiled 79,169 nuclei from ALS and control cortices, identifying all major CNS cell types, including microglia. Microglia accounted for ~3% of nuclei, with no significant change in overall proportion between ALS and controls.

**Cell Type Proportions:**  
There was no significant expansion or depletion of microglia in ALS cortex compared to controls (<keyFinding priority='3'>No major change in microglial abundance</keyFinding>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Microglial Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
Unbiased clustering of 1,452 microglial nuclei revealed three subclusters:
- **Micro0:** Homeostatic microglia, expressing P2RY12, CX3CR1, IRF8.
- **Micro1:** DAM-like (disease-associated microglia), upregulated in ALS, expressing CTSD, SPP1, TREM2, SQSTM1/p62, GRN, LRRK2, APOE, CPM, GPNMB, ASAH1, ITGAX, LGALS3, and downregulating homeostatic markers.
- **Micro2:** Cycling microglia, minor population.

The DAM-like Micro1 state was significantly enriched in ALS samples, while homeostatic Micro0 was relatively depleted (<keyFinding priority='1'>ALS cortex is dominated by a DAM-like microglial state with upregulation of endolysosomal and inflammatory genes</keyFinding>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Differential Gene Expression:**  
ALS microglia showed upregulation of genes involved in:
- Endolysosomal/vesicle trafficking: CTSD, SQSTM1/p62, GRN, LRRK2, ASAH1, LGALS3, SPP1, GPNMB, TREM2, OPTN.
- Lipid metabolism: APOE, APOC1.
- Inflammatory response: ITGAX, CPM, CD68.
- Downregulation of homeostatic genes: P2RY12, CX3CR1, IRF8.

These changes were robust to individual outlier exclusion and consistent across patients (<keyFinding priority='1'>ALS microglia upregulate endolysosomal, lipid metabolism, and inflammatory genes while downregulating homeostatic markers</keyFinding>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Pathway Enrichment:**  
GO analysis confirmed enrichment for endocytosis, exocytosis, lysosomal function, vesicle trafficking, myeloid activation, and degranulation pathways in ALS microglia. These pathways are linked to neurodegeneration and are distinct from those upregulated in AD or MS microglia (<keyFinding priority='2'>ALS microglial activation is characterized by endolysosomal and vesicle trafficking pathways, not classical immune activation</keyFinding>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Cell-Cell Communication & Modulators:**  
The DAM-like state was partially recapitulated in vitro by exposing iPSC-derived microglia to apoptotic neurons, which induced upregulation of lysosomal and DAM genes (CTSD, ITGAX, LGALS3, SQSTM1/p62) and downregulation of homeostatic genes, suggesting that neuronal stress/apoptosis is a key driver (<keyFinding priority='2'>Neuronal apoptosis induces DAM-like gene expression in microglia</keyFinding>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

Connectivity Map analysis suggested that the ALS microglial signature is positively correlated with cell cycle/senescence regulators and negatively with type I interferon responses, indicating possible exhaustion of proliferative capacity and a distinct inflammatory profile.

**Comparisons to Other Diseases:**  
The ALS DAM-like signature overlaps partially with DAM states in AD and MS (e.g., TREM2, APOE, GPNMB, SPP1), but ALS-specific upregulation of vesicle trafficking and lysosomal genes (SQSTM1/p62, GRN, LRRK2, ASAH1) distinguishes it from other neurodegenerative conditions (<keyFinding priority='2'>ALS microglial activation shares features with but is molecularly distinct from AD/MS DAM states</keyFinding>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).

**Spatial/Morphological Validation:**  
No direct spatial or morphological validation of microglial subtypes was reported in this study.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
No explicit pseudotime or trajectory analysis for microglia was performed, but the DAM-like state is interpreted as a disease-associated activation rather than an aging phenomenon.

**Genetic/Multi-omic Integration:**  
Several upregulated microglial genes (TREM2, GRN, SQSTM1, OPTN) are known ALS–FTD risk genes, suggesting genetic convergence on this reactive state.
</findings>

<clinical>
The study implicates microglia as key mediators of ALS cortical pathology, with a shift from homeostatic to DAM-like, endolysosomal/inflammatory states. This microglial activation is likely driven by neuronal stress and apoptosis, and may contribute to neurodegeneration via impaired clearance, altered lipid metabolism, and chronic inflammation. The distinct molecular profile of ALS microglia (relative to AD/MS) suggests that targeting endolysosomal and vesicle trafficking pathways, or modulating DAM-like activation, could represent novel therapeutic strategies. The overlap with genetic risk factors further supports microglia as a potential biomarker and intervention point in ALS.
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications**

This study provides strong evidence that ALS microglia adopt a DAM-like, endolysosomal/inflammatory state, distinct from homeostatic microglia and from DAMs in AD/MS. The upregulation of genes such as CTSD, SPP1, TREM2, SQSTM1/p62, and GRN aligns with known ALS–FTD risk loci, suggesting genetic convergence on this reactive phenotype. The partial recapitulation of this state by neuronal apoptosis in vitro supports a model where microglial activation is secondary to neuronal injury, but may also exacerbate disease progression.

Open questions include whether this DAM-like state is neuroprotective or deleterious in ALS, how it evolves over disease course, and whether it can be modulated therapeutically. The lack of major microglial subtype expansion (as seen in some AD studies) suggests that functional reprogramming, rather than proliferation, is the dominant response in ALS cortex. Future studies should address spatial localization, longitudinal dynamics, and the impact of genetic modifiers (e.g., C9orf72, TREM2 variants) on microglial states. The findings are consistent with, but extend beyond, prior DAM frameworks by highlighting endolysosomal and vesicle trafficking as central to ALS microglial pathology.

# summary for Ling 2024 (microglia)

1) **Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This large-scale snRNA-seq study of human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC) (n=191 donors, 22–97 years, including schizophrenia cases and controls) found that microglia show minimal transcriptional or proportional changes associated with either aging or schizophrenia. The major multicellular gene-expression program identified (SNAP), which coordinates synaptic and cholesterol biosynthesis genes in neurons and astrocytes, does **not** significantly involve microglial subtypes. Microglial gene expression and proportions remain stable across disease and age, with no evidence for disease-associated microglial activation or subtype expansion. Thus, microglia are not implicated as primary drivers or responders in the SNAP program or in schizophrenia-related cortical pathology in this dataset. <keyFinding priority='3'>Microglia show no significant disease- or age-associated changes in this study.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>

- **Disease focus:** Schizophrenia and aging
</metadata>

<methods>
This study used single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on frozen post-mortem human dlPFC (Brodmann area 46) from 191 donors (97 controls, 94 schizophrenia cases, ages 22–97). Nuclei were assigned to major cell types (glutamatergic neurons, GABAergic neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, polydendrocytes, microglia, endothelial cells) and subtypes using established marker genes and computational clustering. Latent factor analysis (PEER) and consensus non-negative matrix factorization (cNMF) were used to identify multicellular gene-expression programs. Cell-type proportions and gene expression were compared across age, disease status, and other covariates.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Microglia comprised approximately 3.6% of all nuclei (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 1). The study explicitly states that each donor contributed nuclei of all major cell types, including microglia, and that subsequent analyses excluded samples with atypical cell-type proportions. However, neither schizophrenia nor age was associated with significant variation in the relative abundance of microglia (see Extended Data Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 1c,d). <keyFinding priority='3'>No significant changes in microglial proportions with disease or age.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression & Pathway Enrichment:**  
The central finding of the paper is the identification of a multicellular gene-expression program (SNAP: Synaptic Neuron and Astrocyte Program) that is co-regulated in neurons and astrocytes, and declines in both aging and schizophrenia. This program is defined by synaptic and cholesterol biosynthesis genes in neurons and astrocytes, respectively.  
Microglia do **not** contribute to the SNAP program: among the 1,000 gene/cell-type expression traits with the strongest SNAP (LF4) loadings, 99% involved neurons or astrocytes, with only a negligible microglial component (Fig. 1g). Gene set enrichment and latent factor analyses did not identify any microglial-specific gene-expression programs associated with schizophrenia or aging. <keyFinding priority='3'>Microglial gene expression is not significantly altered in schizophrenia or aging, nor is it involved in the SNAP program.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
The study does not report the identification of distinct microglial subtypes or states associated with disease, age, or SNAP expression. Microglia are treated as a single, relatively homogeneous population in this dataset. No disease-associated microglial (DAM) or other activation states are described. Extended Data Fig. 7a shows that microglial expression of cholesterol biosynthesis genes is minimal and unchanged in schizophrenia. <keyFinding priority='3'>No evidence for disease- or age-associated microglial subtypes or activation states.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
No significant modulation of microglial gene expression or proportion by age, sex, schizophrenia status, or other covariates is reported. The study specifically notes that the SNAP program is not present in microglia, and that microglial gene expression does not correlate with SNAP expression in neurons or astrocytes.

**Gene Regulatory Networks, Cell-Cell Communication, Spatial Analysis:**  
No microglia-specific regulatory networks, ligand-receptor interactions, or spatial/morphological findings are reported. The focus of cell-cell communication and regulatory analysis is on neuron–astrocyte interactions.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
Temporal modeling and pseudotime analyses are not applied to microglia, as no dynamic or disease-associated microglial states are detected.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
No integration of microglial gene expression with schizophrenia GWAS or other genetic risk factors is reported. The genetic enrichment analyses focus on neuron- and astrocyte-expressed genes.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>  
The authors do not discuss any contradictions between their microglial findings and prior literature. They do not report any evidence for microglial activation or disease association, in contrast to some previous studies in other brain regions or disorders, but this is not explicitly discussed as a contradiction.

</findings>

<clinical>
**Disease-specific roles:**  
The study concludes that microglia are not primary participants in the multicellular gene-expression program (SNAP) that declines in schizophrenia and aging. There is no evidence from this dataset that microglia contribute to, or respond to, the synaptic or metabolic changes observed in neurons and astrocytes in the dlPFC in these conditions.

**Mechanistic insights:**  
No mechanistic role for microglia in schizophrenia or age-related cortical pathology is suggested by these data. The absence of microglial activation or subtype expansion implies that microglia are not major drivers or responders in the molecular pathology captured by this study.

**Therapeutic or biomarker implications:**  
Microglial markers or states are not proposed as therapeutic targets or biomarkers for schizophrenia or age-related cognitive decline in this context.

</clinical>

---

3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

The absence of significant microglial transcriptional or proportional changes in this large, well-powered human snRNA-seq study of dlPFC suggests that, at least in this cortical region and in the context of schizophrenia and normal aging, microglia do not undergo major disease- or age-associated state transitions. This finding contrasts with reports of disease-associated microglial (DAM) states in neurodegenerative disorders or in other brain regions, but the authors do not explicitly discuss such discrepancies. The results imply that microglial activation is not a universal feature of cortical pathology in schizophrenia or aging, and that neuron–astrocyte interactions are more central to the molecular changes observed here. Open questions remain regarding whether microglial responses might be more prominent in other brain regions, at earlier disease stages, or in response to different pathologies. Future studies could apply more sensitive or spatially resolved approaches to detect subtle microglial heterogeneity or rare states. The lack of microglial involvement in the SNAP program also suggests that therapeutic strategies targeting microglia may not be effective for the synaptic and metabolic deficits described in schizophrenia and aging in the dlPFC. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

# summary for Macnair 2024 (microglia)

Quick Reference

This large-scale snRNA-seq study of multiple sclerosis (MS) brain tissue identifies seven microglial subtypes, including homeostatic (P2RY12+, CX3CR1+) and reactive states (TREM2+, APOE+, GPNMB+, IL1B+), with disease-associated microglia (DAM/MIMS-like) enriched in MS white matter lesions. Microglial state transitions are more strongly determined by patient-specific factors than by lesion type, with reactive subtypes (Micro_C–E) increased in active and chronic lesions, and homeostatic microglia (Micro_A/B) reduced. No single microglial signature defines lesion subtypes; instead, coordinated multicellular stress and immune programs stratify patients, with microglial activation correlating with oligodendrocyte and astrocyte responses. Age, sex, and MS subtype do not explain microglial heterogeneity, but patient identity is a major driver.

Detailed Summary

<metadata>
Macnair et al., 2025, Neuron. "snRNA-seq stratifies multiple sclerosis patients into distinct white matter glial responses."
Disease focus: Multiple sclerosis (MS), with emphasis on white matter (WM) and gray matter (GM) pathology.
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on 632,000 nuclei from 156 post-mortem brain samples (WM and GM) from 54 MS patients and 28 controls. Samples included various lesion types (active, chronic active, chronic inactive, remyelinated, normal-appearing WM/GM) and were processed with rigorous QC, batch correction, and clustering. Subtype identification was validated by marker gene expression and spatial analysis; findings were replicated in an independent cohort and by RNAscope in situ hybridization.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Disease Association**
Microglia were divided into seven subclusters, with Micro_A and Micro_B representing homeostatic microglia (P2RY12+, CX3CR1+), and Micro_C–E representing reactive/disease-associated states (TREM2+, APOE+, GPNMB+, IL1B+). Perivascular macrophages (PVMs, MARCO+, LYVE1+) and a proliferative microglia cluster were also identified.

In MS white matter, there is a shift from homeostatic microglia (Micro_A/B) toward reactive subtypes (Micro_C–E), particularly in active (AL) and chronic active (CAL) lesions. Homeostatic microglia are reduced, while Micro_C (stress/chaperone markers: HSPA6, HIF1A), Micro_D (GPNMB, MITF), and Micro_E (IL1B, CCL3) are increased. These reactive subtypes resemble previously described DAM/MIMS states in neurodegeneration and MS. <keyFinding priority='1'>The increase in reactive microglia is a hallmark of MS lesions, but the magnitude and specific subtype composition vary between patients more than between lesion types.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathways**
Microglial subtypes are defined by distinct marker genes:
- Micro_A/B: P2RY12, CX3CR1 (homeostatic, downregulated in lesions)
- Micro_C: HSPA6, HIF1A (stress/chaperone response)
- Micro_D: GPNMB, MITF (DAM/MIMS-like, upregulated in lesions)
- Micro_E: IL1B, CCL3 (pro-inflammatory, upregulated in lesions)

Pathway analysis shows upregulation of stress response, chaperone, and inflammatory genes in reactive microglia, with downregulation of homeostatic markers. <keyFinding priority='2'>These changes are consistent across lesion types, suggesting a global microglial response to MS pathology rather than lesion-specific programs.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Subtype Characterization and Disease Progression**
- Micro_A/B (homeostatic): Predominant in control and normal-appearing WM, reduced in AL/CAL.
- Micro_C (stress): Increased in AL/CAL, expresses chaperone and hypoxia markers.
- Micro_D (DAM/MIMS-like): Increased in lesions, expresses GPNMB, MITF; similar to microglial states in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.
- Micro_E (pro-inflammatory): Increased in lesions, expresses IL1B, CCL3.
- PVMs: Present but not expanded in MS lesions.

No evidence for a single "MS-specific" microglial state; instead, a spectrum of activation states is observed, with patient identity explaining most variance. <keyFinding priority='1'>Patient-specific factors, rather than lesion type, are the dominant determinant of microglial gene expression and subtype composition.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators and Metrics**
Age, sex, MS subtype, and post-mortem interval do not explain microglial heterogeneity. Instead, patient identity is the strongest modulator, as shown by hierarchical clustering and MOFA factor analysis. <keyFinding priority='1'>Microglial activation states are coordinated with oligodendrocyte and astrocyte responses, forming multicellular programs that stratify patients into distinct pathological subgroups.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**
RNAscope in situ hybridization confirmed upregulation of key microglial markers (e.g., HSP90AA1, NAMPT) in MS lesions, correlating with MOFA factor scores. <keyFinding priority='2'>Spatial validation supports the existence of distinct microglial activation states in MS white matter.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**
No evidence for a simple trajectory from homeostatic to reactive microglia based on lesion stage; instead, microglial states are distributed according to patient-specific factors, suggesting stable, individual-specific activation profiles.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**
No direct link to genetic risk variants or eQTLs for microglial subtypes is reported in this study.

</findings>

<clinical>
Microglia in MS white matter undergo a shift from homeostatic to reactive states, but the pattern and extent of activation are determined more by patient-specific factors than by lesion type or clinical variables. This suggests that microglial responses are part of coordinated multicellular programs that define pathological subgroups of MS patients. While reactive microglia may contribute to demyelination and neurodegeneration, their precise mechanistic role remains associative. The identification of patient-specific microglial activation profiles has potential implications for precision medicine, as therapies targeting microglial activation may need to be tailored to individual pathological patterns rather than lesion categories. Microglial markers validated by RNAscope may serve as candidate biomarkers for patient stratification.
</clinical>

Research Implications

This study challenges the traditional view that microglial activation in MS is primarily determined by lesion type or stage. Instead, it demonstrates that microglial heterogeneity is dominated by patient-specific factors, with reactive subtypes (DAM/MIMS-like, stress, pro-inflammatory) variably expanded across individuals. The microglial subtypes identified here align with previously described DAM/MIMS states in MS and other neurodegenerative diseases, supporting the generalizability of these activation programs. However, the lack of a single "MS-specific" microglial state and the absence of clear lesion-stage trajectories suggest that microglial responses are embedded within broader, multicellular pathological programs.

Open questions include the molecular drivers of patient-specific microglial activation, the functional consequences of different microglial states for demyelination and repair, and the potential for peripheral biomarkers to capture CNS microglial pathology. The study's findings support a move toward precision medicine in MS, where microglial (and glial) activation profiles could inform patient stratification and therapeutic targeting. Future work should integrate genetic, proteomic, and longitudinal data to clarify the stability and clinical relevance of microglial subtypes, and to resolve whether similar patient-specific patterns exist in other neurodegenerative diseases. No explicit contradictions with prior models are discussed; rather, the study extends and refines current understanding of microglial heterogeneity in MS.

# summary for Marinaro 2020 (microglia)

**Quick Reference (≈100 words)**  
This study used single-nucleus RNA-seq of frontal cortex from monogenic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) patients and matched controls to reveal that microglia in monogenic AD exhibit a distinct, disease-specific activation state. Monogenic AD microglia upregulate APOE, SPP1, complement C1Q, and genes involved in antigen presentation and lysosomal function, differing from both homeostatic and acutely activated (hemorrhage-associated) microglia. The AD microglial phenotype closely resembles the human Alzheimer’s microglia (HAM) signature, rather than the murine damage-associated microglia (DAM) state. This disease-specific activation is not driven by acute injury but is associated with chronic neurodegeneration and genetic background.

<methods>
The authors performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on post-mortem frontal cortex (Brodmann area 9) from 8 individuals with monogenic AD (4 PSEN1, 4 APP mutations) and 8 age- and sex-matched controls. Neuronal and glial nuclei were separated by FACS (NeuN+ and NeuN-), and droplet-based snRNA-seq was performed. Cell types were annotated using the Allen Institute’s human brain cell atlas as a reference. The final dataset comprised 89,325 high-confidence nuclei.  
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Microglia proportions were not significantly altered in monogenic AD compared to controls, as shown in Figure 1E.

**Differential Gene Expression & Pathway Enrichment:**  
Microglia in monogenic AD display a robust activation signature. Key upregulated genes include APOE, SPP1 (osteopontin), complement component C1QA, and genes involved in antigen presentation (e.g., HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB1), lysosomal function (e.g., LAMP1, CTSD), and leukocyte-mediated immunity (GO:0002443). These changes are summarized in Figure 3A and 3C. <keyFinding priority='1'>Monogenic AD microglia upregulate APOE, SPP1, C1QA, and antigen presentation/lysosomal genes, indicating a disease-specific activation state.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
The study does not report multiple discrete microglial subtypes within the AD or control groups but rather characterizes a shift from a homeostatic to an AD-specific activation state. This state is distinct from both homeostatic microglia and microglia acutely activated by intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). Figure 3D shows that microglia from AD, ICH, and controls form separate clusters in t-SNE space. <keyFinding priority='2'>AD microglia form a transcriptionally distinct cluster, separate from both homeostatic and acutely activated (ICH) microglia.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Functional Signature:**  
The AD microglial phenotype is characterized by increased expression of genes involved in:
- Antigen presentation (HLA-DRA, HLA-DRB1, CD74)
- Complement activation (C1QA, C1QB, C1QC)
- Lysosomal function (LAMP1, CTSD)
- Immune cell migration and phagocytosis (P2RY12, TREM2, TYROBP)
- Stress response (HSPB1)
- Lipid metabolism (APOE)

This activation signature is more similar to the recently described human Alzheimer’s microglia (HAM) than to the murine damage-associated microglia (DAM) state (Figure 3F). <keyFinding priority='1'>Monogenic AD microglia most closely resemble the HAM (human Alzheimer’s microglia) signature, not murine DAM.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Disease Association and Modulators:**  
The microglial activation state is specific to chronic neurodegeneration in AD and is not recapitulated by acute injury (ICH). The authors note that ICH microglia upregulate SPP1, FTH1, and S100A11, but the overall transcriptional profile is distinct from AD microglia. <keyFinding priority='2'>AD microglial activation is disease-specific and not a general response to brain injury.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell-Cell Communication:**  
Analysis of ligand-receptor co-expression revealed increased potential signaling between microglia and neurons in AD (Figure 4A). For example, microglial GRN (granulin) and neuronal SORT1 are both upregulated, potentially enhancing neuronal lysosomal function (Figure 4B). Conversely, neuron-microglia signaling via CX3CL1/CX3CR1 is reduced due to downregulation of both ligand and receptor (Figure 4C). <keyFinding priority='2'>Neuron-microglia signaling is altered in AD, with both adaptive (GRN/SORT1 upregulation) and deleterious (CX3CL1/CX3CR1 downregulation) changes.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Spatial/Morphological Validation:**  
No specific spatial or morphological validation of microglial subpopulations is reported, but the transcriptional activation state is robustly defined by snRNA-seq clustering and marker gene expression.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
The study is cross-sectional and does not model temporal trajectories, but the authors suggest that the observed microglial activation is a chronic, disease-associated state rather than an acute or early-stage response.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
The study does not directly link microglial subtypes to specific genetic risk variants, but notes upregulation of APOE and other AD GWAS genes in microglia.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> for all major findings, as the authors do not report explicit conflicts with prior microglial models, but rather extend and refine the human-specific AD microglial signature.

</findings>

<clinical>
Microglia in monogenic AD adopt a disease-specific activation state characterized by upregulation of genes involved in immune response, antigen presentation, and lysosomal function. This state is distinct from both homeostatic and acutely activated microglia, suggesting that chronic neurodegeneration induces a unique microglial response. The upregulation of APOE and complement genes may contribute to both protective and pathogenic processes, potentially influencing amyloid clearance, synaptic pruning, and neuroinflammation. The resemblance to the HAM signature highlights the importance of studying human microglia in AD, as murine models may not fully recapitulate the disease-relevant activation states. These findings suggest that targeting microglial activation or specific pathways (e.g., complement, lysosomal function) could have therapeutic potential, but the dual adaptive and deleterious roles of microglia warrant cautious interpretation.
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**  
This study demonstrates that microglia in monogenic AD exhibit a distinct, disease-specific activation state (HAM-like) that is not observed in acute injury or in murine models (DAM). The upregulation of APOE, SPP1, complement, and antigen presentation genes suggests a complex role for microglia in chronic neurodegeneration, potentially balancing protective and pathogenic functions. Open questions include whether this activation state is neuroprotective, deleterious, or context-dependent, and how it evolves over disease progression. The lack of discrete microglial subtypes in this dataset may reflect limitations of snRNA-seq or true biological homogeneity in the disease context. Future studies should integrate spatial transcriptomics, longitudinal sampling, and functional assays to dissect the causal roles of microglial activation in AD. The findings align with emerging human-specific microglial classification schemes (HAM) and underscore the need for human-based models in AD research. No explicit contradictions with prior data are discussed, but the divergence from murine DAM highlights species differences in microglial responses to neurodegeneration.

# summary for Martirosyan 2024 (microglia)

Quick Reference

Martirosyan et al. (2024) performed snRNA-seq on human substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) from 15 Parkinson’s disease (PD) and 14 control brains, identifying six microglial subpopulations. Notably, a TH-enriched microglia subtype (Microglia1), marked by TH, HSP90AA1, and HSPA8, is significantly depleted in PD, while other subtypes (e.g., Microglia2, Microglia4) show pro-inflammatory or reactive signatures. Microglia1 depletion is associated with upregulation of unfolded protein response (UPR) and oxidative stress genes, and Microglia4 is enriched for APOE and complement genes. These findings suggest microglial heterogeneity and selective vulnerability in PD, with genetic risk loci (e.g., LRRK2, P2RY12) showing cell-type specificity.

<findings>
Martirosyan et al. systematically dissected microglial heterogeneity in the human SNpc using snRNA-seq, identifying six distinct microglial subpopulations (Microglia0–Microglia5), each with unique marker gene signatures and functional associations.

**Cell Type Proportions and Disease Association**
A key finding is the significant depletion of the Microglia1 subpopulation in PD samples compared to controls (<keyFinding priority='1'>Microglia1, a TH-enriched microglial state, is selectively lost in PD</keyFinding>). This depletion is statistically robust and validated across donors (<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>).

  - **Functional signature:** Complement cascade, immune response, UPR, oxidative stress, iron storage (FTL, FTH1)
  - **Disease association:** Not significantly depleted in PD; represents a reactive, possibly late-stage, microglial state
  - **Genetic link:** APOE is a major AD/PD risk gene, highly expressed in Microglia4

  - <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

- **Other subtypes (Microglia0, Microglia3, Microglia5)**
  - **Microglia3:** ABCA1, MITF, STARD13, SRGAP1, SH3PXD2A, RGL1; downregulation of GTPase activity and ubiquitin-related genes in PD
  - **Microglia0, Microglia5:** Less disease-specific, involved in cell adhesion, myelination, GTPase activity

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathways**
- Microglia1 in PD shows upregulation of UPR and oxidative stress genes, and acetyltransferase activity, consistent with stress and apoptotic vulnerability.
- Microglia2 and Microglia4 are enriched for immune and inflammatory pathways, with Microglia4 showing strong complement and HLA gene expression.
- Microglia3 shows downregulation of GTPase and ubiquitin activity in PD.

**Genetic Modulators**
- LRRK2 and P2RY12, both PD GWAS risk genes, are enriched in microglia (LRRK2 in Microglia and OPC; P2RY12 in Microglia2).
- No significant enrichment of GWAS genes in microglia as a whole, but subpopulation-specific associations are observed (<keyFinding priority='2'>Subpopulation-specific expression of PD risk genes (e.g., P2RY12 in Microglia2)</keyFinding>).

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**
- Spatial transcriptomics confirms microglial marker expression and TH+ microglia in situ, though at lower levels than neurons.
- Meta-analysis with an independent dataset (Kamath et al.) supports the depletion of TH+ microglia in PD (<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>).

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**
- Microglia1, Astrocytes2, and Oligos2 (all TH-enriched) are depleted in PD, suggesting a shared vulnerability of dopamine-metabolizing glia.
- Microglia2 and Microglia4 may represent sequential or alternative activation states in PD progression.

Microglial heterogeneity in the SNpc is pronounced, with a TH-enriched microglial subpopulation (Microglia1) showing selective vulnerability and depletion in PD. This depletion is associated with upregulation of UPR and oxidative stress pathways, suggesting that microglial stress responses may contribute to neurodegeneration. Other microglial subtypes (Microglia2, Microglia4) display pro-inflammatory or reactive signatures, with genetic risk loci (P2RY12, LRRK2, APOE) showing subpopulation-specific expression. These findings imply that microglial subtypes may differentially drive or mitigate PD pathology, and that TH+ microglia could serve as a biomarker or therapeutic target for early microglial dysfunction in PD. However, causal roles remain to be established, and most associations are cross-sectional.

Research Implications

This study highlights the existence of multiple, functionally distinct microglial subpopulations in the human SNpc, with a TH-enriched subtype (Microglia1) being selectively vulnerable in PD. The depletion of Microglia1, alongside similar losses in TH+ astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, suggests a broader vulnerability of dopamine-metabolizing glia in PD. The identification of subpopulation-specific expression of PD risk genes (e.g., P2RY12 in Microglia2, APOE in Microglia4) provides a framework for linking genetic risk to cell-type-specific pathology. These microglial states partially align with previously described homeostatic, reactive, and disease-associated microglia, but the TH-enriched microglial state is novel in the context of PD (<keyFinding priority='1'>Novel identification of a TH-enriched, PD-vulnerable microglial subtype</keyFinding>). Open questions include the functional role of TH in microglia, the temporal sequence of microglial state transitions, and whether targeting UPR/oxidative stress pathways in microglia can modify disease progression. The study’s findings are consistent with, and extend, prior models of microglial activation in neurodegeneration, with no explicit contradictions reported (<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>). Future work should address causality, longitudinal dynamics, and therapeutic targeting of microglial subtypes in PD.

# summary for Mathys 2019 (microglia)

**Quick Reference**

This study (Mathys et al., 2019, *Nature*) used single-nucleus RNA-seq of human prefrontal cortex to reveal a distinct microglial subpopulation (Mic1) strongly associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. Mic1 is marked by upregulation of MHC class II genes (CD74, HLA-DRB1), APOE, and complement genes, and is overrepresented in females with AD. The Mic1 state overlaps with, but is distinct from, mouse disease-associated microglia (DAM), and is linked to genetic AD risk factors.

**Research Implications**

This study establishes Mic1 as a robust, disease-associated microglial state in human AD, marked by MHC-II, APOE, and complement gene upregulation. The overlap with mouse DAM is partial, with several Mic1 markers (e.g., APOE, C1QB, CD14) unique to human AD, as explicitly discussed by the authors. This highlights the need for human-specific models in microglial research. The strong female enrichment of Mic1 suggests that sex should be considered in future studies and therapeutic strategies. Open questions include the causal role of Mic1 in neurodegeneration, its temporal dynamics, and whether targeting Mic1 can modify disease progression. The findings align with, but also extend, existing microglial classification schemes by defining a human-specific AD-associated state.

# summary for Mathys 2023 (microglia)

1) **Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This large-scale single-nucleus RNA-seq study of the aged human prefrontal cortex (Mathys et al., 2023, Cell) identifies significant microglial expansion in late-stage Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with microglia showing upregulation of genes involved in cell activation, defense response, and the TYROBP causal network. These changes are most pronounced in individuals with high AD pathology and are accompanied by increased microglial abundance. The study also notes sex-specific responses and validates findings across multiple cohorts, highlighting microglial activation as a robust correlate of AD progression and a potential modulator of cognitive decline.

<metadata>
- Mathys et al., 2023, Cell 186:4365–4385

<methods>
- Single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) of prefrontal cortex tissue from 427 ROSMAP participants (2.3 million nuclei)

</methods>

<findings>
The study provides a comprehensive atlas of cell-type-specific transcriptomic changes in the aged human prefrontal cortex, with a particular focus on how microglia respond to AD pathology and cognitive decline.

**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Microglia constitute a minority of total cells (~3.6%) but show a significant increase in relative abundance in individuals with the highest levels of global AD pathology, neuritic plaque burden, and amyloid load. This expansion is robust across multiple measures and is confirmed by quasi-binomial regression and validation in an independent dataset. <keyFinding priority='1'>Microglial expansion is a hallmark of late-stage AD pathology in the prefrontal cortex.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression:**  
Microglia display a strong AD-pathology-associated transcriptional signature. Genes upregulated in microglia with increasing AD pathology are enriched for pathways related to cell activation, regulation of defense response, and the TYROBP causal network. These include canonical microglial activation markers and immune response genes. <keyFinding priority='1'>Upregulation of TYROBP network and defense response genes in microglia is strongly associated with AD pathology.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Pathway Enrichment:**  
Pathways most significantly altered in microglia include:
- Cell activation and immune response (e.g., complement, phagocytosis)
- TYROBP (DAP12) signaling, a central regulator of microglial activation in neurodegeneration
- Regulation of defense response, including genes involved in inflammation and antigen presentation

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
While the main text does not provide a detailed breakdown of microglial subtypes, it references a companion paper (Sun et al., 2023, Cell) for in-depth microglial state analysis. In this study, microglia are treated as a unified population for most analyses, but the authors note that microglial activation states are likely heterogeneous and that their expansion is a consistent feature of AD progression. <keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial activation is likely to involve multiple sub-states, but this paper focuses on overall abundance and activation signatures.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
- Sex-specific responses to AD pathology are observed in microglia, consistent with prior reports, but detailed sex-stratified findings are not elaborated in the main text.
- No significant associations are found between microglial gene expression and non-AD variables (e.g., diabetes, vascular pathology) after correcting for AD pathology.
- The study does not report direct associations between microglial states and specific genetic risk alleles (e.g., APOE), but notes that host factors may modulate microglial activation.

**Gene Regulatory Networks:**  
The TYROBP (DAP12) network is highlighted as a key regulatory axis in microglial activation in AD. This network integrates signals from multiple immune receptors and is implicated in the transition to disease-associated microglial states.

**Cell-Cell Communication:**  
While not the main focus, the upregulation of immune signaling pathways in microglia suggests increased cross-talk with other glial and neuronal populations in AD.

**Spatial Analysis:**  
No direct spatial or morphological validation of microglial subtypes is presented in this paper, but increased microglial abundance is inferred from snRNA-seq proportions and supported by prior histological studies.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
Microglial expansion and activation are most pronounced at late stages of AD pathology, suggesting a temporal progression from homeostatic to activated states as disease advances. <keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial activation and expansion are late-stage events in AD progression.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
No direct eQTL or GWAS integration for microglial states is reported in this paper, but the authors reference the broader literature and companion studies for such analyses.

</findings>

<clinical>
Microglial activation and expansion are robust correlates of AD pathology and cognitive decline in the aged human cortex. The upregulation of immune and TYROBP signaling pathways in microglia may contribute to neuroinflammation and neuronal dysfunction in AD, although causality cannot be established from cross-sectional data. The findings reinforce microglia as potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers for AD progression, particularly in late-stage disease. <keyFinding priority='1'>Microglial activation is a promising biomarker and potential therapeutic target in AD, especially in advanced stages.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study confirms and extends the central role of microglial activation in Alzheimer’s disease, demonstrating that microglial expansion and upregulation of immune response pathways are consistent features of late-stage AD pathology in the human prefrontal cortex. The robust association with the TYROBP network and defense response genes aligns with prior models of disease-associated microglia (DAM), although this paper does not explicitly define DAM subtypes. The lack of significant findings for non-AD variables (e.g., diabetes, vascular pathology) after correction suggests that microglial activation is tightly linked to AD pathology rather than general aging or comorbidities. Open questions remain regarding the precise functional roles of distinct microglial sub-states, their temporal dynamics, and their interactions with genetic risk factors such as APOE. The study’s findings are consistent with established models but highlight the need for further work integrating spatial, morphological, and genetic data to dissect microglial heterogeneity and its impact on disease progression and resilience. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on 1.3 million nuclei from 283 post-mortem samples across six brain regions (entorhinal cortex [EC], hippocampus [HC], anterior thalamus [TH], angular gyrus [AG], midtemporal cortex [MT], prefrontal cortex [PFC]) from 48 individuals (26 AD, 22 non-AD). Cell type annotation, gene module discovery (scdemon), and spatial/morphological validation (RNAscope, immunohistochemistry) were employed.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Regional Distribution**
Microglia/immune cells comprised ~7.9% of all nuclei, with lower abundance in neocortical regions compared to allocortex and thalamus. Regional differences in microglial abundance were consistent across individuals and not significantly altered by AD status at the major cell type level.

**Microglial Subtype Identification & Characterization**
The study identified microglia as a major cell class but did not report a detailed breakdown of microglial subtypes using unique nomenclature (e.g., DAM, Mic.1, etc.) as seen in some prior studies. Instead, microglial heterogeneity was primarily explored through gene expression modules and GWAS enrichment, rather than discrete subclustering.

- **Gene Expression Modules:** Microglial gene modules included identity programs (e.g., T cell, macrophage, cycling microglia [MKI67+]), and functional modules enriched for NF-κB signaling, interferon response, p53/DNA damage, and TGFβ signaling. These modules were largely shared across regions, with little evidence for strong region-specific microglial subtypes.
- **GWAS Enrichment:** Microglia and immune cells showed the highest enrichment for AD GWAS risk genes across all regions, with the TPT1+ microglial subtype and macrophages in HC, TH, and AG showing the strongest disease-relevance scores (<keyFinding priority='1'>Microglia are the principal cell type expressing AD GWAS risk genes, with region-specific expression of genes such as PLCG2 (EC), APOE and SORL1 (TH), and MS4A4A (MT)</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).
- **Region-Specific Expression:** Eight GWAS genes showed region-specific expression in microglia, but no evidence was found for region-specific microglial subtypes analogous to those in astrocytes or oligodendrocytes.

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**
- **AD-Associated Changes:** Microglial DEGs in AD were broadly enriched for upregulation of clathrin-coated endocytosis and downregulation of viral response genes. Region-specific enrichments included upregulation of MHC-II binding in EC and HC, RNA processing in TH, glycolysis in PFC and EC, and downregulation of phagocytosis and phospholipase signaling in HC.
- **Pathology-Specific Responses:** Microglial DEGs associated with neuritic plaque and NFT burden overlapped substantially with those for pathologic AD diagnosis. Microglia showed upregulation of glycolysis genes in response to diffuse plaques, with core glycolytic drivers (e.g., GAPDH, BNIP3L) upregulated in response to NFT burden and cognitive impairment (<keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial metabolic reprogramming (glycolysis, glycogen metabolism) is a prominent feature of AD pathology, especially in response to amyloid plaques</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).
- **GWAS and Familial AD Genes:** Of 149 AD risk genes, 75 were maximally expressed in microglia, and 30 were differentially expressed in microglia in AD, especially in regions with high neuritic plaque density (e.g., APOE, HLA-DRA, PILRA, SORT1).

**Cell-Cell Communication**
- Microglial ligand-receptor interactions were not a major focus, but the study notes that predicted cell-cell communication events were mostly shared across regions, with no microglia-specific regional interactions highlighted.

**Spatial/Morphological Validation**
- No specific spatial or morphological validation of microglial subtypes was reported, in contrast to the detailed in situ validation performed for astrocyte and neuronal subtypes.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**
- The study did not report microglial pseudotime or trajectory analyses, nor did it identify microglial subtypes associated with specific AD stages or aging transitions.

**Genetic and Host Modulators**
- Microglial modules were enriched for AD GWAS risk genes, and APOE-ε4 status was associated with increased expression of certain chaperone modules, but no strong genotype-specific microglial subtypes were described.

**Summary of Negative Findings**
- Unlike astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, microglia did not show strong region-specific subtypes or modules. The authors explicitly note that immune cells (including microglia) showed little regional specificity, and microglial responses to AD pathology were largely consistent across brain regions.

</findings>

<clinical>
Microglia are the principal cell type expressing and responding to AD GWAS risk genes, with broad upregulation of immune and metabolic pathways in AD, especially in response to amyloid plaques and NFTs. While microglial metabolic reprogramming (notably glycolysis and glycogen metabolism) is a prominent feature of AD pathology, the lack of strong region- or stage-specific microglial subtypes suggests a relatively uniform response across the brain. These findings reinforce the centrality of microglia in AD genetic risk and pathology, but suggest that therapeutic targeting may need to focus on shared, rather than region-specific, microglial programs. <keyFinding priority='1'>Microglia are the main cell type linking AD genetic risk to cellular pathology, but do not display the regional or subtype heterogeneity seen in astrocytes or neurons</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>.

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**
Microglia in this multiregion snRNA-seq atlas of Alzheimer’s disease are the principal cell type expressing AD GWAS risk genes, with region-specific expression of genes such as PLCG2 (EC), APOE and SORL1 (TH), and MS4A4A (MT). However, microglia do not display strong region- or disease-specific subtypes; instead, their response to AD is characterized by broad upregulation of immune and metabolic pathways (notably glycolysis) across all regions and pathologies. Microglial metabolic reprogramming is especially prominent in response to amyloid plaques, but no evidence for regionally restricted microglial states was found.

---

**Research Implications (≈150 words):**
This study provides a comprehensive, region-spanning atlas of microglial transcriptional states in the aged human brain, revealing that microglia are the main cellular hub for AD genetic risk and pathology-associated gene expression. However, the absence of strong region- or stage-specific microglial subtypes, in contrast to astrocytes and neurons, suggests that microglial responses to AD are largely uniform across brain regions. This finding aligns with some prior reports but contrasts with studies in mouse models or human cortex that have described disease-associated microglia (DAM) or regionally restricted microglial states. The authors do not explicitly discuss contradictions with prior models, but their data suggest that, at least in late-stage human AD, microglial heterogeneity is less pronounced than that of other glial or neuronal populations. Open questions include whether earlier disease stages or spatially resolved methods might reveal more microglial diversity, and how microglial metabolic reprogramming contributes to neurodegeneration and could be therapeutically targeted.

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) was performed on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC, Brodmann area 9) from 71 donors (37 MDD cases, 34 controls; 51% female). Over 160,000 nuclei were analyzed using a unified pipeline, with Harmony for batch correction and Seurat for clustering, yielding 41 clusters across 7 major cell types. Validation included comparison to published datasets and gene/protein expression confirmation in mouse microglia.
</methods>

**Differential Gene Expression & Pathway Enrichment:**  
In females, microglia (Mic1 cluster) exhibited the highest number of DEGs among all cell types (74/85 DEGs at the broad level; 68/180 at the cluster level, with 78% overlap). Most DEGs were upregulated (82% at broad, 78% at cluster level). Key marker genes included canonical microglial markers (CX3CR1, SPI1, TMEM119).  
Pathway analysis revealed:
- **Downregulation** of inflammatory/immune signaling: interferon gamma, IL-4/IL-13, IL-10, TNFR2/NF-κB pathways.
- **Upregulation** of neuronal system pathways: voltage-gated potassium channels, metabotropic glutamate receptors, neurexins/neuroligins, and ion channels.

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
- **Mic1 (microglia):** The only microglial cluster identified, defined by CX3CR1, SPI1, TMEM119. In females, Mic1 showed robust upregulation of neuronal and ion channel genes and downregulation of both pro- and anti-inflammatory immune genes.  
  - **Functional signature:** Suggests a shift away from classical inflammatory activation toward altered neuronal signaling and ion channel activity.
  - **Disease association:** Mic1 accounted for 38% of all female cluster-level DEGs, with 69% of these confirmed as both transcribed and translated in microglia (validated in mouse TRAP data).  
  - **Sex specificity:** Microglial DEGs were almost exclusively female-specific; males showed minimal microglial involvement.
  - **Spatial/morphological validation:** Not directly performed, but marker gene expression and cross-species validation support microglial identity.
  - **Trajectory:** No evidence for distinct disease-associated microglial subpopulations (e.g., DAM) as seen in neurodegeneration; rather, a global shift in microglial transcriptional state in females with MDD.
<keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
- **Sex:** Microglial transcriptional changes are highly female-specific; males show little to no microglial DEG enrichment.
- **Genetic/host factors:** No explicit genotype or risk allele associations reported for microglia in this study.
- **Meta-analysis:** Combining male and female data increased the number of microglial DEGs, supporting the robustness of the female signal.

**Gene Regulatory Networks:**

<keyFinding priority='2'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell-Cell Communication:**  
- Protein-protein interaction (STRING) and ligand-receptor (CellChat) analyses suggest altered microglia–PV interneuron crosstalk in females, with increased SPP1-integrin signaling and decreased GAS6-MERTK signaling. However, these findings are preliminary and not directly validated.

</findings>

<clinical>
Microglia in the female dlPFC show a unique, disease-associated transcriptional profile in MDD, characterized by upregulation of neuronal/ion channel genes and downregulation of inflammatory pathways. This pattern is not observed in males, suggesting sex-specific microglial involvement in MDD pathophysiology. The findings imply that microglial dysfunction in females may contribute to altered neuronal signaling and synaptic regulation, potentially underlying sex differences in depression risk and symptomatology. While these results highlight microglia as a potential therapeutic target in female MDD, causality cannot be inferred from cross-sectional data. <keyFinding priority='1'><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications**

This study provides strong evidence for a female-specific microglial transcriptional signature in MDD, distinct from the male pattern and from microglial states described in neurodegeneration. The upregulation of neuronal and ion channel genes, alongside downregulation of both pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways, suggests a non-canonical microglial activation state in female depression. Open questions include whether these changes reflect altered microglial-neuronal communication, hormonal modulation, or unique stress responses. The absence of distinct disease-associated microglial subtypes (e.g., DAM) and the lack of spatial/morphological validation are notable limitations. Future work should integrate spatial transcriptomics, protein-level validation, and genetic risk mapping to clarify the causal role and therapeutic potential of microglia in sex-specific depression mechanisms. The findings are consistent with, but extend, prior models of microglial involvement in psychiatric disease, and do not contradict established neurodegenerative microglial paradigms. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Microglia, particularly the MG2 (disease-associated) subtype, are central to the inflammatory and phagocytic response in both sporadic and genetic AD. Their expansion and activation are tightly linked to amyloid pathology, genetic risk, and disease progression. The upregulation of complement and lipid metabolism genes in MG2 suggests a role in both amyloid clearance and neuroinflammation, potentially contributing to neuronal injury. The strong association of MG2 with AD risk loci and amyloid proximity highlights microglial activation as a candidate therapeutic target and biomarker for disease progression, especially in genetically at-risk populations (e.g., DSAD, APOE ε4 carriers).

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**
This study reveals that microglia in both sporadic and Down syndrome-associated Alzheimer’s disease (AD) undergo marked shifts from homeostatic (MG1) to disease-associated (MG2) states, particularly in upper cortical layers and white matter. MG2 microglia are defined by upregulation of complement (C1QB, C3), lipid metabolism (APOE, CLU), and inflammatory genes, and are strongly enriched for AD genetic risk loci. Their expansion correlates with amyloid pathology, disease stage, and is more pronounced in females. The MG2/M11 network is a key hub linking microglial activation to AD risk and pathology.

<methods>
The authors performed single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) on postmortem human frontal cortex (FCX) and posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) from controls, early-stage AD, late-stage AD, and Down syndrome AD (DSAD). Mouse 5xFAD amyloid model brains (4–12 months) were also profiled. snRNA-seq data (n=585,042 nuclei) were integrated with three prior AD studies. Imaging mass cytometry (IMC) and immunofluorescence validated key findings.
</methods>

<findings>
Microglia (MG) exhibited pronounced and regionally patterned shifts in cell state composition across AD subtypes. Differential abundance analysis revealed that microglial states are dynamically altered, with expansion of disease-associated subpopulations (MG2) and depletion of homeostatic microglia (MG1) in both DSAD and late-stage AD, especially in upper cortical layers and white matter.

**Microglial Subtypes:**
- **MG1 (Homeostatic Microglia):** Characterized by high expression of P2RY12, TMEM119, and CX3CR1, these microglia maintain surveillance and homeostasis. MG1 is depleted in regions with high pathology, particularly in DSAD and late-stage AD, indicating a loss of homeostatic function as disease progresses. <keyFinding priority='2'>Homeostatic microglia are selectively lost in regions of high amyloid and tau pathology.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Spatial and Morphological Validation:**
IMC confirmed increased C1QB and CLU protein in microglia in DSAD and late-stage AD, with spatial colocalization to amyloid plaques. Microglial activation (C1QB, M11 module) is higher in females with DSAD, especially in white matter, validated at the protein level.

**Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment:**
MG2 microglia upregulate complement genes (C1QB, C3), phagocytic markers (CD44, SPP1), and lipid metabolism genes (APOE, CLU). Pathway enrichment analyses highlight inflammatory response, complement activation, neuronal death, and amyloid clearance as prominent in MG2. MG2 marker genes overlap with the M11 meta-module (spatial co-expression network), which is upregulated in upper cortical layers in both DSAD and late-stage AD and is enriched for AD GWAS risk genes (CLU, C1QB, CD44, ADAMTS1).

**Modulators and Metrics:**
AD genetic risk (scDRS) is significantly enriched in MG1 and MG2 clusters across all snRNA-seq datasets, with the strongest correlation in MG2 (activated microglia). MG2 activation is quantitatively associated with polygenic AD risk and increases with disease stage and amyloid burden. Sex differences are evident, with microglial activation (C1QB, M11 module) higher in females with DSAD, especially in white matter.

**Aging/Disease Trajectory:**
In 5xFAD mice, microglial activation and AD risk enrichment increase with age, paralleling amyloid accumulation. Pseudotime and cross-sectional analyses indicate a shift from MG1 to MG2 with increasing pathology, amyloid load, and age in both human and mouse data.

**Gene Regulatory Networks:**
The M11 meta-module (spatial co-expression) is a key regulatory network in disease-associated microglia, containing hub genes C1QB, CLU, CD44, and ADAMTS1. M11 is upregulated in upper cortical layers and correlates with AD risk and amyloid proximity.

**Cell-Cell Communication:**
Disease-associated microglia participate in altered signaling networks, including upregulated ANGPTL4 (astrocyte-microglia) and downregulated NECTIN and CD99 pathways in DSAD, suggesting disrupted glial-neuronal and glial-vascular communication.

**Spatial Analysis:**
Disease-associated microglia (MG2) are spatially enriched in upper cortical layers and amyloid plaque hotspots, validated by IMC and spatial transcriptomics.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**
MG2 marker genes and M11 module members are significantly enriched for AD GWAS risk loci (APOE, CLU, ADAMTS1, C1QB).

**Research Implications (≈150 words):**
This study robustly demonstrates that microglial heterogeneity in AD is dominated by a shift from homeostatic (MG1) to disease-associated (MG2) states, with MG2 microglia acting as a nexus for genetic risk, amyloid pathology, and inflammatory signaling. The MG2/M11 network aligns with previously described DAM/ARM/IRM states but is further refined here by spatial and genetic context, especially in DSAD. Open questions include the causal role of MG2 in neurodegeneration versus protection, the reversibility of MG2 activation, and the precise triggers (amyloid, tau, vascular, or systemic) for microglial state transitions. The strong sex effect on microglial activation in DSAD warrants further study. The findings are largely concordant with prior DAM/IRM models but extend them by integrating spatial, genetic, and multi-omic data. Future work should address longitudinal dynamics, functional consequences of MG2 activation, and therapeutic modulation of microglial states in both sporadic and genetic AD.

</metadata>

<methods>
This study performed both single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) and single-nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) on postmortem human prefrontal cortex (PFC) tissue from late-stage AD patients and age-matched controls. Integration of transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility data was achieved using Seurat and other computational frameworks, with batch correction and rigorous cluster annotation. Validation included immunostaining, in situ hybridization, and coexpression network analysis.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Identification**  
The study identified three main microglial subpopulations in snRNA-seq (MG1–3) and five in snATAC-seq (MG.a–e). Notably, the proportions of MG.a and MG.b (snATAC-seq) were significantly increased in late-stage AD (FDR = 9.82 × 10⁻⁷ and 8.88 × 10⁻¹⁰), both mapping to the activated snRNA-seq cluster MG1 (SPP1^high/CD163^+), which was also increased in AD (FDR = 6.32 × 10⁻⁷). These clusters represent disease-associated microglia (DAM)-like states, while MG2 (CX3CR1^+) represents homeostatic microglia.  
<keyFinding priority='1'>Activated microglial subtypes (MG.a, MG.b/MG1) are expanded in late-stage AD, with strong upregulation of SPP1 and CD163, and depletion of homeostatic markers (e.g., CX3CR1).</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Defining Marker Genes and Functional Signatures**  
- **MG1 (snRNA-seq):** SPP1^high, CD163^+, upregulated in AD; associated with phagocytic and inflammatory signatures.
- **MG2 (snRNA-seq):** CX3CR1^+, homeostatic, relatively depleted in AD.
- **MG.a/MG.b (snATAC-seq):** Map to MG1, show increased SPI1 (PU.1) motif variability and upregulation of DAM markers.
- **MG.c–e:** Less clearly defined, not strongly associated with AD status.

**Pathway Enrichment and Differential Expression**  
Disease-associated microglia (DAM) subtypes show upregulation of genes involved in phagocytosis, lipid metabolism, and immune response (e.g., SPP1, CD163, F13A1, APOE). Homeostatic microglia express CX3CR1, P2RY12, and TMEM119, which are downregulated in AD.

**Trajectory and Temporal Modelling**  
Pseudotime trajectory analysis revealed a shift from homeostatic to DAM-like states in AD, with a significant increase in the proportion of AD nuclei along the trajectory (Pearson R = 0.53, P = 6.9 × 10⁻⁵). The trajectory recapitulates a decrease in homeostatic signature, an increase in stage 1 DAM signature, and a depletion of stage 2 (TREM2-dependent) DAM signature, suggesting a partial or altered DAM activation in human AD compared to mouse models.  
<keyFinding priority='1'>Microglial trajectories in AD brains show a progressive loss of homeostatic identity and partial acquisition of DAM features, but with a distinct depletion of TREM2-dependent DAM signature.</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>
The authors note that the depletion of stage 2 DAM (TREM2-dependent) signature in human AD contrasts with some mouse model findings, suggesting species or disease-stage differences.

**Transcription Factor Regulation**  
SPI1 (PU.1) motif variability is significantly increased in activated microglia (MG.a, MG.b) in AD, but its target genes are downregulated in MG1, suggesting a complex or repressive regulatory role in late-stage AD. ETV5, another ETS family TF, is also upregulated in AD microglia.  
<keyFinding priority='2'>SPI1 motif activity is increased in AD microglia, but its targets are paradoxically downregulated, indicating possible context-dependent repression.</keyFinding>

**Genetic Modulators and GWAS Integration**  
All five microglia clusters showed significant enrichment for AD GWAS SNPs, especially those from large meta-analyses (Jansen et al., Kunkle et al.). Enrichment of AD-associated SNPs was particularly strong in DAM-like microglia and increased along the microglial pseudotime trajectory, especially in distal enhancer regions.

**Spatial/Morphological Validation**  
Immunostaining and in situ hybridization confirmed increased SPP1 and CD163 expression in microglia in AD tissue, supporting the transcriptomic findings.

**Summary of Subtypes**  
- **Homeostatic microglia (MG2):** CX3CR1^+, P2RY12^+, TMEM119^+; depleted in AD.
- **DAM-like microglia (MG1/MG.a/MG.b):** SPP1^high, CD163^+, F13A1^+, APOE^+; expanded in AD, enriched for AD risk variants, upregulated SPI1 motif activity.
- **Intermediate/other subtypes:** Not strongly associated with AD or less well characterized.

</findings>

<clinical>
Microglia in late-stage AD undergo a shift from homeostatic to disease-associated (DAM-like) states, characterized by upregulation of phagocytic, inflammatory, and lipid metabolism genes, and expansion of SPP1^high/CD163^+ subtypes. These DAM-like microglia are the primary cell type in which AD genetic risk variants are accessible, implicating them as key mediators of genetic susceptibility. The partial depletion of TREM2-dependent DAM signatures in human AD suggests differences from mouse models and may reflect altered or incomplete activation. SPI1/PU.1 emerges as a central, but potentially repressive, regulator in late-stage AD microglia. These findings highlight microglial subtypes as potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers, especially those enriched for AD risk variants and DAM-like features.

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**  
In late-stage Alzheimer’s disease, microglia shift from homeostatic (CX3CR1^+) to disease-associated (SPP1^high/CD163^+) states, with DAM-like subtypes (MG1/MG.a/MG.b) significantly expanded and enriched for AD genetic risk variants. These activated microglia upregulate phagocytic and lipid metabolism genes, show increased SPI1 (PU.1) motif activity, and are the principal cell type where AD GWAS SNPs are accessible. Notably, the TREM2-dependent DAM signature is depleted in human AD, diverging from mouse models.

---

**Research Implications (≈150 words):**  
This study provides a comprehensive multi-omic map of microglial heterogeneity in human AD, revealing that DAM-like microglia are the main cellular context for AD genetic risk and are transcriptionally distinct from homeostatic microglia. The depletion of TREM2-dependent DAM signatures in human AD, compared to mouse models, raises important questions about species differences and the relevance of mouse DAM paradigms to human disease. The paradoxical increase in SPI1 motif activity alongside downregulation of its targets suggests complex, context-dependent regulation in late-stage AD. Future research should clarify the functional consequences of these DAM-like states, their relationship to neurodegeneration, and their potential as therapeutic targets. The alignment of DAM markers with those described in mouse models is partial, and the study explicitly discusses these differences, highlighting the need for human-specific validation of microglial activation states in AD.  
<contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>
The authors note that the depletion of TREM2-dependent DAM signatures in human AD contrasts with findings in 5XFAD mouse models, suggesting either species-specific or disease-stage-specific differences in microglial activation.

Disease focus: Major Depressive Disorder (MDD)
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on ~80,000 nuclei from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA9) of 17 male MDD cases (all died by suicide) and 17 matched male controls. Droplet-based 10x Genomics technology was used. Cell type annotation was based on canonical marker genes. Differential expression was assessed within each cluster. Validation included FANS-sorted nuclei with high-throughput qPCR and RNAScope in situ hybridization.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Identification:**  
Microglia were identified as a distinct "Micro/Macro" cluster using canonical markers (SPI1, MRC1, TMEM119, CX3CR1). The cluster included both microglia and macrophages, but the majority of cells expressed microglial markers. The number of microglia/macrophage nuclei was relatively small compared to neuronal clusters, reflecting known technical limitations of snRNA-seq in recovering glia from human postmortem tissue. There was no report of significant difference in the proportion of microglia between MDD cases and controls.

**Microglial Subtypes and States:**  
The study did not report further subclustering or identification of distinct microglial subtypes or activation states within the microglia/macrophage cluster. The cluster was treated as a single population for downstream analyses.

**Differential Gene Expression:**  
Within the microglia/macrophage cluster, the authors did not identify any genes that were significantly differentially expressed between MDD cases and controls at their chosen FDR threshold (FDR < 0.10). This is explicitly stated in the main text and supplementary tables: microglia/macrophage did not show significant transcriptional changes associated with MDD in this dataset.

**Pathway Enrichment, Functional Signatures, and Disease Association:**  
Because no significant DEGs were found in microglia, there were no pathway enrichment or functional analyses specific to this cell type. The authors did not report any microglial-specific changes in immune, inflammatory, or phagocytic pathways in MDD.

**Spatial/Morphological Validation:**  
No spatial, morphological, or in situ validation was performed for microglia, as no significant findings were reported for this cell type.

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
No associations were reported between microglial gene expression and host factors (age, sex, genotype), nor were any quantitative activation or morphology scores applied to microglia.

**Cell-Cell Communication:**  
Although the study performed ligand-receptor analyses between other cell types (notably deep-layer excitatory neurons and OPCs), microglia were not highlighted as major participants in altered cell-cell communication in MDD.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
No pseudotime or trajectory analyses were performed for microglia.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
No eQTL or genetic risk variant analyses were reported for microglia.

<keyFinding priority='3'>
The absence of significant microglial transcriptional changes in MDD is a notable negative result, especially given the literature implicating neuroinflammation in depression.
</keyFinding>

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
The study found no evidence for microglial involvement in the transcriptional pathology of MDD in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at the single-nucleus level. This suggests that, at least in this brain region and cohort, microglia do not exhibit major disease-associated transcriptional changes detectable by snRNA-seq. The authors note that this contrasts with findings in other neurological and psychiatric disorders where microglial activation is prominent, and with some prior hypotheses about neuroinflammation in depression. However, they caution that technical limitations (e.g., low glial recovery, lack of subclustering) may have limited sensitivity to detect subtle or rare microglial states.

**Quick Reference (≈50–100 words):**  
In this snRNA-seq study of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in major depressive disorder (MDD), microglia were identified as a distinct cluster but showed no significant changes in gene expression, subtypes, or proportion between MDD cases and controls. No disease-associated microglial states or marker genes were detected, and no host or genetic modulators were identified. This negative finding is robust within the study’s technical constraints.

**Detailed Summary (≈800–1000 words):**  
<metadata>
Nagy et al. (2020) conducted a single-nucleus RNA sequencing study of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA9) in 17 male individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) who died by suicide and 17 matched male controls. The study aimed to resolve cell-type-specific transcriptional changes in MDD, using droplet-based snRNA-seq to profile ~80,000 nuclei. Cell type annotation was based on canonical markers, and differential expression was assessed within each cluster. Validation included FANS-sorted nuclei with high-throughput qPCR and RNAScope in situ hybridization.
</metadata>

<methods>
The authors used a custom filtering strategy to maximize recovery of glial cells, which are typically underrepresented in snRNA-seq of human postmortem brain. After clustering, 26 distinct cell populations were identified, including a "Micro/Macro" cluster defined by expression of microglial markers (SPI1, MRC1, TMEM119, CX3CR1). The cluster likely included both microglia and perivascular macrophages, but the majority of cells expressed canonical microglial genes. The number of microglial nuclei was relatively small compared to neuronal clusters, reflecting both biological abundance and technical limitations. No significant differences in cell type proportions were reported between cases and controls.
</methods>

<findings>
The microglia/macrophage cluster was treated as a single population for downstream analyses. The authors did not report further subclustering or identification of distinct microglial subtypes or activation states. This is a key methodological point, as it limits the ability to detect rare or subtle disease-associated microglial states.

Differential gene expression analysis within the microglia/macrophage cluster revealed no genes that were significantly differentially expressed between MDD cases and controls at the chosen FDR threshold (FDR < 0.10). This result was consistent across all statistical models and was explicitly stated in both the main text and supplementary materials. As a result, no pathway enrichment or functional analyses were performed for microglia, and no microglial-specific changes in immune, inflammatory, or phagocytic pathways were reported.

No spatial, morphological, or in situ validation was performed for microglia, as no significant findings were reported for this cell type. Similarly, no associations were reported between microglial gene expression and host factors (age, sex, genotype), nor were any quantitative activation or morphology scores applied to microglia.

Although the study performed ligand-receptor analyses to explore altered cell-cell communication in MDD, microglia were not highlighted as major participants in these networks. The focus of cell-cell communication analyses was on deep-layer excitatory neurons and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs), which showed the most pronounced transcriptional changes in MDD.

No pseudotime or trajectory analyses were performed for microglia, and no eQTL or genetic risk variant analyses were reported for this cell type.

<keyFinding priority='3'>
The absence of significant microglial transcriptional changes in MDD is a notable negative result, especially given the literature implicating neuroinflammation in depression. The authors explicitly note this finding and discuss possible explanations, including technical limitations (e.g., low glial recovery, lack of subclustering) and the possibility that microglial changes in MDD may be subtle, region-specific, or post-transcriptional.
</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
The study found no evidence for microglial involvement in the transcriptional pathology of MDD in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at the single-nucleus level. This suggests that, at least in this brain region and cohort, microglia do not exhibit major disease-associated transcriptional changes detectable by snRNA-seq. The authors note that this contrasts with findings in other neurological and psychiatric disorders where microglial activation is prominent, and with some prior hypotheses about neuroinflammation in depression. However, they caution that technical limitations (e.g., low glial recovery, lack of subclustering) may have limited sensitivity to detect subtle or rare microglial states.
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words):**  
The lack of significant microglial transcriptional changes in this study raises important questions about the role of microglia in MDD, at least in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. This negative result stands in contrast to some prior models of depression that emphasize neuroinflammation and microglial activation. The authors suggest that technical limitations—such as low recovery of glial nuclei, lack of subclustering, and potential insensitivity to rare or subtle microglial states—may have contributed to the absence of findings. Future studies with improved glial recovery, higher resolution subclustering, and spatial transcriptomics may be needed to fully assess microglial heterogeneity and activation in MDD. Additionally, other brain regions or disease stages may reveal microglial involvement not captured here. The findings do not contradict prior models directly, but rather highlight the need for more sensitive and comprehensive approaches to microglial profiling in psychiatric disorders.

# summary for Olah 2020 (microglia)

**Quick Reference**

This study (Olah et al., 2020, Nat Commun) used single-cell RNA sequencing of live human microglia from cortex to define nine distinct microglial subtypes, including two major homeostatic clusters and several disease- or function-associated states. Notably, cluster 7—characterized by high expression of antigen presentation genes (e.g., CD74)—is reduced in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) cortex, a finding validated both histologically and in independent snRNA-seq data. The abundance of this subtype is modulated by AD pathology rather than age or sex.

**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Structure**
The authors identified nine robust microglial clusters (MG1–MG9), present across both autopsy and surgical samples, with clusters 1 and 2 comprising the majority of microglia in all individuals. These two clusters are proposed as homeostatic microglia, lacking unique upregulated marker genes but expressing canonical microglial markers (e.g., C1QA, AIF1, CD14). Their proportions are stable across disease, age, and region, suggesting a baseline surveillance or maintenance role. <keyFinding priority='2'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Subtype Characterization**
- **Cluster 1 & 2 (Homeostatic):** Express high levels of C1QA, AIF1, CD14, but lack distinct upregulated transcription factors or surface markers. These clusters form a continuum and are the most abundant in all samples. <keyFinding priority='2'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **Cluster 3 (Stress-Response):** Enriched for stress-induced genes (e.g., HSPA1A/B, DDIT4, FOS, JUN), likely reflecting cellular stress from tissue processing or aging. This cluster is more prevalent in autopsy than surgical samples and was excluded from functional annotation due to its likely artifact status. <keyFinding priority='3'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **Cluster 4 (Interferon-Responsive):** Defined by upregulation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISG15, IFIT1, IFIT3, IRF7, IRF8), and enriched for interferon signaling pathways. This cluster is also enriched for multiple sclerosis (MS) and demyelinating disease genes. <keyFinding priority='2'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **Clusters 5 & 6 (Cytokine/Anti-inflammatory):** Share upregulation of genes involved in anti-inflammatory signaling (IL-10, IL-4, IL-13 pathways), and express CD83. These clusters are more frequent in surgical samples and show enrichment for neurovascular and inflammatory disease genes. <keyFinding priority='2'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **Cluster 7 (Antigen-Presenting, Disease-Associated):** Marked by high expression of antigen presentation genes (CD74, HLA-DRB1, HLA-DMB, CD68), with a ~2-fold increase in CD74 compared to other clusters. This cluster is most enriched for genes downregulated in AD cortex and for the murine DAM (disease-associated microglia) signature. Cluster 7 microglia are significantly reduced in frequency in AD, as shown by both IHC (CD74^high^/IBA1^+^ cells) and independent snRNA-seq mapping. <keyFinding priority='1'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **Cluster 8 (Metabolic/Stress):** Shows upregulation of genes related to metabolism and stress, but is less well characterized.
- **Cluster 9 (Proliferative):** Defined by cell cycle and proliferation genes (PCNA, MKI67, TOP2A, RRM2), representing a small pool of dividing microglia. This cluster is not detected in snRNA-seq data from frozen tissue, suggesting a possible loss of proliferative cells during nuclear isolation. <keyFinding priority='2'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Validation and Spatial/Morphological Data**
- IHC confirmed the existence and relative abundance of clusters 4 (ISG15^+^), 5/6 (CD83^+^), 7 (CD74^high^), and 9 (PCNA^+^) microglia in situ, with morphologies consistent with parenchymal microglia.
- Cluster 7 (CD74^high^) microglia are not specifically enriched around amyloid plaques, suggesting their reduction in AD is not simply due to plaque proximity.

**Disease and Genetic Associations**
- Cluster 7 is the only subtype whose gene signature is significantly reduced in AD cortex (both clinical and pathological diagnosis), as shown by bulk RNA-seq and snRNA-seq mapping.
- Cluster 4 is enriched for MS and demyelination genes; clusters 5/6 for neurovascular and inflammatory diseases.
- GWAS risk genes for AD (e.g., TREM2, APOE) are expressed across clusters, but TREM2 is higher in cluster 7 and IFITM3 in cluster 4.
- No significant modulation by age or sex was observed for cluster 7 abundance; reduction is specific to AD pathology.

**Comparison to Mouse Models and Other Datasets**
- The murine DAM signature is distributed across several human clusters, but cluster 7 shows the strongest enrichment.
- The overall microglial population structure is robustly replicated in an independent human scRNA-seq dataset (Sankowski et al.), though some clusters (e.g., proliferative) are less well represented in snRNA-seq data.
- The study explicitly notes that the DAM and interferon-response programs are not confined to single clusters in human microglia, in contrast to mouse models. <contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag> (Authors discuss that the DAM signature is less coherent and more distributed in human microglia than in mouse models.)

</findings>

<clinical>
The study identifies cluster 7 microglia as a disease-associated, antigen-presenting subtype that is selectively reduced in AD cortex, suggesting a potential loss of a protective or regulatory microglial function in AD. This reduction is not observed for total microglial numbers, indicating a specific vulnerability of this subtype. The findings imply that therapies aiming to modulate microglia in AD should consider the heterogeneity of microglial states, particularly the preservation or restoration of cluster 7. The study also provides validated markers (e.g., CD74^high^) for in situ identification of this subtype, which may serve as a biomarker for disease progression or therapeutic response. <keyFinding priority='1'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
</clinical>

**Research Implications**

This work establishes a foundational map of human microglial heterogeneity, highlighting the existence of a disease-associated, antigen-presenting microglial subtype (cluster 7) that is selectively depleted in Alzheimer’s disease. The study’s integration of scRNA-seq, histological validation, and cross-dataset replication strengthens confidence in these findings. Open questions remain regarding the functional role of cluster 7—whether its loss contributes causally to AD pathology or reflects a downstream effect—and whether similar subtypes exist in other brain regions or neurological diseases. The distribution of the DAM signature across multiple human clusters, rather than a single population as in mouse models, suggests important species differences in microglial responses to neurodegeneration. Future research should focus on the mechanistic role of cluster 7 in AD, its potential as a therapeutic target, and the development of strategies to preserve or restore this subtype. The study’s marker-based approach (e.g., CD74^high^) enables further in situ and functional studies, and the data provide a reference for aligning future single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analyses. <contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag> (Authors explicitly discuss that the DAM signature is less discrete in human microglia than in mouse models, highlighting a key departure from prior animal-based models.)

Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with a focus on neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology in human prefrontal cortex (BA9).
</metadata>

<methods>
This study developed a FACS-based method to isolate and profile single neuronal somas with and without NFTs from fresh-frozen human AD brain tissue (Braak VI) and age-matched controls. Over 120,000 single-cell transcriptomes were generated (snRNA-seq and single-soma RNA-seq), enabling comparison of NFT-bearing and NFT-free neurons across 20 neocortical subtypes. Morphological and spatial validation was performed using immunohistochemistry (IHC), in situ hybridization (ISH), and quantitative histology.
</methods>

<findings>
**Microglia: Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Analysis**
The primary focus of this study was on neuronal populations and their susceptibility to NFT formation and death. Microglia were not a central focus, and the paper does not provide a detailed analysis of microglial subtypes, activation states, or transcriptomic changes in microglia in relation to NFT pathology. The single-cell and single-nucleus datasets were generated from FACS-sorted neuronal somas (MAP2+), and the clustering and downstream analyses were restricted to excitatory and inhibitory neuronal subtypes. Glial cells, including microglia, were only briefly mentioned in the context of method validation (e.g., the ability to isolate MAP2–/AT8+ glial cells from progressive supranuclear palsy [PSP] brains), but no systematic profiling or characterization of microglial populations was performed in the AD or control samples.

**Cell Type Proportions:**  
There is no quantitative data or discussion of microglial abundance, proliferation, or loss in AD versus control tissue in this study. The cell isolation and FACS gating strategy specifically excluded non-neuronal (MAP2–) cells from the main AD and control datasets.

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment:**  
No microglia-specific differential gene expression or pathway enrichment analyses were reported. The study’s pathway analyses (e.g., synaptic signaling, oxidative phosphorylation, apoptosis) were performed exclusively on neuronal clusters.

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
No microglial subtypes or states (e.g., homeostatic, disease-associated microglia [DAM], activated, proliferative) were identified or characterized. The study did not report marker genes, functional signatures, or disease associations for microglial populations.

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
No host or genetic factors (e.g., APOE genotype, age, sex) were analyzed in relation to microglial states or abundance.

**Gene Regulatory Networks, Cell-Cell Communication, Spatial Analysis:**  
No microglia-specific gene regulatory networks, ligand-receptor interactions, or spatial/morphological validation of microglial states were presented.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories, Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
No temporal modeling, pseudotime analysis, or integration with GWAS/eQTL data was performed for microglia.

**Quick Reference (≈50–100 words):**
This study does not analyze microglia in the context of Alzheimer’s disease. The single-cell transcriptomic profiling and downstream analyses were restricted to neuronal somas, with no data or findings reported for microglial subtypes, marker genes, or disease associations. As such, no conclusions regarding microglial heterogeneity, activation, or involvement in NFT pathology can be drawn from this work.

**Detailed Summary (≈800–1000 words):**
The paper by Otero-Garcia et al. (2022) presents a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic analysis of neuronal vulnerability to neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) using a novel FACS-based method to isolate and profile single neuronal somas from human prefrontal cortex. The study’s primary aim was to resolve the molecular signatures distinguishing NFT-prone from NFT-resistant neuronal subtypes and to uncouple NFT susceptibility from neuronal death. Over 120,000 single-cell transcriptomes were generated from both AD and control brains, with a focus on 20 neocortical neuronal subtypes.

However, microglia were not a focus of this investigation. The cell isolation protocol specifically targeted MAP2+ neuronal somas, and the main datasets and clustering analyses were restricted to excitatory and inhibitory neurons. While the authors briefly mention that their FACS method could, in principle, be used to isolate glial cells with tau aggregates (as demonstrated in PSP tissue), no such analysis was performed for microglia in the AD or control samples. There is no mention of microglial marker genes, subtypes, or activation states in the results, figures, or supplementary materials.

Consequently, the study does not report on:
- Microglial cell type proportions or changes in AD versus control.
- Differential gene expression or pathway enrichment in microglia.
- Identification or characterization of microglial subtypes (e.g., homeostatic, DAM, proliferative).
- Associations between microglial states and NFT burden, amyloid pathology, or clinical variables.
- Morphological or spatial validation of microglial activation or clustering.
- Modulation of microglial states by host or genetic factors (e.g., APOE, age, sex).
- Microglia-specific gene regulatory networks, ligand-receptor interactions, or cell-cell communication.
- Temporal modeling or disease trajectory analysis for microglia.
- Integration of microglial transcriptomes with GWAS or eQTL data.

The absence of microglial data is a direct consequence of the study’s design, which prioritized neuronal profiling to address questions of selective neuronal vulnerability to tau pathology. The authors do not discuss microglial findings from other studies, nor do they comment on the potential role of microglia in NFT formation or neurodegeneration within their own data.

<keyFinding priority='3'>
The lack of microglial analysis is a clear limitation for those interested in glial contributions to AD, but it is consistent with the study’s stated aims and methodology.
</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

---

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words):**
This study provides no new information on microglial heterogeneity, activation, or disease association in Alzheimer’s disease. The absence of microglial data highlights a gap in the single-cell landscape of AD presented here, especially given the growing recognition of microglia as key modulators of neurodegeneration and tau pathology in other recent sc/snRNA-seq studies. Future work using similar high-throughput single-cell approaches should include microglia and other glial populations to enable a more comprehensive understanding of cell-type-specific responses to tau aggregation and neurodegeneration. Integration of neuronal and microglial transcriptomic data, particularly in spatial context, will be essential to elucidate cell-cell interactions and the contribution of microglial states (e.g., DAM, interferon-responsive, proliferative) to AD progression and NFT pathology. The authors’ FACS-based method could, in principle, be adapted for microglial profiling, but such analyses remain to be performed.

# summary for Pfisterer 2020 (microglia)

1) **Quick Reference (Microglia in Pfisterer et al., 2020, Nat Commun)**

This single-nucleus RNA-seq study of human temporal cortex in epilepsy (TLE) primarily focuses on neuronal subtypes, with only minimal analysis of microglia. Microglia were present in the NeuN-negative fraction, but the paper reports no significant disease-associated changes, subtypes, or transcriptomic shifts in microglia between epileptic and control samples. Demographic and pathological drivers of microglial states are not discussed.

Disease focus: Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE)
</metadata>

<methods>
The study uses single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) via 10x Genomics and Smart-seq2 on human temporal cortex samples from TLE patients and non-epileptic controls. Both NeuN-positive (neuronal) and NeuN-negative (non-neuronal, including glia) nuclei were isolated and sequenced. The main analysis centers on >110,000 neuronal nuclei, but a subset of four samples (two TLE, two controls) underwent snRNA-seq of the NeuN-negative fraction to profile glial and other non-neuronal populations.
</methods>

<findings>
The primary focus of the study is on neuronal diversity and disease-associated neuronal subtypes. Microglia are only briefly mentioned in the context of quality control and cell-type annotation. Specifically, the authors state that the NeuN-negative fraction, sequenced from a subset of samples, "came from glial and other nonneuronal populations" and that "only a very small proportion within this population displayed a neuronal identity" (Supplementary Fig. 1c–e). There is no further breakdown or analysis of microglial subtypes, marker genes, or disease-associated states.

- **Cell Type Proportions:** The paper does not report quantitative changes in microglial abundance between epilepsy and control samples.
- **Differential Gene Expression:** No microglia-specific differential expression analysis is presented.

3) **Research Implications**

This study provides no substantive data on microglial heterogeneity, activation states, or disease association in human temporal lobe epilepsy. The lack of microglial analysis is a notable gap, especially given the growing recognition of microglia in epilepsy pathophysiology. Future research should leverage single-cell/nucleus approaches to systematically characterize microglial subtypes, activation markers (e.g., TMEM119, P2RY12, CD68, APOE), and their relationship to neuronal pathology in epilepsy. The absence of microglial findings here neither supports nor contradicts prior models, as the authors do not discuss or compare their glial data to previous literature. This highlights the need for dedicated glial-focused single-cell studies in human epilepsy.

Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on post-mortem primary motor cortex (MCX, BA4) and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (PFC, BA9) from 73 donors (ALS, FTLD, and controls). 625,973 nuclei were profiled and annotated into 44 transcriptional subtypes, including microglia. Validation included immunohistochemistry and spatial quantification for select findings.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and General Patterns**  
Microglia were robustly recovered and annotated as a distinct glial cluster. The study does not report major changes in overall microglial abundance across disease groups, focusing instead on transcriptional state changes.

**Microglial Differential Gene Expression and Pathways**  
Microglia in ALS and FTLD exhibited a shift from homeostatic to partially activated/disease-associated states, but the magnitude and breadth of these changes were less pronounced than in neurons or some other glial types.  
- **Downregulation of Homeostatic Markers:**  
  - CSF1R and CX3CR1, canonical homeostatic microglial genes, were downregulated in both ALS and FTLD, consistent with a loss of homeostatic identity.

  - Some upregulation of disease-associated microglia (DAM) markers was observed, including GNAS, IL18, and SPP1, previously reported in ALS spinal cord and mouse models.

  - <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>  
  - <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **Pathway Enrichment:**  
  - GO enrichment in microglia highlighted terms related to synapse assembly, antigen processing, and regulation of immune response, but these were less prominent than in neurons or astrocytes.
- **Spatial/Morphological Validation:**  
  - No specific spatial or morphological validation of microglial subtypes was reported in this study.

**Microglial Subtype Characterization**  
The study does not identify multiple distinct microglial subtypes or states beyond the general homeostatic-to-activated spectrum. Instead, it reports a partial shift in gene expression consistent with a mild or incomplete DAM/ARM transition.
- **Homeostatic Microglia:**  
  - Defined by high CSF1R and CX3CR1 expression; relatively decreased in disease.
- **Partially Activated/Disease-Associated Microglia:**  
  - Defined by upregulation of GNAS, IL18, SPP1; partial overlap with previously described DAM/ARM states.
  - No evidence for a full DAM or pro-inflammatory microglial state as seen in some mouse models or in ALS spinal cord.

**Modulators & Metrics**  
- No strong evidence for modulation of microglial states by genotype (sporadic vs. C9orf72), region (MCX vs. PFC), or clinical variables is presented for microglia specifically.
- The authors note that snRNA-seq may under-detect microglial activation genes due to technical limitations, referencing prior work.
  - <keyFinding priority='3'>The limited detection of microglial activation signatures may reflect technical constraints of nuclear profiling.</keyFinding>  
  - <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>

**Gene Regulatory Networks and Cell-Cell Communication**  
- No specific microglial transcription factors or ligand-receptor interactions are highlighted as major findings in this study.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**  
- No pseudotime or trajectory analysis is reported for microglia.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**  
- No direct link between microglial subtypes and ALS/FTLD GWAS risk variants is reported.

</findings>

<clinical>
Microglia in ALS and FTLD show a partial loss of homeostatic identity and upregulation of select disease-associated markers, consistent with a mild or incomplete activation state. This suggests microglia may contribute to disease pathogenesis through altered support or immune signaling, but the lack of a robust DAM or pro-inflammatory signature indicates a more nuanced or regionally restricted role than in ALS spinal cord or mouse models. The findings imply that microglial activation is not a dominant or uniform feature in the cortical regions studied, and that technical limitations of snRNA-seq may understate the extent of microglial involvement.  
Potential therapeutic implications are limited, but the partial activation state may represent a targetable intermediate for modulating microglial function in ALS/FTLD.
</clinical>

---

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**  
Microglia in ALS and FTLD motor and prefrontal cortex exhibit a partial shift from homeostatic to activated states, marked by downregulation of CSF1R and CX3CR1 and upregulation of GNAS, IL18, and SPP1. However, a full disease-associated microglia (DAM) signature is not observed, and changes are less pronounced than in neurons or astrocytes. The magnitude of microglial activation does not differ substantially between sporadic and C9orf72+ cases or between brain regions. Technical limitations of snRNA-seq may under-detect microglial activation genes, suggesting these findings represent a lower bound on microglial involvement.

---

**Research Implications (≈150 words):**  
This study provides a nuanced view of microglial involvement in ALS and FTLD cortex, identifying a partial but not full transition to disease-associated states. The absence of a robust DAM or pro-inflammatory signature, in contrast to findings in ALS spinal cord or mouse models, raises questions about regional specificity and the technical sensitivity of snRNA-seq for microglial activation genes. The results align with some prior human cortical studies but diverge from the strong microglial activation seen in animal models and spinal cord, a point the authors attribute in part to nuclear profiling limitations (<contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>: "our data only partially reflect microglial changes, given that nuclear profiling has limited capability in detecting changes to microglial activation genes in tissue"). Open questions include whether more sensitive single-cell or spatial transcriptomic methods would reveal additional microglial heterogeneity or activation, and how microglial states interact with neuronal vulnerability in ALS/FTLD. Future work should integrate multi-omic and spatial approaches to resolve these issues and clarify the therapeutic potential of targeting microglial states in these diseases.

</methods>

<findings>
The principal finding of this study is that schizophrenia-associated transcriptomic alterations are highly cell type-specific and overwhelmingly concentrated in neuronal populations. Out of 4,766 differential expression events (2,994 unique genes across 16 of 20 cell populations), approximately 96% were localized to five neuronal cell types. These neuronal subtypes showed enrichment for genes associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder GWAS loci, as well as cluster-specific gene ontologies and canonical pathways.

In contrast, microglia—while identified as a distinct cell population—did not exhibit significant differential gene expression between schizophrenia and control samples. The study does not report the identification of multiple microglial subtypes or states (such as homeostatic, disease-associated, or inflammatory microglia) within the DLPFC. There is no mention of microglial subpopulation expansion, contraction, or unique marker gene signatures associated with schizophrenia. Furthermore, the authors do not describe any significant changes in microglial cell proportions or activation markers, nor do they report spatial or morphological validation of microglial states.

The authors do not discuss modulators such as age, sex, or genetic risk factors specifically in relation to microglia, nor do they report microglia-specific pathway enrichment, gene regulatory networks, or cell-cell communication findings. The study’s focus on neuronal subtypes is reinforced by the lack of microglial involvement in the major differentially expressed gene sets and pathways.

No temporal modelling, pseudotime analysis, or disease progression trajectories are reported for microglia. Similarly, there is no integration of genetic risk (e.g., eQTLs) or multi-omic data specifically linking microglial states to schizophrenia risk variants.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> The authors do not explicitly discuss any contradictions or departures from prior models regarding microglial involvement in schizophrenia.

</findings>

<clinical>
The study’s results indicate that microglia, at least in the adult DLPFC and as assessed by snRNA-seq, do not exhibit the disease-associated transcriptional changes seen in neuronal populations in schizophrenia. This suggests that microglial activation or dysfunction may not be a primary driver of molecular pathology in this brain region or disease stage, or that such changes are below the detection threshold of the current approach. <keyFinding priority='2'>Microglia are unlikely to serve as robust biomarkers or therapeutic targets for schizophrenia based on transcriptomic signatures in the DLPFC.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Research Implications**

The lack of significant microglial transcriptomic alterations in this large-scale snRNA-seq study of schizophrenia DLPFC raises important questions about the regional and temporal specificity of microglial involvement in psychiatric disorders. While animal models and some human studies have implicated microglial activation in schizophrenia, this dataset suggests that, at least in the adult DLPFC, microglia do not display distinct disease-associated states or marker gene changes. Future research should address whether microglial alterations are more prominent in other brain regions, developmental stages, or in response to environmental or genetic risk factors not captured in this cohort. Additionally, more sensitive approaches (e.g., spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, or functional assays) may be required to detect subtle or transient microglial changes. The findings also highlight the importance of cell type- and region-specific analyses in neuropsychiatric disease research. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> (as the authors do not explicitly discuss conflicts with prior microglial models, though the results may contrast with some expectations in the field).

# summary for Renthal 2018 (microglia)

1) **Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This study applied single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) with allele-specific SNP mapping to mosaic female mouse models and human Rett syndrome brain tissue, enabling direct comparison of wild-type and MECP2-mutant cells within the same individual. Microglia were identified as a distinct cluster but showed minimal MECP2-dependent transcriptional changes, with no evidence for disease-associated microglial subtypes or significant shifts in microglial gene expression. The major cell-autonomous effects of MECP2 loss were confined to neurons, while microglia remained largely transcriptionally stable regardless of genotype, age, or X-inactivation status. <keyFinding priority='3'>Microglia in Rett syndrome brains do not exhibit major disease-associated transcriptional states or subtype shifts.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

- Disease focus: Rett syndrome (MECP2 mutation, X-linked neurodevelopmental disorder)
</metadata>

<methods>
This study utilized single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on postmortem occipital cortex from three female Rett syndrome donors (all with the MECP2 R255X mutation) and single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) on visual cortex from mosaic female Mecp2+/– mice. A novel SNP-based approach was developed to assign each nucleus/cell as wild-type or mutant for MECP2, leveraging natural genetic variation and X-inactivation. Cell types were identified using Seurat clustering and canonical marker genes. The analysis focused on cell-type-specific gene expression changes, with particular attention to neurons, but all major brain cell types, including microglia, were profiled.
</methods>

<findings>
Microglia were robustly identified as a distinct cluster in both mouse and human datasets, using canonical markers such as *Cx3cr1* and *P2ry12*. However, the study found that microglia exhibited minimal MECP2-dependent transcriptional changes in both mosaic female mice and human Rett syndrome brains.

**Cell Type Proportions:**  
The proportion of microglia among total nuclei/cells was not significantly altered between wild-type and MECP2-mutant samples in either species. There was no evidence for expansion, depletion, or emergence of novel microglial subpopulations associated with MECP2 mutation, disease stage, or X-inactivation status. <keyFinding priority='3'>Microglial abundance and clustering were stable across genotypes and conditions.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression:**  
No significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were detected in microglia when comparing MECP2-mutant and wild-type transcriptotypes, either in the mouse model or in human Rett syndrome tissue. The authors explicitly state that the major transcriptional consequences of MECP2 loss were confined to neurons, with glial populations—including microglia—showing little to no MECP2-dependent gene expression changes. <keyFinding priority='3'>Microglia do not display a disease-associated transcriptional signature in Rett syndrome.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
The study did not report the identification of distinct microglial subtypes or states (e.g., homeostatic vs. disease-associated microglia) in either mouse or human Rett syndrome samples. Microglia were treated as a single, relatively homogeneous cluster, with no evidence for the emergence of DAM-like or inflammatory subpopulations. Marker gene expression (e.g., *Cx3cr1*, *P2ry12*) remained consistent across genotypes and conditions. <keyFinding priority='3'>No microglial subtypes or activation states were identified in Rett syndrome tissue.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Pathway Enrichment, Modulators & Metrics:**  
Because no significant DEGs were found in microglia, there were no enriched pathways, altered activation scores, or evidence for modulation by host factors (age, sex, X-inactivation skewing, or genetic background). The study did not report any microglial-specific regulatory networks, ligand-receptor interactions, or spatial/morphological changes validated by in situ methods.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
There was no evidence for microglial trajectory shifts, activation, or involvement in disease progression in Rett syndrome, as inferred from the cross-sectional snRNA-seq data. The authors did not observe any microglial state transitions associated with aging or disease stage.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
No microglial subpopulations were linked to Rett syndrome risk variants, eQTLs, or other multi-omic features. The study’s integrative analyses focused on neuronal populations.

**Contradictions/Departures:**  
The authors do not discuss any contradictions between their microglial findings and prior literature. They explicitly state that the lack of microglial involvement is a robust observation in their data. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

</findings>

<clinical>
The study concludes that microglia do not play a major cell-autonomous or non-cell-autonomous role in the transcriptional pathology of Rett syndrome, at least as detectable by snRNA-seq in postmortem human cortex and mouse models. The absence of disease-associated microglial states or activation signatures suggests that microglia are not primary drivers or responders in Rett syndrome pathogenesis, contrasting with their prominent roles in other neurodegenerative diseases.

3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

The findings from this study indicate that microglia remain transcriptionally stable in the context of MECP2 loss in both mouse models and human Rett syndrome brain tissue, with no evidence for disease-associated subtypes or activation states. This contrasts with the prominent microglial responses observed in other neurodegenerative and neuroinflammatory conditions, suggesting that Rett syndrome pathogenesis is primarily neuron-centric. Open questions remain regarding potential microglial functional changes not captured at the transcriptomic level, such as alterations in phagocytosis, synaptic pruning, or cytokine secretion, which may require proteomic or functional assays for detection. The study’s results align with prior bulk and single-cell transcriptomic analyses that have not identified robust microglial activation in Rett syndrome, and do not conflict with established microglial classification schemes. Future research may explore whether subtle or region-specific microglial changes occur in other brain areas or at different disease stages, but the current data strongly suggest that microglial transcriptional responses are not a hallmark of Rett syndrome. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD), behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP)
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) and ATAC-seq were performed on postmortem human brain tissue from 41 individuals (AD, bvFTD, PSP, controls), sampling three cortical regions (insula, primary motor cortex [BA4], primary visual cortex [V1]) with variable vulnerability to tau pathology. Over 590,000 high-quality nuclei (RNA) and 575,000 nuclei (ATAC) were analyzed. Cell type annotation, subclustering, and gene regulatory network inference were performed, with validation by immunohistochemistry and chromatin accessibility profiling.
</methods>

<quickReference>
This study identifies six major microglial states across AD, bvFTD, and PSP, including five that overlap with previously described human brain microglia. A key AD-specific microglial subtype (BA4_MIC-7), marked by ITM2B and enriched for AD GWAS risk genes (including SPI1), is validated by immunostaining and chromatin accessibility. Disease- and region-specific microglial states are modulated by genetic risk (e.g., APOE, SPI1), pathology burden, and transcriptional networks.
</quickReference>

<findings>
The authors systematically characterized microglial heterogeneity across three tauopathies and controls, identifying 18 microglial clusters grouped into six transcriptomically distinct states. Five of these states significantly overlapped with previously reported microglial clusters from fresh human brain and AD frontal cortex, supporting robust cross-study reproducibility <keyFinding priority='1'>. <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell Type Proportions:** 
Several microglial subclusters showed significant changes in abundance across disorders and regions. For example, INS_MIC-3 was enriched in all three diseases, while BA4_MIC-4 was positively correlated with tau pathology (cor = 0.57, p = 0.02), suggesting a link to dystrophic, senescent microglia <keyFinding priority='2'>. <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression & Pathway Enrichment:** 
- Shared disease-enriched microglial states (e.g., INS_MIC-3) upregulated WNT and PI3K pathway genes, while other states (e.g., INS_MIC-0, INS_MIC-1, INS_MIC-11) reflected loss-of-function signatures in PI3K, WNT, or V-type ATPase pathways.
- BA4_MIC-4 upregulated FLT and senescence-associated genes, consistent with a dystrophic phenotype.
- AD-specific microglia (BA4_MIC-7) upregulated ITM2B, amyloid processing, oxidative stress buffering, and chaperone-mediated autophagy genes. This cluster lacked expression of CD163, LRRK2, FOXP1, or SPP1, distinguishing it from previously described plaque-associated microglia <keyFinding priority='1'>. <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag> The authors note that BA4_MIC-7 shares some features with previously reported amyloid-plaque-associated microglia but is distinct in its marker profile and functional pathways.

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**
- **INS_MIC-3:** Disease-enriched across all tauopathies; upregulates WNT/PI3K genes; overlaps with MS brain microglia; interpreted as a generalized activated state.
- **BA4_MIC-4:** Correlates with tau pathology; upregulates FLT and senescence genes; likely represents dystrophic microglia.
- **BA4_MIC-7 (AD-specific):** Enriched in AD motor cortex; upregulates ITM2B, amyloid processing, and resilience-associated genes; validated by immunostaining (ITM2B more abundant in AD than bvFTD microglia); upregulated genes are significantly enriched for AD GWAS risk variants (MAGMA analysis) <keyFinding priority='1'>. <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **bvFTD-enriched microglia (BA4_MIC-1):** Upregulates ATP2C1, SORL1, and pro-inflammatory genes (NAIP, STK3, SERPINL1); most abundant in BA4 and INS in bvFTD.
- **Shared depleted microglial states:** Homeostatic microglia (INS_MIC-0) are depleted in disease; express canonical markers (CSF1R, P2RY12).

**Modulators & Metrics:**
- Microglial state proportions are modulated by regional tau pathology and genetic risk (e.g., AD GWAS enrichment in BA4_MIC-7).
- Transcriptional networks: AD-specific microglia are driven by SPI1, NR3C1, MXI1, and USF2, which together regulate ~60% of upregulated genes in BA4_MIC-7. SPI1 drives lysosomal/phagocytic genes (including IL15), while NR3C1 regulates amyloid processing genes (including ITM2B). Chromatin accessibility at SPI1 and NR3C1 binding sites is increased in AD microglia (validated by ATAC-seq footprinting) <keyFinding priority='1'>. <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- Disease- and region-specific microglial states are further modulated by local pathology burden (e.g., tau scores) and host genetics.

**Cell-Cell Communication:** 
- The study highlights upregulation of IL15 in AD microglia, a biomarker and potential mediator of neuroinflammation.

**Spatial Analysis:** 
- ITM2B protein is more abundant in AD than bvFTD microglia (immunohistochemistry), supporting transcriptomic findings.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:** 
- Microglial states such as BA4_MIC-7 are associated with resilience in regions with moderate pathology (motor cortex), suggesting a potential role in early or protective responses.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:** 
- AD GWAS risk variants are significantly enriched among upregulated genes in BA4_MIC-7, but not in other microglial clusters or downregulated genes.

<contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag> The authors explicitly note that the AD-specific microglial state (BA4_MIC-7) is distinct from previously described plaque-associated microglia, lacking certain markers (CD163, LRRK2, FOXP1, SPP1) and displaying a unique resilience-associated signature.
</findings>

<clinical>
Microglia in dementia display both shared and disease-specific states, with AD, bvFTD, and PSP each exhibiting unique microglial subtypes and gene regulatory networks. The AD-specific microglial state (BA4_MIC-7), marked by ITM2B and driven by SPI1/NR3C1, is strongly associated with genetic risk and may mediate amyloid processing, oxidative stress buffering, and resilience. These findings suggest that microglial subtypes may contribute to disease progression and regional vulnerability, and that targeting specific microglial states or their regulatory networks (e.g., SPI1, NR3C1, ITM2B) could have therapeutic potential. However, causal roles remain to be established, and most associations are based on cross-sectional data.
</clinical>

<researchImplications>
This study provides a comprehensive cross-disorder atlas of microglial heterogeneity in human tauopathies, revealing both conserved and disease-specific states. The identification of an AD-specific, genetically enriched microglial subtype (BA4_MIC-7) with a resilience-associated signature (ITM2B, SPI1, NR3C1) highlights potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers. The findings align with, but also extend, prior microglial classification schemes by demonstrating that microglial diversity is shaped by both genetic risk and regional pathology. Open questions include the causal role of these microglial states in disease progression, their temporal dynamics, and whether similar subtypes exist in other neurodegenerative conditions. The explicit distinction between BA4_MIC-7 and previously described plaque-associated microglia underscores the need for further functional validation and longitudinal studies. Integration with spatial transcriptomics and in vivo models will be critical to determine the mechanistic contributions of these microglial states to neurodegeneration and resilience.

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**

This large-scale snRNA-seq study of human prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia (n=48) found that microglia exhibit minimal transcriptional or proportional changes compared to neurons, with no novel microglial subtypes or disease-associated states identified. Microglial marker genes (e.g., CSF1R) were used for annotation, but microglia showed neither significant differential gene expression nor pathway enrichment in schizophrenia.

**Detailed Summary (≈800–1000 words):**

<methods>
The study employed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on postmortem human prefrontal cortex (Brodmann Area 10) from 24 schizophrenia and 24 control subjects, using MULTI-seq sample multiplexing to minimize batch effects. Over 500,000 nuclei were profiled, with rigorous quality control and doublet removal. Cell types were annotated using the ACTIONet framework, leveraging canonical marker genes for major brain cell types, including microglia (CSF1R). Differential expression and pathway analyses were performed using pseudo-bulk approaches, controlling for demographic and medication covariates. Validation of findings was performed for selected neuronal genes, but not for microglial markers.
</methods>

<findings>
Microglia were robustly identified as a distinct cell type in the prefrontal cortex using canonical markers (e.g., CSF1R). However, the study reports that microglia, along with other non-neuronal cell types, exhibited minimal transcriptional changes in schizophrenia compared to controls. Specifically, the following points summarize the microglial findings:

- **Cell Type Proportions:** There were no significant changes in the proportion of microglia between schizophrenia and control samples. The ACTIONet cell-cell similarity network confirmed that microglia formed a discrete, well-defined cluster, but its relative abundance was stable across disease states. <keyFinding priority='3'>Microglial abundance is unchanged in schizophrenia.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

- **Differential Gene Expression:** The study’s comprehensive differential expression analysis across 20 cell types/states found that the vast majority of schizophrenia-associated transcriptional perturbations occurred in neuronal populations. Microglia did not show significant up- or down-regulation of genes in schizophrenia. The total number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in microglia was negligible, and none reached the thresholds for significance after multiple testing correction. <keyFinding priority='3'>No significant microglial DEGs in schizophrenia.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

- **Pathway Enrichment:** Pathway analyses focused on neuronally relevant categories (synaptic organization, neurodevelopment, plasticity), with no reported enrichment for microglial or immune-related pathways in microglia. The study did not identify any microglial subtypes or activation states associated with disease, nor did it report enrichment for inflammatory, complement, or phagocytic pathways in microglia. <keyFinding priority='3'>No pathway enrichment or disease-associated microglial states detected.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

- **Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:** Microglia were treated as a single, canonical population, with no evidence for further subclustering or identification of disease-associated microglial states (e.g., DAM, PAM, or other activation signatures). The study’s archetypal analysis did not reveal any microglial subtypes beyond the homeostatic state. <keyFinding priority='3'>Microglia remain in a homeostatic state in schizophrenia cortex.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

- **Modulators & Metrics:** The study examined the influence of age, sex, postmortem interval, and medication exposure as covariates in all analyses. None of these factors were reported to modulate microglial gene expression or abundance in a disease-specific manner.

- **Gene Regulatory Networks & Cell-Cell Communication:** The study’s analysis of transcriptional regulators and cell-cell communication focused on neuronal populations. No microglia-specific transcription factors or ligand-receptor interactions were highlighted as altered in schizophrenia.

- **Spatial Analysis & Validation:** Morphological and spatial validation (RNAscope, immunostaining) was performed for selected neuronal genes, but not for microglial markers. No spatial or morphological changes in microglia were reported.

- **Aging/Disease Trajectories:** Temporal modeling and pseudotime analyses were applied to neuronal populations, with no evidence for microglial trajectory shifts or disease-stage transitions.

- **Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:** The integration of GWAS loci and eQTLs with cell-type-specific expression changes revealed strong enrichment in neurons, but not in microglia. Microglia did not emerge as a primary cell type mediating genetic risk for schizophrenia in this dataset.

Overall, the study’s explicit focus is on neuronal cell types, with microglia and other glia serving as reference populations. The absence of microglial changes is consistent across all major analytic axes, and the authors do not discuss any contradictions or departures from prior microglial literature, instead emphasizing the neuronal specificity of schizophrenia-associated transcriptional pathology.

The findings suggest that, in contrast to neurodegenerative disorders, microglial involvement in schizophrenia is limited or undetectable at the transcriptomic level in this brain region and cohort.

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words):**

The lack of detectable microglial transcriptional or proportional changes in this large, well-powered snRNA-seq study of schizophrenia suggests that microglia may not be primary mediators of disease pathology in the adult prefrontal cortex, at least at the level of steady-state gene expression. This finding aligns with the study’s broader conclusion that schizophrenia-associated molecular changes are highly neuron-specific. However, it leaves open questions regarding microglial function in other brain regions, at earlier disease stages, or in response to environmental stressors not captured in postmortem tissue. The absence of microglial subtypes or activation states contrasts with findings in neurodegenerative diseases, where microglial heterogeneity is prominent. The study does not explicitly discuss conflicts with prior microglial literature, but its results suggest that future research should focus on dynamic or functional microglial changes (e.g., proteomics, spatial transcriptomics, or in vivo imaging) and consider region- or stage-specific roles. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**  
In this large-scale snRNA-seq study of the human prefrontal cortex in schizophrenia, microglia were identified as a stable, transcriptionally homogeneous population with no significant changes in abundance, subtypes, or gene expression between cases and controls. Unlike neurons, microglia showed minimal differentially expressed genes and no enrichment for schizophrenia genetic risk, suggesting that microglial activation or dysfunction is not a prominent feature of schizophrenia in the adult PFC. These findings were consistent across two independent cohorts and were not modulated by age, sex, or genetic risk factors. <keyFinding priority='3'>Microglia show minimal disease-associated changes in schizophrenia.</keyFinding>

**Research Implications (≈150 words):**  
This study provides strong evidence that microglia in the adult human prefrontal cortex are largely unaffected at the transcriptomic level in schizophrenia, with no detectable disease-associated subtypes or activation states. This contrasts with findings in neurodegenerative disorders (e.g., Alzheimer’s disease), where microglial activation and heterogeneity are prominent. The lack of microglial involvement in schizophrenia pathophysiology, as assessed by snRNA-seq, suggests that future research should focus on neuronal and synaptic mechanisms. However, it remains possible that microglial changes could be present in other brain regions, developmental stages, or in response to environmental factors not captured in this study. The absence of microglial signatures also highlights the importance of cell type–resolved approaches for distinguishing disease mechanisms across neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative conditions. No conflicts with prior microglial classification schemes or models were explicitly discussed by the authors. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on postmortem human prefrontal cortex tissue from AD and age-matched non-symptomatic (NS) donors, all with APOE ε2/3 genotype. Astrocytes were enriched by FACS (LHX2+/NeuN–), but all major glial and neural cell types were captured. Pathology (amyloid, tau, GFAP) was quantified in the same tissue region as sequencing. Data were integrated with published AD snRNA-seq datasets for cross-study comparison.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and General Findings**  
Microglia were captured in the dataset but were not the primary focus of enrichment. The study does not report major findings or detailed subclustering for microglia, as the primary emphasis is on astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Microglia are present as a reference population for cell type identification and integration.

**Microglial Subtypes and Disease Associations**  
The paper does not provide a systematic breakdown of microglial subtypes, marker genes, or disease-associated states. In the main text, microglia are referenced in the context of cell type identification (e.g., expressing C1QA, C1QB, C1QC, TYROBP, P2RY12, HEXB, TREM2, CTSS) and as a comparator for astrocyte and oligodendrocyte analyses. There is no evidence of microglial subclustering, nor are microglial activation states (e.g., homeostatic, DAM, or other disease-associated microglia) described or quantified.

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**  
No microglia-specific differential gene expression or pathway enrichment analyses are reported. The study does not discuss changes in microglial proportions, gene expression, or functional states between AD and NS donors.

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**  
No spatial, morphological, or immunohistochemical validation is presented for microglia. The focus of spatial transcriptomics and immunostaining is on astrocyte subtypes and their localization.

**Integration with Other Datasets**  
Microglia are included in the integrated datasets for cell type annotation and clustering, but the study does not analyze microglial heterogeneity or disease associations in detail. There is no discussion of microglial subtypes across datasets or their relationship to AD pathology.

**Host or Genetic Modulators**  
No analysis of host factors (age, sex, APOE, GWAS variants) on microglial states is provided.

**Contradictions or Departures**  
The authors do not discuss any findings regarding microglia that contradict or depart from previous literature. The lack of microglial focus is acknowledged by omission rather than explicit discussion.

**Detailed Summary**

Sadick et al. (2022) present a single-nucleus RNA-seq study of human prefrontal cortex in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and age-matched non-symptomatic (NS) controls, focusing on astrocyte and oligodendrocyte heterogeneity. Microglia are captured in the dataset and identified using canonical marker genes (C1QA, C1QB, C1QC, TYROBP, P2RY12, HEXB, TREM2, CTSS), but the study does not pursue further analysis of microglial subtypes, activation states, or disease associations.

The methodology includes FACS enrichment for astrocytes (LHX2+/NeuN–), but all major CNS cell types, including microglia, are present in the dataset. Microglia are used as a reference for cell type annotation and for integration with other published AD snRNA-seq datasets. However, the results and discussion sections do not provide a breakdown of microglial subtypes, nor do they report differential gene expression, pathway enrichment, or changes in microglial proportions between AD and NS donors.

No spatial transcriptomics or immunohistochemical validation is performed for microglia. The spatial and morphological analyses are focused exclusively on astrocyte subtypes. Similarly, the integration of multiple datasets is used to resolve astrocyte and oligodendrocyte subpopulations, with no mention of microglial heterogeneity or disease-associated states.

There is no analysis of host or genetic factors (such as APOE genotype) on microglial states, nor is there discussion of microglial involvement in AD pathology. The absence of microglial findings is not discussed as a contradiction or limitation, but rather reflects the study’s explicit focus on astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.

<keyFinding priority='3'>
Microglia are present in the dataset and identified by canonical markers, but the study does not analyze microglial subtypes, activation states, or disease associations in Alzheimer’s disease.
</keyFinding>
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

---

**Research Implications**

This study does not advance knowledge of microglial heterogeneity or function in Alzheimer’s disease. The lack of microglial analysis is a consequence of the study’s design, which prioritizes astrocyte and oligodendrocyte enrichment and characterization. As such, the paper does not address open questions regarding microglial subtypes (e.g., DAM, homeostatic, or other states), their marker genes, or their relationship to AD pathology. The findings neither support nor contradict existing microglial classification schemes, as microglia are not analyzed in detail. Future studies with microglia-focused enrichment and subclustering will be required to address these gaps.

Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD), with emphasis on the TREM2 R47H risk variant.
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on mid-frontal cortex tissue from 46 AD patients (22 with common variant [CV] TREM2, 24 with R47H-TREM2). Mouse models included CRISPR knock-in of human TREM2 (CV or R47H) at the mouse Trem2 locus, crossed to P301S tauopathy mice. Single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) and bulk RNA-seq were used for mouse microglia. Validation included immunostaining, RNAscope, Western blotting, and behavioral assays.
</methods>

<Quick Reference>
The R47H-TREM2 variant in AD expands a unique microglial subpopulation (MG4) with enhanced proinflammatory and AKT signaling signatures, reminiscent of disease-associated microglia (DAM). This MG4 state is more prevalent in R47H carriers and is driven by TREM2 signaling, with sex-specific effects and strong upregulation in females. Pharmacological AKT inhibition reverses these inflammatory signatures and rescues synaptic loss, highlighting AKT as a key modulator of R47H microglial states.
</Quick Reference>

<Detailed Summary>

**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Identification**

snRNA-seq of human AD frontal cortex revealed seven microglial subclusters (MG1–MG7). The MG4 subcluster was significantly enriched in R47H-TREM2 carriers compared to CV-TREM2 (P = 0.048), while other subclusters showed no genotype-specific differences. MG4 was the only microglial state robustly associated with the R47H variant, and this enrichment was not sex-specific in humans, though sex differences were prominent in downstream analyses and mouse models. <keyFinding priority='1'>MG4 represents a disease-associated microglial state selectively expanded in R47H-TREM2 AD brains.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Defining Marker Genes and Functional Signature**

MG4 microglia were characterized by upregulation of DAM-associated genes, including LPL, CD83, SPP1, and MYO1E, and downregulation of homeostatic markers such as P2RY12 and CX3CR1. Pathway analysis revealed strong enrichment for TNFα signaling via NF-κB, IL2-STAT5, and inflammatory response pathways. Upstream regulator analysis predicted activation of TREM2 signaling intermediates (AKT, NF-κB, CSF1/2). <keyFinding priority='1'>MG4 microglia display a proinflammatory, DAM-like transcriptomic profile with hyperactivation of AKT and NF-κB pathways.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Sex-Specific and Disease-Associated Changes**

Differential expression analysis showed that R47H-TREM2 induced more DEGs in male than female microglia, but the nature of the changes was sex-specific: females upregulated immune activation pathways (e.g., TLR2 up, CX3CR1 down), while males showed upregulation of metabolic and ATP pathways (e.g., SPP1 up, MALAT1 down). In mouse models, the R47H mutation exacerbated tauopathy-induced spatial memory deficits and inflammatory gene expression specifically in females, with no effect on tau pathology load or general microglial functions (phagocytosis, injury response). <keyFinding priority='2'>R47H-TREM2 effects on microglial activation and cognitive deficits are sex-dependent, with pronounced disease enhancement in females.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Disease-Associated Microglial States in Mouse Models**

In P301S tauopathy mice, scRNA-seq identified two main microglial clusters: cluster 1 (homeostatic) and cluster 2 (DAM-like). R47H-hTREM2 increased the proportion of cluster 2 microglia in tauopathy, with upregulation of DAM genes (Clec7a, Ctsb, Axl, Apoe, Cd63, Cst7) and interferon response genes (Irf7, Ifih1, Ifitm3, Mx1, Ifi44, Ifit3). RNAscope confirmed increased Apoe+ microglia in R47H-hTREM2 tauopathy mice. <keyFinding priority='1'>R47H-hTREM2 enhances a DAM-like, proinflammatory microglial state in response to tau pathology, with strong overlap to human MG4.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**AKT Signaling as a Central Modulator**

Both human and mouse R47H microglia showed predicted and biochemically validated hyperactivation of AKT signaling (increased phospho-AKT). In vitro, AKT inhibition (MK-2206) reversed a substantial portion of R47H-induced proinflammatory gene expression and cytokine secretion in microglia exposed to tau fibrils. In vivo, chronic AKT inhibition abolished the tauopathy-induced MG4 subcluster and rescued synaptic loss in R47H-hTREM2 tauopathy mice. <keyFinding priority='1'>AKT hyperactivation is necessary for the maintenance of the R47H-associated proinflammatory microglial state and its disease-enhancing effects.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Homeostatic Microglia**

MG1 was identified as the homeostatic microglial cluster, enriched in nontransgenic and wild-type mice, and reduced in R47H-hTREM2 tauopathy mice. MG1 expressed high levels of P2RY12 and other canonical homeostatic markers.

**Temporal and Spatial Validation**

RNAscope and immunostaining validated increased Apoe+ microglia in R47H-hTREM2 tauopathy mice. Behavioral assays (Morris water maze) demonstrated exacerbated spatial memory deficits in female R47H-hTREM2 tauopathy mice, independent of tau pathology load.

**Gene Regulatory Networks and Cell-Cell Communication**

Upstream regulator analysis implicated TREM2, CSF1/2, TNF, NF-κB, and AKT as key drivers of the R47H microglial state. No specific ligand-receptor cross-talk was highlighted beyond these canonical pathways.

**Genetic and Demographic Modulators**

The R47H-TREM2 variant is the primary genetic driver of the MG4 state. Sex was a strong modulator of microglial response and disease phenotype, with females showing greater vulnerability to R47H-induced inflammatory activation and cognitive deficits.

**Contradictions and Context**

The authors note that heterozygous R47H does not phenocopy complete TREM2 deficiency, which blocks DAM induction. Instead, R47H enhances DAM-like states and inflammation, particularly in females. This is contrasted with prior mouse studies using homozygous R47H or TREM2 knockout, which show different effects on amyloid and tau pathology. <contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag> (Explicitly discussed: R47H heterozygosity enhances, rather than blocks, DAM-like activation, in contrast to TREM2 knockout.)

</Detailed Summary>

<clinical>
The R47H-TREM2 variant drives a unique, disease-enhancing microglial state (MG4/DAM-like) with heightened proinflammatory and AKT signaling signatures in AD. This state is associated with worsened cognitive deficits and synaptic loss in tauopathy, especially in females, and is not due to increased tau pathology per se. Pharmacological inhibition of AKT reverses these microglial changes and rescues synaptic integrity, suggesting that AKT is a promising therapeutic target for modulating microglial responses in R47H-TREM2 AD. The findings highlight the importance of genetic and sex-specific factors in microglial-mediated neurodegeneration and suggest that microglial subtypes may serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets in AD, particularly in genetically at-risk populations.
</clinical>

<Research Implications>
This study establishes that the R47H-TREM2 variant selectively expands a DAM-like, proinflammatory microglial subpopulation (MG4) in human AD and mouse tauopathy, driven by AKT hyperactivation. The MG4 state shares features with previously described DAM/MGnD microglia but is uniquely enhanced by R47H and modulated by sex. These findings align with, but also extend, prior models by showing that R47H does not block but rather exaggerates DAM-like activation, in contrast to TREM2 knockout. Open questions include the precise mechanisms by which AKT signaling sustains the MG4 state, the role of APOE genotype, and the relevance of these findings to other AD risk alleles. Future work should address the isoform-specific roles of AKT, the impact of human APOE isoforms, and the potential for AKT-targeted therapies in genetically defined AD subgroups. The study’s integration of human and mouse data strengthens confidence in the translational relevance of the MG4 microglial state as a disease driver and therapeutic target.

# summary for Schirmer 2019 (microglia)

1) **Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This study (Schirmer et al., 2019, Nature) used single-nucleus RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics to dissect microglial heterogeneity in multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions. Microglia in MS white matter lesions exhibited a marked expansion of activated and phagocytosing subtypes, characterized by upregulation of CD68, CD74, FTL, MSR1, and lipid degradation genes (ASAH1, ACSL1, DPYD), with loss of homeostatic markers (P2RY12, SYNDIG1, KCNQ3). A distinct phagocytosing microglia/macrophage population was identified by the presence of oligodendrocyte/myelin transcripts (PLP1, MBP, ST18), validated by in vitro myelin uptake assays. These activated states were spatially enriched at chronic active lesion rims and modulated by lesion stage and demyelination.

<methods>
This study employed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on frozen postmortem human brain tissue from 12 MS and 9 control samples, sampling both cortical grey matter and adjacent subcortical white matter lesions at various stages of demyelination. Nuclei were isolated by sucrose-gradient ultracentrifugation and processed using the 10x Genomics platform. Spatial transcriptomic validation was performed using multiplex in situ hybridization (smFISH) and immunohistochemistry. Functional validation of microglial phagocytosis was conducted using human and mouse microglia exposed to purified myelin in vitro.

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and General Activation**  
Microglia were markedly expanded in MS white matter lesions compared to controls, particularly at the rim of chronic active lesions.

**Microglial Subtypes and Marker Genes**  
The study identified several microglial subpopulations:

- **Homeostatic Microglia**: Present in both control and MS tissue, expressing P2RY12, RUNX1, and CSF1R. These cells were depleted in active MS lesions.
- **Activated Microglia**: MS-specific clusters upregulated activation and phagocytosis markers including CD68, CD74, FTL (ferritin light chain), MSR1 (macrophage scavenger receptor 1), and SPP1. These cells also showed increased expression of genes involved in lipid degradation and myelin breakdown (ASAH1, ACSL1, DPYD). <keyFinding priority='1'>Activated microglia at lesion rims upregulated iron-handling and lipid catabolism genes, consistent with ongoing myelin phagocytosis and iron accumulation.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **Phagocytosing Microglia/Macrophages**: A distinct cluster was defined by the presence of oligodendrocyte/myelin transcripts (PLP1, MBP, ST18), suggesting engulfment of myelin debris. This was functionally validated by in vitro assays showing that microglia ingest myelin-derived mRNAs, which localize to perinuclear and nuclear compartments for several days post-phagocytosis. <keyFinding priority='1'>Phagocytosing microglia/macrophages in MS lesions can be identified by the presence of myelin/oligodendrocyte transcripts, reflecting active myelin debris clearance.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**  
Activated microglia in MS lesions showed upregulation of:

- **Phagocytosis and Lysosomal Genes**: CD68, CD74, MSR1, SPP1.
- **Iron Metabolism**: FTL, FTH1.
- **Lipid Degradation**: ASAH1, ACSL1, DPYD.
- **Antigen Presentation**: MHC class II genes (CD74).
- **Loss of Homeostatic/Neuroprotective Markers**: Downregulation of P2RY12, SYNDIG1 (synapse remodeling), KCNQ3 (potassium channel).

These changes were most pronounced at the rim of chronic active lesions, as confirmed by spatial transcriptomics and immunohistochemistry. <keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial activation signatures were spatially mapped to lesion rims, with homeostatic microglia largely absent from these regions.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Functional and Spatial Validation**  
- **In situ hybridization** confirmed the spatial localization of activated microglia (CD68+, FTL+, MSR1+) at lesion rims.
- **In vitro myelin uptake assays** demonstrated that both human and mouse microglia ingest myelin-derived mRNAs (Mbp, Plp1), which persist intracellularly and are detectable by smFISH for several days. Phagocytosing microglia upregulated Cd163 and downregulated P2ry12, mirroring the in vivo MS lesion signature. <keyFinding priority='2'>Functional validation supports the transcriptomic identification of phagocytosing microglia by myelin mRNA content.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators and Metrics**  
- **Lesion Stage and Demyelination**: The abundance and activation state of microglia were strongly associated with lesion stage (acute, chronic active, chronic inactive) and the degree of demyelination, with the most pronounced activation at chronic active rims.
- **Iron Accumulation**: Upregulation of ferritin genes (FTL, FTH1) in microglia at lesion rims is consistent with iron overload, a known feature of chronic MS lesions.

**Gene Regulatory Networks and Cell-Cell Communication**  
- The study did not report specific transcription factor regulatory networks for microglia, but highlighted the upregulation of genes involved in antigen presentation and phagocytosis.
- No explicit ligand-receptor or cell-cell communication analyses were presented for microglia.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**  
- Microglial activation and phagocytosis signatures were linked to lesion progression, with spatial and temporal association to chronic active lesion rims and demyelination.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**  
- The study did not directly integrate genetic risk variants or eQTLs with microglial subtypes.

</findings>

<clinical>
Microglia in MS lesions, particularly at chronic active rims, adopt a highly activated, phagocytic, and iron-handling phenotype, likely contributing to ongoing demyelination and neurodegeneration. The presence of myelin/oligodendrocyte transcripts in microglia provides a molecular signature of active phagocytosis and may serve as a biomarker for lesion activity. These findings suggest that microglial activation and phagocytosis are central to MS lesion progression and may represent therapeutic targets, though causality cannot be established from cross-sectional data. <keyFinding priority='1'>Activated and phagocytosing microglia may perpetuate inflammation and tissue injury in progressive MS, especially at lesion rims.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study provides a detailed molecular atlas of microglial heterogeneity in human MS lesions, highlighting the spatial and functional diversity of microglial responses. The identification of phagocytosing microglia/macrophages by the presence of myelin-derived transcripts is a novel approach, validated both in situ and in vitro, and may be applicable to other demyelinating or neurodegenerative conditions. The spatial restriction of activated microglia to lesion rims underscores the importance of microenvironmental cues in shaping microglial states. Open questions remain regarding the functional consequences of prolonged microglial activation and iron accumulation—whether these states are neurotoxic, reparative, or context-dependent. The study does not directly address genetic or environmental modulators of microglial phenotypes, nor does it resolve whether similar subtypes exist in early MS or in response to therapy. The findings are largely consistent with prior models of microglial activation in MS, but the explicit demonstration of myelin mRNA uptake as a marker of phagocytosis is a significant advance. Future work should address the temporal dynamics, reversibility, and therapeutic modulation of these microglial states in MS and related disorders. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

<keyFinding priority='3'>
The single-nucleus RNA-seq study by Serrano-Pozo et al. (2024) provides a comprehensive atlas of astrocyte transcriptomic changes across five brain regions and four stages of Alzheimer’s disease neuropathology. The methodology involved enrichment for astrocyte nuclei by depleting neurons and oligodendrocytes, but microglia were not specifically targeted for enrichment or downstream analysis. In the initial cell type identification, microglia were recognized as a minor population based on canonical marker gene expression (e.g., P2RY12, CD74), but the study does not proceed to analyze microglia in detail.

The main focus of the paper is the identification and characterization of astrocyte subclusters, their spatial and temporal dynamics, and their association with AD pathology. All major findings, including the definition of homeostatic, intermediate, and reactive astrocyte states, as well as the modeling of astrocyte trajectories and exhaustion, are restricted to astrocytes. No microglial subtypes (such as disease-associated microglia [DAM], proliferative-region associated microglia [PAM], or other states) are defined, nor are microglial marker genes or functional pathways discussed in the context of AD progression.

The study does not report any quantitative changes in microglial proportions across brain regions or pathology stages. There is no analysis of microglial gene expression changes, pathway enrichment, or regulatory networks. No spatial or morphological validation of microglial states is performed, and no cell-cell communication analyses involving microglia are presented.

Furthermore, the paper does not discuss microglial responses in relation to host or genetic factors (such as APOE genotype, age, or sex), nor does it integrate microglial data with genetic or multi-omic risk factors. All discussion of disease mechanisms, therapeutic implications, and biomarker potential is centered on astrocyte biology.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

In summary, while microglia are present in the dataset and identified in initial cell type plots, the study does not provide any substantive findings regarding microglial heterogeneity, disease association, or functional roles in AD. The absence of microglial analysis is consistent throughout the paper, and no contradictions or departures from prior microglial literature are discussed.

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words):**  
This study does not advance the understanding of microglial heterogeneity or function in Alzheimer’s disease. The lack of microglial subclustering, marker gene analysis, or disease association highlights a gap that remains to be addressed in future work. Given the central role of microglia in AD pathogenesis, as established in other single-cell studies, the absence of microglial analysis in this large, multi-region dataset represents a missed opportunity. Future studies could leverage the existing data to perform dedicated microglial subclustering and trajectory modeling, potentially revealing region- and stage-specific microglial states. The findings here neither support nor contradict established microglial classification schemes, as microglia are not analyzed beyond initial identification. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Summary:**  
This paper provides no significant findings on microglia; all major analyses and conclusions are restricted to astrocytes. Microglia are present in the dataset but not characterized or discussed in relation to Alzheimer’s disease progression.

<methods>
This study performed parallel single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) and single-nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq) on temporal cortex tissue from 12 PD and 12 control donors. Over 200,000 nuclei were profiled, with cell type and subtype annotation validated by reference mapping and marker gene expression. Differential expression and chromatin accessibility analyses were performed using NEBULA, with integration of GWAS, cCRE, and TF motif data. No significant changes in microglial proportions were observed between PD and controls.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and General Features**
Microglia were identified as one of six major cell types, further subdivided into three clusters: Micro1, Micro2, and Micro3. The majority of microglial nuclei belonged to Micro1. No significant differences in overall microglial abundance or in the proportions of microglial subtypes were detected between PD and control samples (<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>).

**Microglial Subtypes and Disease Associations**
- **Micro1**: This was the dominant microglial subtype. It exhibited the highest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among all cell subtypes in the dataset (n=5640), with a strong polarization toward downregulation in PD (<keyFinding priority='1'>). Key downregulated genes included those involved in immune response, DNA damage response, chromatin organization, and cellular recycling. Pathway analysis revealed suppression of microglia-specific immune pathways and stress-responsive functions, including DNA repair and apoptosis regulation (<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>). Micro1 also showed the strongest enrichment for downregulated PD GWAS-DEGs among all clusters, suggesting a prominent role in disease-associated gene suppression (<keyFinding priority='1'>). Notably, the familial PD gene PRKN was differentially expressed in microglia, and LRRK2 was a DEG in microglia and OPCs.
- **Micro2**: This cluster also showed enrichment for downregulated pathways, but with fewer DEGs than Micro1. The directionality of gene expression changes was consistent with Micro1, supporting a general suppression of microglial immune and stress response functions in PD (<keyFinding priority='2'>).
- **Micro3**: This minor cluster contained a small proportion of microglial nuclei and was less well characterized due to low abundance. It was noted to contain some DEGs, including familial PD genes such as DJ-1 (PARK7) and PINK1, but the biological significance was not deeply explored (<confidenceLevel>low</confidenceLevel>).

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathways**
- Microglial DEGs in PD were predominantly downregulated and enriched for pathways related to DNA damage response, chromatin organization, apoptosis regulation, and immune signaling (e.g., interferon, cytokine, and complement pathways). This suggests a suppression of canonical microglial activation and stress response programs in the temporal cortex during PD progression (<keyFinding priority='1'>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>).
- Downregulated PD GWAS-DEGs in microglia were enriched for diverse categories including DNA metabolism, immune response, mitochondrial organization, and vesicle transport. This pattern was most prominent in Micro1 and OPC1 clusters.

**Chromatin Accessibility and Regulatory Mechanisms**
- Microglial clusters showed a predominance of differentially accessible peaks (DAPs) with increased accessibility in PD, but relatively few DAPs overlapped with DEGs of matching directionality, suggesting that open chromatin sites may often affect distal rather than proximal genes (<keyFinding priority='2'>, <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>).
- Integration of snATAC-seq and snRNA-seq identified cis-coaccessibility networks (CCANs) and candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) linked to microglial DEGs, including those within PD GWAS loci.
- Motif enrichment analysis revealed that downregulated PD GWAS-DEGs in Micro1 were predicted to be regulated by large networks of differentially expressed transcription factors (TF-DEGs), with YY1, SP3, and KLF16 highlighted as potential master regulators (<keyFinding priority='2'>, <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>).

**Genetic Modulators and Variant Effects**
- Several regulatory variants in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) with PD GWAS SNPs were identified within cCREs of microglial PD GWAS-DEGs, predicted to alter TF binding affinities (e.g., for YY1, SP3, KLF16, and others). These findings suggest that non-coding genetic variation may contribute to microglial gene dysregulation in PD (<keyFinding priority='1'>, <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>).

**Morphological/Spatial Validation**
- No direct morphological or spatial validation of microglial subtypes was reported.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**
- The study focused on temporal cortex samples with minimal to mild pathology, suggesting that observed microglial gene expression changes may represent early or pre-neurodegenerative stages of PD progression in this region.

<clinical>
Microglia in the temporal cortex of PD patients exhibit a pronounced suppression of immune response, DNA repair, and stress-response pathways, particularly within the dominant Micro1 subtype. This downregulation is strongly associated with PD GWAS loci and may reflect an impaired ability of microglia to respond to cellular stress or maintain genomic integrity during disease progression. The identification of regulatory variants and TF networks (notably involving YY1, SP3, and KLF16) suggests that microglial dysfunction in PD may be driven by both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. While these findings are associative, they implicate microglial gene regulatory networks as potential contributors to PD pathogenesis and highlight candidate targets for therapeutic intervention or biomarker development. However, the absence of overt microglial activation or proliferation in this cortical region suggests that microglial dysfunction may precede or differ from classical neuroinflammatory responses observed in other brain regions or later disease stages.

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**
Microglia in the temporal cortex of Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients, especially the dominant Micro1 subtype, show extensive downregulation of genes involved in immune response, DNA repair, and stress pathways, with strong enrichment for PD GWAS loci. This suppression is linked to regulatory networks involving TFs such as YY1, SP3, and KLF16, and is modulated by non-coding variants in high LD with PD risk alleles. No significant changes in microglial abundance or proliferation were observed, suggesting early or pre-neurodegenerative dysfunction rather than classical activation.

---

**Research Implications (≈150 words):**
This study provides a detailed multi-omic map of microglial gene regulatory changes in the temporal cortex during PD, revealing a unique pattern of suppressed immune and stress-response pathways rather than overt activation. The strong association with PD GWAS loci and regulatory variants suggests that microglial dysfunction may be genetically programmed and could act as an early driver or permissive factor in cortical PD progression. The identification of master TFs (YY1, SP3, KLF16) and their regulatory networks offers new avenues for mechanistic studies and potential therapeutic targeting. Notably, the observed microglial states differ from the pro-inflammatory or disease-associated microglia (DAM) described in Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative models, indicating disease- and region-specific microglial responses. Future work should address whether these suppressed microglial programs are reversible, their impact on neuronal vulnerability, and how they interact with other glial and neuronal subtypes during PD progression. No explicit contradictions with prior microglial classification schemes were discussed by the authors.

# summary for Smajic 2021 (microglia)

**Quick Reference**

This study (Smajić et al., 2022, *Brain*) used single-nucleus RNA sequencing of human midbrain to reveal that microglia are significantly increased in idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (IPD), particularly in the substantia nigra, and display a shift toward activated, amoeboid states. Disease-associated microglial subpopulations are marked by upregulation of IL1B, GPNMB, and HSP90AA1, and are enriched for Parkinson’s disease genetic risk variants, especially those involving LRRK2. These findings are most pronounced in older individuals with IPD and are validated by immunofluorescence and morphological analysis.

- Disease focus: Idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (IPD)
</metadata>

<methods>
- Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on post-mortem ventral midbrain tissue (including substantia nigra) from 6 IPD patients and 5 age-/sex-matched controls.
- >41,000 nuclei were profiled; cell type proportions and transcriptional states were validated by immunofluorescence (IBA1 for microglia), automated image analysis, and spatial/morphological quantification.
- Genetic risk enrichment was assessed using MAGMA with GWAS summary statistics.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Morphology**
The study found a significant increase in the proportion of microglia in IPD midbrain compared to controls (t-test P = 0.03), with the most pronounced increase in the substantia nigra (SN) as validated by IBA1 immunofluorescence and automated image analysis. Morphologically, microglia in IPD SN were less ramified and more amoeboid, indicating an activated state (t-test P = 2 × 10⁻¹⁶ for reduced branching) <keyFinding priority='1'></keyFinding><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>.

**Microglial Subtype Identification and Characterization**
Unsupervised clustering of ~3900 microglial nuclei identified seven subpopulations, with three major subtypes:
- **P2RY12^high**: Expressing high levels of P2RY12, representing homeostatic/resting microglia.
- **GPNMB^high**: Marked by upregulation of GPNMB, associated with microglial activation and cytokine secretion.
- **HSP90AA1^high/IL1B^high**: Characterized by high HSP90AA1 and IL1B, linked to stress response and pro-inflammatory signaling.

Trajectory analysis revealed a continuum from P2RY12^high (resting) to GPNMB^high and HSP90AA1^high/IL1B^high (activated) states. IPD microglia were enriched at the activated ends of these trajectories, indicating a disease-associated shift toward pro-inflammatory and stress-responsive phenotypes <keyFinding priority='1'></keyFinding><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>.

**Defining Marker Genes and Functional Signatures**
- **P2RY12^high**: P2RY12 (down in activation), homeostatic signature.
- **GPNMB^high**: GPNMB (up), associated with positive regulation of cytokine secretion and collagen biosynthesis.
- **HSP90AA1^high/IL1B^high**: HSP90AA1, IL1B (both up), enriched for unfolded protein response and cytokine-mediated signaling pathways.

A set of 29 genes was identified as both upregulated in IPD microglia and associated with the activation trajectory, including GPNMB, IL1B, HSP90AA1, CD163, and others involved in cytokine signaling and stress response <keyFinding priority='1'></keyFinding><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>.

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**
Immunofluorescence for IBA1 confirmed increased microglial area in IPD, especially in SN. Morphological analysis showed a significant reduction in microglial branching (ramification) in IPD SN, consistent with an activated, amoeboid phenotype.

**Genetic and Host Modulators**
MAGMA analysis revealed significant enrichment of Parkinson’s disease GWAS risk variants in microglia-specific genes, particularly in IPD samples. LRRK2 was the top genetically enriched marker for microglia, supporting a genetic contribution to microglial activation in IPD <keyFinding priority='1'></keyFinding><confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel><contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>.

**Pathway Enrichment**
Activated microglial subtypes in IPD were enriched for pathways related to cytokine secretion, unfolded protein response, and NLRP3 inflammasome signaling. These findings suggest a central role for inflammatory and stress-response pathways in disease-associated microglial states.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**
Pseudotime analysis indicated that microglia in IPD are shifted along an activation trajectory toward pro-inflammatory and stress-responsive states, with a loss of homeostatic P2RY12^high microglia and expansion of GPNMB^high and HSP90AA1^high/IL1B^high subtypes.

**Cell-Cell Communication**
While not the main focus, the upregulation of cytokine signaling genes in microglia suggests increased potential for cross-talk with astrocytes and other glia, consistent with a pan-glial activation model.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> for all major microglial findings; the authors do not report explicit conflicts with prior microglial models, but note that their findings extend previous bulk and animal studies by providing cell-type and disease-specific resolution.

</findings>

<clinical>
Microglial activation emerges as a central mechanism in IPD midbrain pathology. The expansion of pro-inflammatory and stress-responsive microglial subtypes, particularly those marked by GPNMB, IL1B, and HSP90AA1, may contribute to neuroinflammation and neuronal vulnerability in Parkinson’s disease. The enrichment of genetic risk variants (notably LRRK2) in these microglial states underscores their potential as therapeutic targets or biomarkers. However, causality remains associative due to the cross-sectional nature of the study. The findings support further investigation into immunomodulatory strategies for Parkinson’s disease.
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications**

This study provides strong evidence that microglial heterogeneity and activation are integral to IPD midbrain pathology, with clear expansion of disease-associated subtypes (GPNMB^high, HSP90AA1^high/IL1B^high) and loss of homeostatic microglia. The marker genes and subtypes identified align with, but extend, previous models of microglial activation in neurodegeneration, offering a more granular, human-specific atlas. The explicit genetic enrichment (LRRK2, etc.) in microglia supports a causal link between risk variants and glial activation.

Open questions include:
- The temporal sequence of microglial activation relative to neuronal loss.
- The functional consequences of GPNMB^high and HSP90AA1^high microglial states in vivo.
- Whether these microglial subtypes are reversible or targetable in early disease.
- The interplay between microglia and other glia (astrocytes, oligodendrocytes) in propagating neuroinflammation.

No explicit contradictions with prior models are discussed; rather, the study fills a gap by providing cell-type-specific and disease-contextualized data in human tissue. Future work should validate these findings in larger cohorts and explore the mechanistic roles of identified microglial subtypes in disease progression and therapy response.

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on post-mortem human entorhinal and somatosensory cortex from 6 AD and 6 non-diseased control (NDC) brains, with selective enrichment for microglia and astrocyte nuclei via FACS-based negative selection (removal of NeuN+ and Sox10+ nuclei). Quantitative immunohistochemistry for amyloid-β and pTau was performed on adjacent tissue. Data were integrated across regions and samples, and major findings were validated by re-analysis of four published human AD snRNA-seq datasets. Morphological validation included immunostaining for GPNMB.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Identification**
The study profiled 27,592 microglial nuclei, identifying three main microglial subclusters (Micro1, Micro2, Micro3) and a perivascular macrophage (PVM) cluster (see Fig. 1b,e). Micro1 was enriched for homeostatic microglial markers, Micro2 for activation/inflammatory genes, and Micro3 for a lower expression of both homeostatic and activation genes, with higher C3 and LPAR6. PVMs expressed CD163, MRC1, and MSR1.

**Microglial Subtype Characterization**
- **Micro1 (Homeostatic):** Expressed high levels of canonical microglial genes (e.g., P2RY12, TMEM119, CX3CR1, CSF1R). This cluster was relatively depleted in AD, especially with increasing amyloid-β and pTau pathology.
- **Micro2 (Activation/Inflammatory):** Enriched for genes involved in the TYROBP causal network, complement (C1QA, C1QB, C1QC), and ferroptosis pathways. Showed increased representation with higher amyloid-β and pTau burden. This cluster was also enriched for DAM (disease-associated microglia), ARM (activated response microglia), and IRM (interferon response microglia) gene sets, though these signatures were not exclusive to Micro2. <keyFinding priority='1'>Micro2 is the principal disease-associated microglial state, showing upregulation of AD risk genes (APOE, MS4A6A, PILRA), phagocytosis, autophagy, and inflammatory pathways in association with pathology.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **Micro3 (Dystrophic/Low-activity):** Characterized by low expression of both homeostatic and activation genes, but higher C3 and LPAR6. This may correspond to dystrophic or immunosenescent microglia. <keyFinding priority='2'>Micro3 may represent a less active or dystrophic state, but its disease association is less pronounced.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **Perivascular Macrophages (PVM):** Expressed CD163, MRC1, MSR1, and showed upregulation of autophagy and chaperone pathways with pTau pathology. PVMs also increased in proportion with pathology. <keyFinding priority='2'>PVMs are transcriptionally responsive to pTau, with upregulation of proteostasis and autophagy genes.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**
- **Amyloid-β and pTau Associations:** Microglial gene expression changes were more strongly associated with amyloid-β than pTau (109 vs. 27 uniquely upregulated genes; 82 upregulated with both, see Fig. 2f).
- **Key Upregulated Genes:** APOE, MS4A6A, PILRA, STARD13, GPNMB, LRRK2, SNCA, GRN, ASAH1, ATG7, MYO1E. These genes are involved in lipid metabolism, autophagy, phagocytosis, and inflammation.
- **Pathways:** Enrichment for selective autophagy, microglial pathogen phagocytosis, proteostasis, and complement activation (see Fig. 4). IL1-related pathways were specifically enriched with pTau.
- **Downregulated Genes:** TLR2, TLR10, HK2, JAK2, ITGAM (CD11b) were among the few genes negatively associated with pathology.

**Gene Co-expression Networks and Regulons**
- **APOE as a Hub:** APOE was a central hub in a microglial module (module 19) co-expressed with TREM2, complement, and inflammatory genes, functionally enriched for phagocytosis and antigen presentation. <keyFinding priority='1'>APOE is a key hub in disease-associated microglial networks, linking phagocytic, complement, and inflammatory pathways.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **GPNMB Module:** GPNMB was a hub in modules 11 and 34, both upregulated with amyloid-β and pTau, and enriched for lipid homeostasis, autophagy, and lysosomal function. GPNMB expression was validated by immunohistochemistry, showing increased density in AD cortex (mean ~1.8-fold increase vs. controls; Fig. 5b,c). <keyFinding priority='1'>GPNMB is a robust marker of disease-associated microglia and PVMs, validated at the protein level, and is linked to lipid metabolism and autophagy.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **Transcriptional Regulators:** MAFG, MITF, JUND, CEBPA, CEBPD, and PBX3 regulons were upregulated in disease-associated microglia.

**Cell-Cell Communication**
- Increased APP (astrocyte)–CD74 (microglia) and complement (C3/C4A–C3AR1) ligand-receptor interactions with pathology, suggesting enhanced cross-talk in AD.

**Spatial/Morphological Validation**
- GPNMB immunostaining confirmed increased microglial and PVM expression in AD cortex, correlating with snRNA-seq module expression and local pTau/amyloid-β burden.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**
- Micro2 and PVM subclusters increased in proportion with greater amyloid-β and pTau pathology, suggesting a shift from homeostatic to disease-associated states with disease progression.

**Genetic Modulators**
- AD GWAS genes (APOE, MS4A6A, PILRA, LRRK2, GRN) were upregulated in disease-associated microglia, supporting a genetic contribution to these states.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
Microglia in AD show a marked shift from homeostatic to disease-associated states (notably Micro2), characterized by upregulation of genes and pathways involved in phagocytosis, autophagy, lipid metabolism, and inflammation. These states are strongly associated with local amyloid-β and, to a lesser extent, pTau pathology. APOE and GPNMB emerge as central hubs in disease-associated microglial networks, with GPNMB validated as a protein biomarker of microglial activation in AD. The findings suggest that microglial responses to pathology are both genetically and regionally modulated, and that microglial subtypes may serve as therapeutic or biomarker targets. However, causal or temporal relationships remain associative due to the cross-sectional nature of the data.

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**
This study identifies three main microglial subtypes in human Alzheimer’s disease cortex, with Micro2 representing a disease-associated state marked by upregulation of APOE, MS4A6A, PILRA, and GPNMB, and enriched for phagocytosis, autophagy, and inflammatory pathways. The proportion of Micro2 and perivascular macrophages increases with local amyloid-β and pTau pathology. GPNMB is validated as a robust protein marker of disease-associated microglia and is linked to lipid metabolism and autophagy. These microglial states are strongly modulated by AD genetic risk factors, notably APOE.

**Research Implications (≈150 words):**
This work provides a detailed map of microglial heterogeneity in human AD, highlighting the prominence of a disease-associated microglial state (Micro2) that integrates genetic risk (APOE, MS4A6A, PILRA), lipid metabolism, and inflammatory responses. The identification and validation of GPNMB as a marker of these states, and its co-expression with autophagy and lipid homeostasis genes, suggest new avenues for biomarker development and therapeutic targeting. The study’s findings align with, but also extend, prior DAM/ARM/IRM classifications from mouse models, emphasizing the complexity and partial overlap of human microglial states. The explicit association of microglial subtypes with local pathology and genetic risk supports a model in which microglial activation is both a driver and a marker of disease progression. Open questions remain regarding the functional consequences of these states, their temporal dynamics, and their potential reversibility, which will require longitudinal and experimental studies for resolution. No explicit contradictions with prior models were discussed by the authors.

# summary for Sorrells 2019 (microglia)

1) **Quick Reference**

This review (Page et al., 2022, Dev Cogn Neurosci) provides a comprehensive developmental and anatomical analysis of the human amygdala paralaminar nucleus (PL), focusing on the protracted maturation of excitatory neurons from birth through adolescence. Microglia are present throughout the PL, but the paper reports minimal findings regarding microglial subtypes, activation states, or disease associations in this context. The primary cellular focus is on excitatory neurons, with only brief mention of glial populations, including microglia, whose roles in PL maturation remain undetermined.

</metadata>

<methods>
This is a review and synthesis of histological, immunohistochemical, and single-cell RNA-seq studies (including Sorrells et al., 2019) on human and primate amygdala, with a focus on the paralaminar nucleus (PL). The primary tissue sources are postmortem human brains across the lifespan, with some reference to non-human primate and rodent data. The review integrates findings from immunostaining (e.g., DCX, NEUN, PSA-NCAM, BCL-2, SOX2, Ki-67), single-cell RNA-seq, and MRI-based volumetric studies.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Subtypes:**
Microglia are acknowledged as a component of the PL’s cellular milieu, but the review does not provide quantitative data on microglial abundance, subtypes, or age-related changes. The main focus is on excitatory neurons, with detailed quantification of immature (DCX+, PSA-NCAM+) and mature (NEUN+) neuronal populations, and a brief mention of astrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells.

**Microglial Subtypes and Markers:**
The paper does not identify or characterize distinct microglial subtypes or states within the PL. There is no discussion of microglial marker gene expression (e.g., TMEM119, P2RY12, IBA1) or microglial activation profiles in the context of PL development or disease. Microglia are depicted in schematic figures (e.g., Fig. 2, Fig. 5) as part of the local environment, but without molecular or functional detail.

**Functional Role and Disease Association:**
The review notes that glia, including microglia, are present throughout the PL and may influence neuron maturation, migration, and synaptogenesis, referencing general roles for glia in CNS development (<keyFinding priority='2'>). However, it explicitly states that "it is currently unknown if or how glia contribute to the uniquely delayed developmental trajectory of this region" (<confidenceLevel>low</confidenceLevel>). There is no evidence presented for microglial involvement in the protracted maturation of PL neurons, nor for microglial modulation by age, sex, or genetic factors in this context.

**Spatial and Morphological Data:**
Microglia are illustrated as part of the PL’s cytoarchitecture, but no spatial transcriptomics, in situ hybridization, or immunostaining specific to microglia is reported. No morphological or activation state data for microglia are provided.

**Modulators and Metrics:**
No data are presented on host or genetic factors (e.g., age, sex, APOE, GWAS variants) influencing microglial states in the PL. The review discusses sex hormone effects on neuronal maturation, but not on microglia.

**Gene Regulatory Networks and Cell-Cell Communication:**
There is no discussion of microglial gene regulatory networks, ligand-receptor interactions, or microglia-neuron cross-talk in the PL.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**
The review does not address microglial changes across developmental or disease trajectories in the PL. All temporal modelling and pseudotime analyses are focused on neuronal populations.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**
No eQTL, GWAS, or multi-omic data linking microglial states to neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric risk are presented for the PL.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

</findings>

<clinical>
The review does not provide evidence for a disease-specific role of microglia in the PL. While it discusses the potential relevance of PL maturation to neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., ASD, MDD, early life adversity), microglia are not implicated as mediators or biomarkers in these contexts. The possible contribution of glia to PL development is acknowledged as an open question, but no mechanistic or therapeutic implications are proposed for microglia.
</clinical>

---

3) **Research Implications**

This review highlights a significant gap in our understanding of microglial heterogeneity and function in the human amygdala paralaminar nucleus during development. While microglia are present and likely interact with maturing neurons, the paper does not report any microglial subtypes, marker genes, or functional states specific to the PL. There is no evidence for microglial involvement in the protracted neuronal maturation that characterizes this region, nor for modulation by sex, age, or genetic risk factors. The authors explicitly note the lack of data on glial (including microglial) contributions to PL development, suggesting this as a critical area for future research. Integration of single-cell or spatial transcriptomics focused on microglia, alongside functional and morphological studies, will be necessary to determine whether microglial subtypes or activation states play a role in PL maturation or neuropsychiatric vulnerability. No conflicts with prior microglial models are discussed.

**Cell Type Proportions and Heterogeneity**
The study identifies 12 robust microglial subtypes (clusters 1–12), consistently present across diseases and CNS regions, with clusters 1–6 comprising the majority of microglia in most individuals. Disease-associated subtypes are minor in abundance but show strong transcriptional divergence.

**Subtype Identification and Characterization**
- **Cluster 1**: Largest population; upregulates ITPR2, SORL1, MEF2A, RUNX1, CELF1.

- Cluster 10 is enriched for MS and schizophrenia risk genes, aligning with its complement expression.
- Cluster 11 (DAM2^high) is modestly enriched for AD and amyloid pathology genes, but not tau.
- Cluster 8 is associated with neuroinflammatory but not neurodegenerative disease genes.

**Pathway and Functional Enrichment**
- A central metabolic divide separates clusters 1/6/7 (heterocyclic/nitrogen metabolism, transcriptional regulation) from clusters 2/4/9 (oxidative phosphorylation, immune response).
- Clusters 8 and 10 are both immunologically activated but differ in pathway enrichment (interferon/IL signaling vs. antigen presentation/complement).
- Pseudotime and machine learning analyses support a nonlinear, branching trajectory of microglial states, with cluster 3 as a central node.

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**
- RNAscope-immunofluorescence and MERFISH confirm in situ existence of key subtypes (e.g., CD74^high/cluster 10, CXCR4^high/cluster 8, SPP1^high/cluster 11).
- Morphological analysis shows CD74^high and SPP1^high microglia are less ramified (activation-associated), while CXCR4^high cells are more ramified.

**Modulators & Metrics**
- Subtype proportions are consistent across donors, regions, and diseases, but disease-associated subtypes are minor.
- No substantial modulation by age, sex, or region is reported, but larger datasets are needed for statistical power.

**Cell-Cell Communication**
- Cluster 10 shows upregulation of antigen presentation and complement pathways, suggesting enhanced cross-talk with adaptive immunity.

**Integration with Model Systems**
- Label transfer demonstrates that iPSC-derived microglia and xenograft models recapitulate much of the in vivo heterogeneity, including disease-associated states.

**Chemical Modulation**
- Connectivity Map (CMAP) analysis identifies compounds (e.g., camptothecin) that can induce or suppress specific microglial subtype signatures in vitro, validated by RNA and proteomics.

Microglial subtypes show distinct associations with neurodegenerative disease risk and pathology. Homeostatic-divergent subtypes (clusters 1/6) are strongly enriched for AD, MS, and PD risk genes and are upregulated in AD cortex, suggesting a role in disease susceptibility and progression. DAM2^high (cluster 11) is specifically linked to amyloid pathology, while antigen-presenting (CD74^high, cluster 10) and stress-response (CXCR4^high, cluster 8) subtypes may mediate immune activation and cross-talk. The ability to pharmacologically modulate these states in vitro (e.g., camptothecin suppressing disease-enriched signatures and upregulating AD-associated ones) highlights potential therapeutic avenues for targeted microglial immunomodulation. However, most findings are associative, and causal roles require further validation.

**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**
This study defines 12 robust human microglial subtypes across neurological diseases, revealing a central metabolic divide and multiple disease-enriched states. Key findings include a homeostatic-divergent cluster (1/6) enriched for AD, MS, and PD risk genes, a CD74^high antigen-presenting subtype (cluster 10) with DAM2 and complement signatures, and a SPP1^high DAM2^high subtype (cluster 11) linked to amyloid pathology. Subtypes are validated in situ and can be recapitulated in iPSC models; camptothecin downregulates disease-enriched signatures and upregulates AD-associated ones. Disease risk gene enrichment is strongest in clusters 1/6, with minor subtypes showing specific pathological associations.

<metadata>
Tuddenham et al. (2024, Nature Neuroscience) present a comprehensive single-cell RNA-seq resource of 215,680 live human microglia from 74 donors, spanning 12 CNS regions and a spectrum of neurological diseases, including Alzheimer’s disease (AD), multiple sclerosis (MS), ALS, FTD, Parkinsonism, epilepsy, stroke, and controls.
</metadata>
<methods>
Microglia were isolated using cold, enzyme-free mechanical dissociation to preserve native transcriptional states, followed by FACS sorting of CD45+ cells and droplet-based scRNA-seq. Subtype validation was performed with RNAscope-immunofluorescence and high-dimensional MERFISH in situ hybridization. Additional cross-validation included label transfer to external datasets and in vitro recapitulation using iPSC-derived microglia and chemical perturbation.
</methods>
<findings>
The authors identify 12 robust microglial subtypes (clusters 1–12), consistently present across diseases and CNS regions. Clusters 1–6 comprise the majority of microglia in most individuals, while disease-associated subtypes are minor in abundance but show strong transcriptional divergence.

**Subtype Identification and Characterization**
- **Cluster 1** is the largest population, upregulating ITPR2, SORL1, MEF2A, RUNX1, and CELF1. It is functionally divergent from homeostatic microglia and enriched for genes associated with neurodegenerative disease risk. <keyFinding priority='1'>This cluster represents a major homeostatic-divergent subtype, enriched for AD/MS/PD risk genes.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **Clusters 2 & 3** express classical homeostatic markers (CX3CR1, FCGR1A, P2RY12). Cluster 3 is transcriptionally intermediate between clusters 1 and 2.

- Cluster 10 is enriched for MS and schizophrenia risk genes, aligning with its complement expression.
- Cluster 11 (DAM2^high) is modestly enriched for AD and amyloid pathology genes, but not tau.
- Cluster 8 is associated with neuroinflammatory but not neurodegenerative disease genes.

**Pathway and Functional Enrichment**
- A central metabolic divide separates clusters 1/6/7 (heterocyclic/nitrogen metabolism, transcriptional regulation) from clusters 2/4/9 (oxidative phosphorylation, immune response).
- Clusters 8 and 10 are both immunologically activated but differ in pathway enrichment (interferon/IL signaling vs. antigen presentation/complement).
- Pseudotime and machine learning analyses support a nonlinear, branching trajectory of microglial states, with cluster 3 as a central node.

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**
- RNAscope-immunofluorescence and MERFISH confirm in situ existence of key subtypes (e.g., CD74^high/cluster 10, CXCR4^high/cluster 8, SPP1^high/cluster 11).

**Research Implications (≈150 words):**
This resource provides a high-confidence, cross-disease reference for human microglial heterogeneity, enabling annotation of external datasets and model systems. The identification of robust, disease-enriched subtypes—particularly the homeostatic-divergent (1/6), CD74^high antigen-presenting (10), and SPP1^high DAM2^high (11) microglia—offers new targets for mechanistic and therapeutic studies. The study’s in situ and in vitro validation strategies, including chemical recapitulation of subtype signatures, pave the way for functional dissection and pharmacological manipulation of microglial states. Open questions remain regarding the causal roles of these subtypes in disease progression, their temporal dynamics, and the impact of host factors (age, sex, genotype) on their abundance and function. The authors note that their findings align with, but also extend, prior mouse and human data, especially in resolving DAM-like states and metabolic axes. No explicit contradictions with prior models are discussed, but the study highlights the need for larger, region- and disease-specific cohorts to resolve subtle modulators of microglial heterogeneity.

# summary for Velmeshev 2019 (microglia)

**Quick Reference (≈100 words)**  
Velmeshev et al. (Science, 2019) used single-nucleus RNA-seq of prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortex from autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and control brains to reveal that microglia in ASD exhibit a distinct transcriptional state marked by upregulation of activation- and development-associated genes. Microglial gene expression changes were among the most strongly correlated with clinical severity of ASD, second only to upper-layer excitatory neurons. The altered microglial state was not attributable to epilepsy comorbidity, and included upregulation of genes involved in activation and developmental transcriptional regulation. <keyFinding priority='1'>Microglial dysregulation is a core, clinically relevant feature of ASD cortical pathology.</keyFinding>

Disease focus: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)
</metadata>

<methods>
The study performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) using the 10x Genomics platform on postmortem prefrontal cortex (PFC) and anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) samples from 15 ASD patients and 16 matched controls (ages 4–22). Additional samples from epilepsy patients and controls were included for comparison. Nuclei were isolated from snap-frozen tissue, and unbiased clustering identified 17 major cell types, including microglia. Validation included in situ RNA hybridization and comparison to bulk RNA-seq.
</methods>

<findings>
Microglia were robustly identified as a distinct cluster in the snRNA-seq data (see Fig. 1C, G). The study found that microglia from ASD samples displayed a unique transcriptional profile compared to controls. 

**Cell Type Proportions:**  
There was no explicit report of a significant change in the overall proportion of microglia between ASD and control samples, but microglia were among the cell types with the highest burden of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in ASD (Fig. 2I).

**Differential Gene Expression:**  
Microglia in ASD showed upregulation of genes associated with microglial activation and developmental transcriptional regulation (fig. S4D). Specific marker genes for the ASD-associated microglial state were not exhaustively listed in the main text, but the volcano plot (Fig. 2B) highlights several upregulated genes in microglia, including *PTGS2*, *H3F3B*, *CDC37*, and *SH3TC1*. These genes are linked to immune activation and developmental processes. <keyFinding priority='1'>Microglial DEGs in ASD are enriched for activation and developmental regulators.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Pathway Enrichment:**  
Unlike neurons, glial DEGs (including microglia) did not show significant enrichment for specific Gene Ontology (GO) pathways in the main analysis (Fig. 2F, S4A). However, the upregulated genes in microglia were associated with activation and developmental transcriptional programs (fig. S4D), suggesting a shift in microglial state rather than engagement of canonical immune pathways. <keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial changes in ASD reflect altered developmental and activation states rather than classical immune response pathways.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
The study did not subdivide microglia into multiple subtypes or states beyond the identification of an ASD-associated transcriptional profile. The altered state is characterized by upregulation of activation and developmental genes, but no distinct microglial subclusters were reported. <keyFinding priority='2'>Microglia in ASD represent a transcriptionally distinct, activated state rather than multiple discrete subtypes.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
The microglial transcriptional changes were not attributable to epilepsy comorbidity, as comparison with epilepsy-only samples showed that ASD-specific changes were distinct and not shared with epilepsy (fig. S6, A–C, H). There was no explicit analysis of genetic risk factors (e.g., GWAS, eQTL) specifically in microglia, but overall, microglial DEGs did not show significant overlap with top ASD genetic risk genes (Fig. 2E).

**Gene Regulatory Networks:**  
Upregulated genes in ASD microglia included transcriptional regulators involved in developmental processes, but specific transcription factors were not detailed for microglia in the main text.

**Cell-Cell Communication:**  
No specific ligand-receptor or cell-cell communication findings were reported for microglia.

**Spatial Analysis:**  
No spatial or morphological validation of microglial states was presented.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
The study did not perform pseudotime or trajectory analysis for microglia, but the upregulation of developmental transcriptional programs suggests a possible reversion to or persistence of immature or activated states in ASD.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
No direct integration of microglial transcriptomic changes with genetic risk variants was reported.

**Clinical Correlation:**  
Microglial gene expression changes were among the most strongly correlated with clinical severity of ASD, as measured by the Autism Diagnostic Interview–Revised (ADI-R) scores (Fig. 4B, D). Hierarchical clustering of ASD patients based on microglial DEGs grouped individuals according to clinical severity, independent of epilepsy comorbidity, age, or sex. <keyFinding priority='1'>Microglial transcriptional dysregulation is strongly associated with ASD clinical severity.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

</findings>

<clinical>
The study demonstrates that microglia in ASD brains adopt a distinct, activated transcriptional state, with upregulation of genes involved in activation and developmental regulation. This altered microglial state is not explained by epilepsy comorbidity and is strongly associated with the clinical severity of ASD symptoms. While the functional consequences of this microglial dysregulation remain to be fully elucidated, these findings suggest that microglial activation and altered developmental programs may contribute to ASD pathophysiology and could represent potential therapeutic or biomarker targets. <keyFinding priority='1'>Microglial state is a core, clinically relevant feature of ASD cortical pathology.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**  
This study establishes that microglial transcriptional dysregulation is a robust and clinically relevant feature of ASD cortex, second only to upper-layer excitatory neurons in its correlation with symptom severity. The ASD-associated microglial state is characterized by upregulation of activation and developmental genes, but the study does not identify discrete microglial subtypes or provide spatial/morphological validation. Open questions include whether this state reflects persistent developmental immaturity, aberrant activation, or a unique ASD-specific phenotype, and how it interacts with neuronal pathology. The lack of overlap between microglial DEGs and top ASD genetic risk genes suggests that microglial changes may be secondary to neuronal dysfunction or reflect environmental influences. Future work should address the functional impact of these microglial changes, their temporal dynamics, and their potential as therapeutic targets. The findings are consistent with, but extend beyond, prior bulk transcriptomic studies by providing cell type–specific resolution. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on postmortem substantia nigra (SN) tissue from 32 donors (23 idiopathic PD, 9 controls; mean age ~81). 10x Genomics Chromium platform was used, yielding 315,867 high-quality nuclei after QC and doublet removal. Cell type annotation was based on canonical markers and de novo signatures. Validation included immunohistochemistry (IHC), RNAscope in situ hybridization, and comparison to independent human and mouse datasets, as well as human midbrain organoids.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and General Features**
Microglia (cluster c1) comprised 9.4% of all nuclei in the SN, making them the third most abundant glial cell type after oligodendrocytes and astrocytes.

**Microglial Subtype Identification and Characterization**
The authors identified a single main microglial cluster (c1) based on canonical markers (C3, CSF1R, CD74, TYROBP). No further subclustering of microglia was reported, and the study did not describe distinct microglial subtypes or states (e.g., homeostatic vs. disease-associated microglia) within the SN. <keyFinding priority='3'>No evidence for major microglial heterogeneity or emergence of disease-associated microglial states in PD SN.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

- Upregulation of genes involved in translation and heat shock protein family members (e.g., HSPB1, HSPH1, HSPA1, HSP90AA1) was observed across multiple cell types, including microglia, but this was not microglia-specific.
- Metallothionein family genes (MT2A, MT1E, MT3) were broadly upregulated, including in microglia, consistent with a general stress response.
- No strong enrichment for inflammatory, phagocytic, or disease-associated microglial (DAM) signatures was detected.

**Modulators & Metrics**
The study did not report significant modulation of microglial states by host factors (age, sex, genotype) or by PD GWAS risk variants. LRRK2 (PARK8), a key PD risk gene, was highly expressed in microglia, but its expression was not significantly altered in PD. <keyFinding priority='2'>LRRK2 is microglia-enriched but not differentially expressed in PD SN.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Gene Regulatory Networks**
The only regulatory network highlighted was the TYROBP-centered module, which was downregulated in PD microglia.

**Cell-Cell Communication**
CellChat analysis revealed a global increase in predicted cell-cell communication for microglia in PD, despite the apparent immunosuppression signature. However, the specific ligand-receptor pathways altered in microglia were not detailed. <keyFinding priority='2'>Microglia show increased predicted cell-cell communication in PD, but the functional significance is unclear.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Spatial Analysis and Validation**
No spatial or morphological validation of microglial states was reported.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**
No evidence for microglial activation or transition to disease-associated states was found in relation to Braak stage or disease progression.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**
No microglial subpopulations were linked to PD GWAS risk variants or eQTLs.

**Contradictions/Departures from Prior Data**
The authors explicitly note that, contrary to some previous reports of microglial activation in PD (e.g., increased MHC-II, ICAM-1, or TSPO binding), their data do not support extensive activation or emergence of disease-associated microglia in the SN at advanced PD stages. They suggest that microglia may become less active or more dystrophic in late-stage PD. <keyFinding priority='1'>Absence of disease-associated microglial activation in advanced PD SN contrasts with some prior studies; authors attribute this to disease stage or methodological differences.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
The study suggests that microglia in the human SN do not undergo robust activation or transition to disease-associated states in advanced PD, as assessed by snRNA-seq. Instead, microglia may exhibit immunosuppression, as indicated by downregulation of TYROBP signaling. This finding challenges the prevailing view that microglial activation is a major driver of neurodegeneration in PD, at least in late-stage disease. The lack of microglial activation or emergence of DAM-like states implies that targeting microglial inflammation may be less relevant for therapeutic intervention in advanced PD, though the possibility remains for earlier disease stages. The enrichment of LRRK2 in microglia, despite stable expression in PD, continues to support microglia as a potential site of action for genetic risk, but without clear disease-associated activation signatures.
</clinical>

---

**Quick Reference**
Microglia in the human substantia nigra show no significant change in abundance or emergence of disease-associated subtypes in Parkinson’s disease, but display downregulation of a TYROBP-centered network suggestive of immunosuppression. LRRK2 is highly expressed in microglia but not differentially regulated in PD, and the absence of microglial activation in advanced PD contrasts with some prior reports.

---

**Research Implications**
This study provides strong evidence that, in advanced Parkinson’s disease, microglia in the substantia nigra do not exhibit the robust activation or disease-associated phenotypes (e.g., DAM) reported in some earlier studies or in other neurodegenerative contexts. The downregulation of TYROBP signaling and lack of inflammatory gene upregulation suggest a shift toward immunosuppression or dystrophy, rather than activation. This finding is explicitly discussed as a departure from prior models, which often relied on earlier-stage disease, different brain regions, or alternative detection methods (e.g., TSPO PET, MHC-II staining). The authors propose that microglial activation may be transient or restricted to earlier disease stages, or that methodological differences (e.g., single-nucleus vs. bulk or spatial profiling) account for the discrepancy. Future research should address microglial dynamics across disease progression, employ spatial and morphological validation, and explore whether microglial phenotypes differ in other brain regions or in prodromal/early PD. The stable expression of LRRK2 in microglia, despite its genetic association with PD, raises questions about the functional consequences of risk variants in the absence of overt activation. Overall, these results caution against assuming a universal role for microglial activation in PD pathogenesis and highlight the need for stage- and region-specific analyses.

The authors explicitly note that their failure to detect microglial activation or DAM-like states in advanced PD SN contrasts with previous reports of microglial activation in PD (e.g., MHC-II, ICAM-1, TSPO PET), and suggest this may reflect disease stage, region, or methodological differences.

# summary for Wang June 2024 (microglia)

1) **Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This study uses single-nucleus multiome profiling of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex from C9orf72 ALS/FTD patients, stratified by pTDP-43 pathology, to reveal microglial heterogeneity and disease-stage-specific alterations. Four microglial subtypes were identified, including a major homeostatic/activating cluster (MG-1) and a neurosurveillance cluster (MG-3) that is significantly depleted in both early (TDPneg) and late (TDPhigh) disease stages. Early disease is marked by upregulation of complement gene C3 and IRF8 in microglia, while late stages show increased interferon response genes (CDK6, CD86, SUN2). Microglial changes are closely linked to pTDP-43 burden, with the neurosurveillance MG-3 subtype showing parallels to Alzheimer’s disease and being highly enriched for C9orf72 expression.

</metadata>

<methods>
The authors performed single-nucleus multiome (snRNA-seq + snATAC-seq) profiling on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (BA9) from 19 C9orf72 ALS/FTD patients and 7 controls, stratifying cases into TDPneg, TDPmed, and TDPhigh groups based on quantitative pTDP-43 immunoassay and histopathology. Two independent cohorts (Emory, Mayo) were analyzed in parallel due to batch effects. Cell type identification and subclustering were performed using integrated transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility data, with rigorous batch correction and validation of cell type markers. Differential gene expression and chromatin accessibility were assessed using linear mixed models and pseudobulk approaches.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Identification**

Microglia comprised ~5% of all nuclei, with the highest C9orf72 expression among cortical cell types. In the Emory cohort, four distinct microglial clusters were identified:
- **MG-1**: The largest cluster, expressing homeostatic markers (CX3CR1, TMEM119, CSF1R) and activation markers (CD86, CD80, C1QA/B/C, CCL2/3, IL1A, IL18). Enriched for SPI1 (PU.1) and IRF8 motifs, indicating a mixed homeostatic/activating state.
- **MG-2 & MG-3**: Both show reduced homeostatic gene expression and moderate expression of M2-like (anti-inflammatory) markers. MG-2 is defined by neurotrophic factors (BDNF, GDNF, NTS), cell adhesion, and complement receptor CR1. MG-3 expresses neurotrophic factors (BDNF, GDNF, NGF), serotonin receptors, and G-protein-coupled signaling genes.
- **MG-4**: Expresses both microglial and astrocytic markers (GFAP, VCAN, AQP4, PAX6), suggesting a transitional or hybrid glial state.

The Mayo cohort recapitulated these subtypes, though with less distinct separation due to lower microglial yield.

**Subtype-Specific Disease Associations**

- **MG-3 (Neurosurveillance Microglia)**: This cluster is significantly depleted in both TDPneg and TDPhigh groups compared to controls, with further reduction in TDPhigh. The loss appears independent of pTDP-43 at early stages but is exacerbated as pathology accumulates. MG-3 shares marker genes (INO80D, PRRC2C) and transcriptomic similarity with the MG-1 neurosurveillance cluster described in AD (Sun et al., 2023), suggesting a conserved surveillance function across neurodegenerative diseases. <keyFinding priority='1'>Loss of MG-3 neurosurveillance microglia is a hallmark of both early and late C9orf72 ALS/FTD, paralleling AD progression.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

- **MG-1 (Homeostatic/Activating Microglia)**: While not depleted, this cluster shows upregulation of inflammatory and antigen presentation genes, especially in late disease.

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**

- **Early Disease (TDPneg)**: Microglia upregulate complement gene **C3** and transcription factor **IRF8**. C3 is central to the complement cascade, mediating synaptic pruning and phagocytosis. Its upregulation in microglia is observed only in early-stage C9orf72 ALS/FTD, mirroring early AD, where complement activation precedes overt pathology. IRF8 is a key driver of microglial activation. <keyFinding priority='2'>Early complement activation (C3 upregulation) in microglia may contribute to synaptic loss before pTDP-43 aggregation.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

- **Late Disease (TDPhigh)**: Microglia show upregulation of interferon response genes (**CDK6**, **CD86**, **SUN2**). CDK6 is also upregulated in FTLD-GRN, suggesting a shared TDP-43 proteinopathy signature. CD86 and SUN2 are interferon-stimulated genes, indicating a shift from complement to interferon-driven inflammation in late disease. <keyFinding priority='2'>Interferon response replaces complement activation in microglia at late disease stages with high pTDP-43.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

- **C9orf72 Expression**: Remains highest in microglia, but no significant change in expression between disease and control, suggesting that loss-of-function is not due to transcriptional downregulation.

**Chromatin Accessibility and Regulatory Networks**

- Differentially accessible regions (DARs) in microglia are enriched for motifs of transcription factors involved in cell differentiation (EGR1, KLF5, ZNF263), with CTCF motifs prominent in microglia, OPCs, and oligodendrocytes. SPI1 (PU.1) and IRF8 motifs are specifically enriched in MG-1, supporting their role in microglial activation.

**Cell-Cell Communication and Disease Mechanisms**

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**

- The depletion of MG-3 neurosurveillance microglia occurs early, before pTDP-43 aggregation, and worsens with disease progression. Complement activation is restricted to early stages, while interferon responses dominate late stages.

**Genetic Modulators**

- The study highlights that microglia are the primary site of C9orf72 expression, but does not identify specific genetic or demographic modifiers of microglial subtypes within the C9orf72 ALS/FTD cohort.

<clinical>
Microglial dysfunction emerges as an early and persistent feature of C9orf72 ALS/FTD, with loss of neurosurveillance (MG-3) microglia and early complement activation (C3 upregulation) potentially driving synaptic loss and neuronal vulnerability. The transition to interferon-driven inflammation in late disease suggests stage-specific mechanisms. These findings imply that microglial subtypes and their molecular signatures could serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets, with the MG-3 neurosurveillance population representing a potential point of intervention to preserve neuronal integrity. The parallels to AD microglial changes suggest shared neuroimmune pathways across neurodegenerative diseases, though the temporal dynamics of complement and interferon responses may differ.

3) **Research Implications (≈150 words)**

This study provides a detailed map of microglial heterogeneity and stage-specific molecular changes in C9orf72 ALS/FTD, highlighting the early and persistent loss of neurosurveillance microglia (MG-3) and a dynamic shift from complement to interferon-driven inflammation. The identification of MG-3 as a conserved neurosurveillance subtype, also depleted in AD, suggests a shared vulnerability axis across neurodegenerative diseases. The early upregulation of C3 in microglia and its potential role in targeting projection neurons for synaptic pruning raises the possibility that complement inhibition could be neuroprotective if applied early. The transition to interferon responses in late disease may require distinct therapeutic strategies. Open questions include the precise functional role of MG-3 microglia, the reversibility of their loss, and whether their preservation can alter disease trajectory. The study’s findings align with emerging microglial classification schemes and reinforce the need for stage- and subtype-specific interventions in ALS/FTD and related disorders.

**Cell-Cell Communication and Shared Pathways**
Network proximity analyses reveal significant overlap and interaction between DAM and disease-associated astrocyte (DAA) networks, with shared genes (*APOE*, *CD9*, *LGALS3BP*, *CTSB*, *CTSD*) and immune pathways (e.g., Th17 differentiation, chemokine signaling). <keyFinding priority='2'>DAM and DAA share immune signaling modules, suggesting coordinated neuroinflammatory responses.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Metabolic Modulation**

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**
The study does not explicitly model microglial state transitions over time, but the increased DAM abundance in 5XFAD mice (an AD model) suggests a disease-stage association.

**Contradictions/Departures**
The authors note that DAM marker gene upregulation (e.g., *Lpl*, *Cst7*) is not always observed in human AD brains, highlighting species differences and the need for caution in extrapolating mouse DAM signatures to humans. <contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag> (Explicitly discussed: "up-regulation of two mouse DAM marker genes (Lpl and Cst7) cannot be detected in human AD brains.")

</findings>

<clinical>
DAM are strongly associated with AD pathology in mouse models, with their expansion and gene expression signatures reflecting neuroinflammatory activation. The DAM network is enriched for AD risk genes, suggesting that genetic susceptibility may act through microglial dysfunction. Key DAM regulators (*PAK1*, *MAPK14*, *CSF1R*) and shared immune/metabolic pathways represent potential therapeutic targets. The study identifies fluticasone and mometasone (glucocorticoid receptor agonists) as candidate drugs that may reduce AD risk, potentially by modulating DAM and DAA networks, as supported by retrospective patient data. However, the causal role of DAM in human AD remains to be fully established, and species differences in DAM signatures warrant further investigation.
</clinical>

---

**Quick Reference**
This study demonstrates that disease-associated microglia (DAM) are significantly expanded in AD mouse models, defined by upregulation of *Cst7*, *Lpl*, *Apoe*, and downregulation of *P2ry12*, *Cx3cr1*. DAM networks are enriched for AD risk genes (notably *BIN1*) and immune pathways, with *PAK1*, *MAPK14*, and *CSF1R* as key regulators. DAM abundance and gene signatures are strongly associated with AD pathology and genetic risk.

---

**Research Implications**
The identification of DAM as a distinct, disease-associated microglial state with a robust molecular signature in mouse models advances our understanding of microglial heterogeneity in AD. The enrichment of AD risk genes within DAM networks supports the hypothesis that genetic susceptibility converges on microglial dysfunction. However, the lack of full concordance between mouse and human DAM signatures (e.g., *Lpl*, *Cst7* upregulation not seen in human AD) highlights the need for improved cross-species models and direct validation in human tissue. Open questions include the precise causal role of DAM in AD progression, the temporal dynamics of DAM emergence, and the therapeutic potential of targeting DAM regulators such as *PAK1*, *MAPK14*, and *CSF1R*. The study’s network-based drug repurposing approach, validated in large patient cohorts, suggests a promising avenue for translating single-cell findings into clinical interventions, but further experimental and clinical validation is required. <contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag> (Explicitly discussed: species differences in DAM marker expression between mouse and human AD brains.)

# summary for Yang 2021 (microglia)

**Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This study (Yang et al., 2021, Nature) used single-nucleus RNA-seq of human frontal cortex and choroid plexus to profile cellular changes in severe COVID-19. Microglia exhibited a distinct disease-associated subpopulation in COVID-19, marked by upregulation of C1QC, CD74, FTL, and FTH1, and downregulation of homeostatic markers such as P2RY12. This subpopulation was significantly expanded in COVID-19 brains and overlapped with microglial states seen in neurodegenerative diseases, but also showed unique features (e.g., RIPK1 upregulation). Activation was validated by CD68 immunostaining and was not driven by direct viral neuroinvasion, but rather by peripheral inflammation relayed via brain barriers.

Validation included RT-qPCR, immunohistochemistry (CD68), and multiple assays for SARS-CoV-2 RNA/protein, none of which detected viral neuroinvasion.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Microglia comprised a substantial fraction of immune cells in the cortex. A distinct microglial subpopulation (termed "COVID-19-associated microglia") was significantly expanded in COVID-19 brains compared to controls (P = 0.0343, Mann–Whitney test).

**Differential Gene Expression:**  
The COVID-19-associated microglial subcluster was defined by upregulation of activation and inflammatory genes, including C1QC, CD74, FTL, FTH1, and CD14, and downregulation of homeostatic microglial markers such as P2RY12 and MEF2C. Notably, RIPK1, a gene implicated in neuroinflammation, was specifically upregulated in this COVID-19 microglial state but not in neurodegenerative disease-associated microglia. <keyFinding priority='1'>This transcriptional profile indicates a shift from homeostatic to activated, potentially neurotoxic microglial states.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Pathway Enrichment:**

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
- **Homeostatic Microglia:**  
  - Markers: P2RY12, MEF2C, IRAK3  
  - Function: Surveillance, maintenance of CNS homeostasis  
  - Proportion: Decreased in COVID-19, as microglia shift toward activated states.

  - Markers: Upregulated C1QC, CD74, FTL, FTH1, CD14, RIPK1; downregulated P2RY12, MEF2C  
  - Function: Activated, inflammatory, and potentially neurotoxic; overlap with disease-associated microglia (DAM/ARM/Mic1) from neurodegenerative disease, but with unique features (e.g., RIPK1).  
  - Disease Association: Significantly expanded in COVID-19 brains; trajectory analysis suggests these arise from homeostatic microglia in response to CNS inflammation.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
Pseudotime analysis indicated that COVID-19-associated microglia emerge from the homeostatic population along an activation trajectory, consistent with a response to an inflamed CNS environment rather than direct viral infection.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
Overlap analysis showed that genes upregulated in COVID-19 microglia significantly intersect with those in microglial states from Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative conditions (P = 2.3 × 10^-15, hypergeometric test), but also include unique COVID-19-specific genes (e.g., RIPK1). <keyFinding priority='2'>COVID-19 microglial states partially recapitulate, but are not identical to, those in chronic neurodegeneration.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>  
The authors explicitly note that while there is overlap with DAM/ARM/Mic1, the COVID-19 microglial state is distinct, particularly in the upregulation of certain inflammatory genes.

**Cell-Cell Communication:**  
CellChat analysis predicted increased complement and chemokine signaling from choroid plexus and barrier cells to microglia in COVID-19, supporting a model where peripheral inflammation is relayed into the brain, activating microglia.

**Spatial Analysis:**  
Immunohistochemistry confirmed increased CD68+ microglia in the parenchyma, perivascular, and meningeal compartments in COVID-19 brains.

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
No direct genetic or demographic modifiers (e.g., APOE genotype) were reported as drivers of microglial activation in this cohort, but the study population was older adults (55–91 years).

Microglial activation in severe COVID-19 is strongly associated with neuroinflammatory signatures and shares features with microglial states in neurodegenerative diseases, suggesting a potential mechanism for acute and possibly long-term neurological symptoms. The absence of direct viral neuroinvasion supports a model where peripheral inflammation, relayed via the choroid plexus and brain barriers, drives microglial activation. These findings imply that microglial states may serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets for COVID-19-related neurological dysfunction, though causality remains to be established. <keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial activation may contribute to synaptic dysfunction and cognitive symptoms in COVID-19, but this is based on associative data.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study provides strong evidence that severe COVID-19 induces a robust, disease-associated microglial state in the human brain, with both transcriptomic and morphological validation. The COVID-19-associated microglia share partial overlap with DAM/ARM/Mic1 states from neurodegenerative disease, but also display unique features, notably RIPK1 upregulation, suggesting a distinct inflammatory response. The findings highlight the importance of peripheral-to-central immune signaling (via the choroid plexus and brain barriers) in driving microglial activation, rather than direct viral infection of the CNS.

Open questions include whether these microglial states persist in long COVID, their precise functional consequences (e.g., synaptic pruning, neurotoxicity), and whether they are reversible. The study’s findings align with, but also extend, existing microglial classification schemes by identifying a COVID-19-specific activation profile. The explicit comparison with neurodegenerative microglial states, and the authors’ discussion of both overlap and divergence, is a key strength. Future work should address the temporal dynamics of microglial activation, its relationship to clinical outcomes, and the potential for targeting microglia in COVID-19-related neurological disease.

<contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>  
The authors explicitly state that while COVID-19 microglia overlap with DAM/ARM/Mic1, they are not identical, particularly in the upregulation of RIPK1 and other inflammatory genes, marking a departure from prior neurodegenerative models.

# summary for Zhang 2024 (microglia)

1) **Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

Single-cell RNA sequencing of perihematomal edema (PHE) tissue after intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) revealed **12 distinct microglial subtypes**, including homeostatic, proinflammatory, disease-associated (DAM-like), and proliferative states. Most microglial subclusters rapidly adopted a proinflammatory phenotype, with downregulation of homeostatic markers (P2RY12, CX3CR1) and upregulation of inflammatory mediators (IL1B, CCL2, HLA genes). The SPP1/osteopontin pathway, predominantly produced by microglia, emerged as a key axis for microglia-microglia and microglia-monocyte communication, especially via the OPN–CD44 interaction. Microglial state transitions and SPP1 signaling were dynamically modulated across the first 48 hours post-ICH.

Microglia are the principal orchestrators of the proinflammatory immune microenvironment in PHE after ICH, rapidly transitioning from homeostatic to inflammatory and DAM-like states. The SPP1/osteopontin axis, produced by microglia, may regulate both microglial activation and crosstalk with infiltrating monocytes via CD44, potentially shaping the immune milieu and influencing secondary injury. These findings suggest that targeting microglial SPP1 signaling or specific proinflammatory subtypes could be a therapeutic strategy for modulating neuroinflammation and improving outcomes after ICH. However, all mechanistic insights are associative, as the study is cross-sectional and based on transcriptional profiling.
</clinical>

---

3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study provides a comprehensive single-cell atlas of microglial heterogeneity in human PHE after ICH, revealing a rapid loss of homeostatic microglia and expansion of proinflammatory and DAM-like states. The identification of the SPP1/osteopontin axis as a dominant mediator of microglial self-communication and microglia–monocyte interaction is a major advance, highlighting a potential therapeutic target. The microglial subtypes described here partially overlap with, but also extend beyond, previously reported DAM and homeostatic states in neurodegeneration, suggesting context-specific activation programs in acute brain injury. Open questions include the functional consequences of SPP1 signaling, the reversibility of proinflammatory states, and the potential for targeting specific microglial subtypes or ligand-receptor interactions to modulate PHE progression. The study’s findings are largely consistent with prior models of microglial activation in acute CNS injury, with no explicit contradictions discussed by the authors. Future work should address the causal roles of these subtypes and pathways using in vivo models and longitudinal sampling.

In contrast, human AD microglia show a distinct IRF8-driven reactive phenotype, with upregulation of "homeostatic" genes (TMEM119, P2RY12, CX3CR1) and IRF8, and only partial overlap with DAM. TREM2 R47H and R62H variants in humans are associated with a blunted microglial activation signature. <keyFinding priority='1'>TREM2 genotype is a key modulator of microglial activation in both species, but the transcriptional response is species-specific.</keyFinding>

**Detailed Summary**

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Disease Association**

In the 5XFAD mouse model, microglia expand significantly in response to Aβ pathology, with this microgliosis being partially TREM2-dependent at early disease stages. At 7 months, the microglial cluster is much larger in 5XFAD than in Trem2−/− 5XFAD or wild-type controls. By 15 months, the difference in microglial numbers between 5XFAD and Trem2−/− 5XFAD diminishes, suggesting that aging can compensate for the delayed microgliosis seen with TREM2 deficiency. <keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial expansion is robustly associated with Aβ pathology and is modulated by TREM2, especially at early stages.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Microglial Subtype Identification and Characterization (Mouse)**

Re-clustering of microglia from 7-month-old mice revealed four sub-clusters. Sub-cluster 1 is highly enriched in 5XFAD, less so in Trem2−/− 5XFAD, and nearly absent in wild-type and Trem2−/− mice. This sub-cluster expresses canonical DAM genes: Cst7, Csf1, Apoe, Trem2, Lpl, Lilrb4a, MHC-I (H2-d1), MHC-II (Cd74), and cathepsins. Homeostatic genes (P2ry12, Selplg, Tmem119, Cx3cr1) are downregulated in this state. <keyFinding priority='1'>The DAM state is both Aβ- and TREM2-dependent, and is characterized by upregulation of phagocytic, lipid metabolism, and immune activation genes.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

At 15 months, a similar DAM-enriched sub-cluster is present only in 5XFAD mice, confirming the persistence of this state with disease progression. <keyFinding priority='2'>DAM persists into late-stage pathology, but TREM2-deficiency delays rather than abolishes its emergence.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment (Mouse)**

DAM microglia upregulate genes involved in phagocytosis, lipid metabolism, antigen presentation, and immune response. Pathway analysis highlights immune activation as the dominant process. Proteomic validation confirms upregulation of DAM markers at the protein level, with reduced abundance in Trem2−/− and R47H-5XFAD mice. <keyFinding priority='2'>Proteomic and transcriptomic data are concordant for DAM markers, supporting the robustness of the DAM signature.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Microglial Subtype Identification and Characterization (Human)**

In human AD cortex, microglia do not recapitulate the mouse DAM signature. Instead, microglia upregulate "homeostatic" genes (TMEM119, P2RY12, CX3CR1), IRF8, and other genes such as SORL1, A2M, and CHI3L1. Only a subset of DAM homologues (MHCII, TREM2, CD68, APOE) are upregulated; others (CST7, GPNMB, LPL) are not detected or are downregulated. <keyFinding priority='1'>Human AD microglia adopt an IRF8-driven reactive phenotype, distinct from mouse DAM, with increased expression of homeostatic and injury-associated genes.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Re-clustering of human microglia identifies seven sub-clusters. Sub-cluster Micro0 is enriched for AD-reactive genes and is upregulated in both aged controls and AD, suggesting a continuum with aging. <keyFinding priority='2'>The AD-associated microglial signature in humans is present in aging and is further upregulated in disease, but is not identical to mouse DAM.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators & Metrics: TREM2 Variants**

AD patients carrying TREM2 R62H or R47H variants show reduced expression of AD-reactive microglial genes (TREM2, HLA-DRA, CHI3L1, IRF8, AIF1) compared to common variant carriers, with the effect being more pronounced for R47H. The number of microglia is similar, but their activation state is blunted. <keyFinding priority='1'>TREM2 hypomorphic variants attenuate the microglial activation signature in human AD, mirroring the TREM2-dependence of DAM in mice.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Gene Regulatory Networks**

IRF8 is identified as a key transcriptional driver of the human AD microglial phenotype. Overexpression of Irf8 in mouse microglia upregulates P2RY12, while Irf8−/− cells show reduced P2RY12, supporting a causal role for IRF8 in this signature. <keyFinding priority='2'>IRF8 is a major regulator of the human AD microglial response.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**

Immunofluorescence and IHC confirm increased IRF8, Iba1, CD68, and HLA-DR in AD microglia, supporting the snRNA-seq findings. <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**

The human AD microglial signature overlaps with aging-associated changes, and sub-clusters upregulated in AD are also upregulated in aged controls. <keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial activation in human AD may represent an amplification of aging-associated programs rather than a distinct DAM-like state.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Contradictions/Departures from Prior Data**

The authors explicitly note a "remarkable discordance" between the mouse DAM signature and the human AD microglial response, with the latter lacking many canonical DAM markers and instead resembling an IRF8-driven injury response. <contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag> The paper discusses that while mouse DAM is TREM2-dependent and marked by loss of homeostatic genes, human AD microglia upregulate homeostatic markers and IRF8, and only partially overlap with DAM.

</findings>

<clinical>
Microglia in AD are strongly implicated in disease pathogenesis, with TREM2 acting as a critical modulator of their activation. In mice, TREM2 is required for the full DAM response, which is associated with plaque compaction and neuroprotection. In humans, microglial activation is less DAM-like and more reminiscent of an IRF8-driven injury response, with upregulation of homeostatic and injury-associated genes. TREM2 hypomorphic variants (R47H, R62H) blunt this activation, suggesting a conserved requirement for TREM2 in microglial response, but with species-specific transcriptional outcomes. These findings suggest that microglial activation states may serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets, but also highlight the need for caution in extrapolating mouse DAM biology to human AD. <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications**

This study highlights the complexity and species-specificity of microglial responses in AD. The DAM paradigm, well-established in mouse models, does not fully translate to human disease, where microglia instead show an IRF8-driven, partially homeostatic, and injury-associated signature. The role of TREM2 as a modulator of microglial activation is conserved, but the downstream transcriptional programs diverge. Open questions include the functional consequences of the human IRF8-driven microglial state, its relationship to neurodegeneration, and whether targeting TREM2 or IRF8 pathways could modulate disease progression in humans. The findings also underscore the need for human-specific models and caution in interpreting mouse microglial biology as directly applicable to human AD. <keyFinding priority='1'>The divergence between mouse and human microglial responses is a critical consideration for translational research and therapeutic development.</keyFinding> <contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag> (Explicitly discussed: mouse DAM ≠ human AD microglia; IRF8-driven signature in human AD.)

# summary for Zhu 2024 (microglia)

**Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This study (Zhu et al., 2024, Science Translational Medicine) used single-nucleus RNA sequencing and proteomics to profile the prefrontal cortex in late-stage Parkinson’s disease (PD) and controls. Microglia showed a significant increase in number and the highest number of differentially expressed genes among glial cells, with upregulation of activation and immune response pathways (notably FOS, STAT3, RUNX1, BCL6, IL4R, JAK3). No distinct microglial subtypes were reported, but microglial activation was prominent and associated with neuroinflammation. LRRK2, a PD risk gene, was highly expressed in microglia, suggesting genetic modulation of microglial states in PD.

</metadata>

<methods>
This study performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on the prefrontal cortex (Brodmann area 9) from six late-stage PD patients and six age- and sex-matched controls, profiling 77,384 nuclei. Proteomic analysis was conducted on the same tissue samples. Cell type identification was based on canonical markers, and validation included RNAscope in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry.
</methods>

<findings>
Microglia (MG, ITGAM+) were robustly identified as one of eight major brain cell types. The study did not report further subdivision of microglia into distinct subtypes or states (e.g., homeostatic vs. disease-associated microglia) based on clustering or marker gene expression. Instead, microglia were analyzed as a single population with respect to disease-associated transcriptional changes.

**Cell Type Proportions:**  
Microglia were increased in PD brains compared to controls (PD: 3684 nuclei; controls: 1699 nuclei; P = 0.09), a trend validated by RNAscope quantification of IBA1- or C1QA-expressing cells. This suggests a mild but consistent expansion or activation of microglia in the PD prefrontal cortex.  
<keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial numbers are increased in PD, supporting a role for neuroinflammation.</keyFinding>  
<confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>  
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression:**  
Microglia exhibited the highest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among glial cells (178 upregulated, 135 downregulated in PD vs. controls).  
- **Upregulated genes:** FOS, STAT3, RUNX1 (myeloid cell differentiation); BCL6, IL4R, JAK3 (regulation of hemopoiesis); NFKBIZ, IL15, NFKBID (glycolytic process/activation).
- **Downregulated genes:** LPAR1, ANXA4, AXL (phospholipid binding); CXADR, SELPLG, AXL (virus receptor activity).  
<keyFinding priority='1'>Microglia in PD show strong upregulation of immune activation and differentiation pathways, with prominent DEGs including FOS, STAT3, RUNX1, BCL6, IL4R, and JAK3.</keyFinding>  
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>  
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Pathway Enrichment:**  
Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that upregulated pathways in microglia were related to myeloid cell differentiation, regulation of hemopoiesis, and glycolytic process—hallmarks of microglial activation in neurodegeneration. Downregulated pathways were limited, mainly involving phospholipid binding and virus receptor activity, suggesting a shift toward a more active, pro-inflammatory state rather than suppression of homeostatic functions.  
<keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial activation in PD is characterized by enhanced differentiation and metabolic pathways, consistent with a pro-inflammatory phenotype.</keyFinding>  
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>  
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  
The study did not identify or report distinct microglial subtypes (e.g., homeostatic, disease-associated, or intermediate states) within the PD or control samples. All microglia were analyzed as a single cluster, and no marker gene sets or functional annotations for microglial subclusters were provided.  
<keyFinding priority='3'>No microglial subtypes or state transitions were defined in this dataset; microglia were treated as a single, transcriptionally responsive population.</keyFinding>  
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>  
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Modulators & Metrics:**  
LRRK2, a major PD risk gene, was highly expressed in microglia and oligodendrocyte precursor cells, consistent with its known role in monocyte/microglial biology and PD risk. The study did not report microglial activation scores or detailed morphology metrics, but the increased proportion and activation signature suggest a disease-associated shift.  
<keyFinding priority='1'>LRRK2 is highly expressed in microglia in PD, supporting a genetic contribution to microglial activation.</keyFinding>  
<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>  
<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Gene Regulatory Networks:**  
Upregulation of transcription factors such as STAT3 and RUNX1 in microglia points to altered gene regulatory networks driving activation and differentiation.

**Cell-Cell Communication:**  
CellPhoneDB analysis indicated altered cell-cell communication in PD, with a general decrease in interactions across all cell types. Specific microglia-neuron or microglia-astrocyte ligand-receptor pairs were not highlighted as major findings, but the overall pattern supports increased neuroinflammation and reduced homeostatic cross-talk.

**Spatial Analysis:**  
Validation of increased microglial numbers and activation was performed using RNAscope in situ hybridization for IBA1 and C1QA, confirming snRNA-seq findings at the tissue level.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
No pseudotime or trajectory analyses were reported for microglia, and no evidence for stage-specific microglial transitions was presented.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  
LRRK2 expression in microglia links genetic risk to observed activation states. No eQTL or multi-omic integration specific to microglia was reported.

</findings>

<clinical>
Microglia in PD prefrontal cortex are increased in number and display a robust activation signature, with upregulation of immune differentiation and inflammatory pathways. The high expression of LRRK2 in microglia suggests that genetic risk factors may directly modulate microglial activation in PD. These findings reinforce the concept that microglial-mediated neuroinflammation is a key feature of PD pathogenesis in the cortex, potentially contributing to neuronal vulnerability and disease progression. While the study does not define microglial subtypes, the strong activation profile and genetic associations highlight microglia as potential therapeutic targets for modulating neuroinflammation in PD.
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study provides strong evidence that microglia in the PD prefrontal cortex are numerically increased and transcriptionally activated, with upregulation of immune response and differentiation pathways. The lack of reported microglial subtypes or state transitions is a notable limitation, as recent literature in Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative conditions has identified disease-associated microglial (DAM) states and intermediate phenotypes. The high expression of LRRK2 in microglia aligns with known genetic risk and supports the relevance of microglial biology to PD pathogenesis. Future research should focus on higher-resolution profiling to determine whether distinct microglial subtypes or activation trajectories exist in PD, as well as functional studies to clarify the causal role of microglial activation in neuronal degeneration. The findings are consistent with, but do not contradict, prior models of microglial involvement in PD; rather, they extend these models by providing human cortical data and genetic context. The absence of microglial subtype resolution may reflect technical or sample size limitations, and further studies using larger cohorts or spatial transcriptomics may reveal additional heterogeneity relevant to disease mechanisms and therapeutic targeting.

# summary for Zou 2024 (microglia)

**Quick Reference**

This study identifies a distinct microglial subpopulation, Mic_PTPRG, that is expanded in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) brains and communicates with neurons via the PTPRG-CNTN4 axis. Mic_PTPRG is characterized by high PTPRG expression and is implicated in regulating neuronal mitophagy and death through upregulation of the m6A methyltransferase VIRMA in neurons. The abundance of Mic_PTPRG increases with AD progression and is validated in both human and mouse models, with evidence for direct PTPRG–VIRMA interaction. <keyFinding priority='1'>Mic_PTPRG is a disease-associated microglial subtype that may drive neuronal vulnerability in AD via PTPRG-mediated signaling.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>

**Detailed Summary**

<metadata>
- Donghua Zou et al., 2024, Pharmacological Research 201:107098
- Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
</metadata>

<methods>
The study integrates single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) from 85 AD and 83 control human samples (multiple cortical regions, hippocampus, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells) with spatial transcriptomics from coronal brain sections of 6 AppNL-G-F AD mice and 6 controls. Key findings are validated by immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation in wild-type and 5×FAD mice. 
</methods>

<findings>
The authors systematically dissect microglial heterogeneity in AD and identify 20 microglial subpopulations. Among these, the Mic_PTPRG subpopulation is defined by high expression of **PTPRG** (protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor type G). This subtype is robustly increased in abundance in AD brains compared to controls, as shown by both scRNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics. <keyFinding priority='1'>Mic_PTPRG is a disease-associated microglial subtype with increased abundance in AD.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Defining markers and characteristics of Mic_PTPRG:**
- **Marker genes:** PTPRG (upregulated), with additional enrichment for genes involved in mitochondrial DNA replication and autophagic cell death pathways.
- **Functional signature:** Pathway enrichment analysis reveals Mic_PTPRG is associated with regulation of mitochondrial DNA replication, autophagic cell death, and neurodegeneration-related signaling.
- **Classification:** Disease-associated microglial state.
- **Proportion:** Quantitatively increased in AD brains (see Fig. 5D), with a trajectory analysis placing Mic_PTPRG at the terminal end of microglial differentiation in AD (Fig. 5F,G), suggesting a late-stage or reactive phenotype.

**Spatial and morphological validation:** 
- Spatial transcriptomics confirms increased PTPRG expression in microglia in AD mouse brains (Fig. 5C).
- Immunofluorescence in 5×FAD mice shows PTPRG protein is enriched at microglial processes, especially in regions with amyloid pathology (Fig. 8B).

**Cell-cell communication and disease mechanism:**
- Mic_PTPRG microglia interact with specific neuronal subpopulations (ExNeu_PRKN_VIRMA and InNeu_PRKN_VIRMA) via the PTPRG–CNTN4 ligand-receptor axis (Fig. 6A,B).
- This interaction is proposed to induce PTPRG expression in neurons, which in turn upregulates the m6A methyltransferase VIRMA, leading to suppression of PRKN (Parkin) translation and impaired mitophagy.
- The study provides evidence for direct physical interaction between PTPRG and VIRMA in mouse brain lysates (immunoprecipitation, Fig. 8C).

**Disease progression and modulators:**
- The abundance of Mic_PTPRG increases with AD progression, as shown by pseudotime analysis.
- No explicit mention of genetic risk factors (e.g., APOE) modulating Mic_PTPRG in this study.
- Other microglial subtypes (Mic_MT.RNR2_LNCAROD, Mic_FOXP1, Mic_GRID2) are also increased in AD, but Mic_PTPRG is the most prominent and mechanistically linked to neuronal death.

**Gene regulatory networks and cell-cell communication:**
- The PTPRG–CNTN4 axis is highlighted as a key ligand-receptor pair mediating microglia-neuron cross-talk.
- No specific transcription factors are reported as master regulators of Mic_PTPRG.

**Contradictions:** 
- The authors do not report explicit contradictions with prior microglial subtype models but note that the Mic_PTPRG–VIRMA–PRKN axis represents a novel mechanism for microglia-driven neuronal death in AD. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
The study implicates Mic_PTPRG microglia as active drivers of neuronal vulnerability in AD by modulating neuronal mitophagy through PTPRG-mediated upregulation of VIRMA and subsequent suppression of PRKN translation. This pathway may contribute to the accumulation of damaged mitochondria and neuronal death, providing a mechanistic link between microglial activation and neurodegeneration in AD. <keyFinding priority='1'>Targeting the PTPRG–VIRMA–PRKN axis in microglia-neuron communication may represent a novel therapeutic strategy for AD.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> (as causality is inferred from cross-sectional and in vitro data).
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications**

This study expands the landscape of microglial heterogeneity in AD by identifying Mic_PTPRG as a disease-associated, functionally distinct subpopulation that is increased in human and mouse AD brains. The mechanistic link between Mic_PTPRG and neuronal death—via the PTPRG–VIRMA–PRKN axis—suggests a previously unrecognized pathway by which microglia may actively drive neurodegeneration. The findings align with, but extend beyond, established models of disease-associated microglia (DAM) by implicating a specific ligand-receptor interaction and downstream epitranscriptomic regulation in neurons.

Open questions include whether Mic_PTPRG overlaps with previously described DAM or other microglial activation states, and whether its expansion is modulated by genetic risk factors such as APOE. The study’s reliance on cross-sectional and computational analyses, with limited in vivo functional validation, means that further work is needed to establish causality and therapeutic potential. Nonetheless, the identification of Mic_PTPRG and its signaling axis provides a strong rationale for future studies targeting microglia-neuron communication in AD.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> (no explicit conflicts with prior microglial subtype models are discussed by the authors).
