I. Microglia in Alzheimer’s Disease  
    A. Genetic regulation as a driver of disease susceptibility  
        1. Microglia-specific cis-eQTL at APOE (rs2288911) elevates APOE only in microglia and associates with cerebral amyloid angiopathy, independent of ε4 (Fujita 2024)  
        2. Microglia display the greatest number of AD GWAS colocalizations among all brain cell types (Fujita 2024)  
        3. Sixteen AD risk genes (e.g., BIN1, EPHA1-AS1, SORL1) harbor microglia-specific eQTLs; 143 genes show microglia-restricted regulation, underpinning cell-type enrichment of AD heritability (Hoffman 2024)  
    B. Disease-associated microglial subpopulations shaped by host genetics  
        1. Mic.12 (APOE⁺ GPNMB⁺) lipid-associated microglia rise with age and precede Aβ deposition (Green 2024)  
        2. Mic.13 (APOE⁺ GPNMB⁺ TREM2⁺ SPP1⁺) is enriched in APOE ε4 carriers, mediates Aβ-driven tau spread, and correlates with cognitive decline (Green 2024)  
        3. Mic-stress (MECP2⁺) is highly enriched in autosomal-dominant AD and late sporadic AD, representing a unique stress-response state (Brase 2023; Brase 2021)  
        4. Mic-reduced homeostatic state is expanded in TREM2 reduced-activation variant carriers (Brase 2023)  
        5. Mic-proinflammatory (IL1B⁺ C3↑ C5↓) is dose-dependently enriched in MS4A rs1582763-A resilience allele carriers (Brase 2023)  
    C. Inflammatory and signaling programs during progression  
        1. PTPRG up-regulation (log2FC 1.52) and p38-MAPK cascade activation mark microglial inflammatory response in AD cortex (Hoffman 2023)  
        2. TYROBP-centered defense response genes and microglial expansion correlate with late-stage pathology severity (Mathys 2023)  
        3. Module M12 (APOE, SORL1, ADAM10, SNCA) specifically up-regulated in late-stage hippocampal/entorhinal microglia (Davila-Velderrain 2021)  
        4. Mic_PTPRG subtype communicates with neurons via PTPRG–CNTN4, inducing neuronal VIRMA and suppressing PRKN-dependent mitophagy (Zou 2024)  
    D. Regional and methodological heterogeneity  
        1. snRNA-seq of entorhinal/frontal cortex fails to detect DAM markers because of nuclear RNA loss (Leng 2021)  
        2. Temporal cortex microglia show minimal AD-related perturbation compared with vascular/astrocytic changes (İş 2024)  
        3. Microglial eQTL overlap with prior bulk datasets is modest, underscoring need for cell-type-resolved approaches (Fujita 2024)  

II. Microglia in Parkinson’s Disease  
    A. Emergent and vulnerable microglial states  
        1. GPNMB⁺ SULT1C2⁺ DAM-like microglia are proportionally increased in PD/LBD SNpc (Kamath 2022)  
        2. TH-enriched Microglia1 (TH⁺ HSP90AA1⁺ HSPA8⁺) is selectively depleted in PD and exhibits unfolded-protein-response and oxidative-stress up-regulation (Martirosyan 2024)  
        3. IL1B⁺ HSP90AA1⁺/GPNMB⁺ activated microglia expand and adopt amoeboid morphology in idiopathic PD midbrain (Smajic 2021)  
    B. Genetic modulation  
        1. LRRK2 risk enrichment highest in activated microglia of PD substantia nigra (Smajic 2021)  
        2. P2RY12 PD risk allele is selectively expressed in pro-inflammatory Microglia2 (Martirosyan 2024)  
    C. Core pathways  
        1. DAM2-like markers (GPNMB, SPP1, C1Q) and cytokine signaling (IL1B) define PD-associated microglia (Kamath 2022; Smajic 2021)  
        2. Unfolded protein response/oxidative stress signature accompanies loss of TH⁺ microglia (Martirosyan 2024)  

III. Microglia in Multiple Sclerosis  
    A. Rim-localized chronic-active microglia  
        1. Microglia accumulate at chronic-active lesion rims, up-regulating CD163, FTL, APOE, APP, C1QB/C, SPP1, GPNMB (Lerma-Martin 2024)  
        2. Complement, iron handling, and phagocytosis programs dominate rim microglial transcriptomes (Lerma-Martin 2024; Schirmer 2019)  
    B. Phagocytosing microglia/macrophages  
        1. Presence of myelin transcripts (PLP1, MBP, ST18) within microglia confirms active myelin debris uptake; validated in vitro (Schirmer 2019)  
        2. Lipid-catabolic enzymes (ASAH1, ACSL1, DPYD) support degradation of ingested myelin (Schirmer 2019)  
    C. Lesion-stage heterogeneity  
        1. Homeostatic P2RY12⁺ microglia are depleted in lesions; chronic-inactive lesions harbor remodeling TGFB1⁺ LRRK2⁺ microglia (Lerma-Martin 2024)  
    D. Spatially restricted cross-talk  
        1. HMGB1 (astrocyte) → CD163/TLR2 (microglia) and CD14 (microglia) → ITGB1 (astrocyte/endothelium) interactions enriched at lesion rim (Lerma-Martin 2024)  

IV. Microglia in ALS and Frontotemporal Dementia  
    A. Limited yet significant transcriptional activation  
        1. Microglia show fewer DEGs than astrocytes; MYO1E up-regulated with concordant promoter H3K27ac in C9-ALS (Li 2023)  
        2. Gene expression changes are largely non-overlapping between C9-ALS and C9-FTD, indicating disease-specific microglial responses (Li 2023)  
    B. Partial loss of homeostasis  
        1. Down-regulation of CSF1R/CX3CR1 and partial induction of DAM markers (GNAS, IL18, SPP1) denote incompletely activated microglia in cortex (Pineda 2024)  
    C. Epigenetic underpinning  
        1. Strong correlation between microglial DEGs and promoter H3K27ac (Spearman r 0.51) implies epigenetic control of microglial activation (Li 2023)  

V. Microglia in Psychiatric and Neurodevelopmental Disorders  
    A. Sex- and diagnosis-specific remodeling  
        1. In female MDD, Mic1 microglia up-regulate neuronal/ion-channel genes (CX3CR1, TMEM119) and down-regulate interferon/IL-10 pathways, accounting for 38 % of female DEGs (Matira 2023)  
        2. PTSD microglia activate inflammatory pathways, whereas MDD microglia suppress ribosomal/metabolic genes and immune signaling (Daskalakis 2024)  
    B. Autism spectrum disorder  
        1. Microglia up-regulate activation and developmental regulators (PTGS2, CDC37) with DEG burden correlating with ADI-R clinical severity (Velmeshev 2019)  
    C. Disorders with minimal microglial involvement  
        1. Schizophrenia cortex shows negligible microglial DEGs and stable homeostatic state (Reiner 2021; Ruzicka 2020)  
        2. Rett syndrome brains exhibit no MECP2-dependent microglial transcriptional changes (Renthal 2018)  

VI. Acute/Systemic Responses and Baseline Variability  
    A. Severe COVID-19  
        1. C3-high Mic-2 microglia expand in PFC, up-regulating Fc-phagocytosis and immune pathways under IRF8, ATF5, SPI1, TAL1 control; trajectory from homeostatic to highly activated (Fullard 2021)  
    B. Inter-individual heterogeneity in health  
        1. In adult cortex, inflammatory genes (CCL3, CCL4, SOCS3) vary widely between donors; donor identity eclipses age/sex/disease in explaining microglial variance (Johansen 2023)  

VII. Cross-Disorder Microglial Themes  
    A. Conserved DAM2-like program: GPNMB, SPP1, C1Q up-regulated across AD, PD, MS, COVID-19 (Brase 2023; Kamath 2022; Lerma-Martin 2024; Fullard 2021)  
    B. Metabolic stress responses: lipid-handling Mic.12/13 in AD and iron-laden CD163⁺ microglia at MS rims reflect shared metabolic adaptations (Green 2024; Lerma-Martin 2024)  
    C. Genetic modulation of states: TREM2 (Brase 2023; Sayed 2021), MS4A (Brase 2023), P2RY12 (Martirosyan 2024) define distinct activation vs homeostatic phenotypes  
    D. Technical caveats: nuclear RNA profiling underrepresents cytoplasmic DAM markers, leading to false negatives (Leng 2021; Pineda 2024)  
    E. Sex and ancestry effects: female-biased microglial transcriptional shifts in MDD (Matira 2023); non-European ancestry enhances detection of microglia-specific AD eQTLs (Hoffman 2024)  

VIII. Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions  
    A. Functional validation of microglial eQTL effects (e.g., APOE rs2288911 on CAA pathogenesis) (Fujita 2024)  
    B. Temporal sequencing of lipid-associated Mic.12 → Mic.13 transition and its causal link to amyloid-tau spread (Green 2024)  
    C. Mechanistic role of Mic-stress in autosomal-dominant vs sporadic AD (Brase 2023)  
    D. Determinants of regional heterogeneity—absence of DAM signatures in temporal cortex despite pathology (İş 2024)  
    E. Clarifying protective vs pathogenic roles of GPNMB/SPP1-rich DAM2 microglia across diseases (Kamath 2022; Lerma-Martin 2024)  
    F. Hormonal and epigenetic mechanisms driving female-specific microglial phenotypes in depression (Matira 2023)  
    G. Expansion of multi-ancestry cohorts to map diverse microglial regulatory variants influencing AD risk (Hoffman 2024)  
    H. Therapeutic exploration  
        1. AKT inhibition reverses R47H-TREM2 MG4 state and rescues synaptic loss (Sayed 2021)  
        2. Targeting PTPRG–VIRMA–PRKN microglia-neuron signaling axis to prevent neuronal mitophagy failure (Zou 2024)  
        3. Modulating complement/iron pathways in rim microglia to curb chronic lesion expansion in MS (Lerma-Martin 2024)

    B. Complement-Linked Synaptic Pruning Deficits  
        1. m6 complement-rich (C1QA/B/C^+, IL4R^+) microglia are selectively reduced in AD cortex, implying impaired pruning (Lau2020)  
        2. Loss of complement homeostatic microglia accompanies plaque-associated AD1 expansion (Gerrits2021)  

    C. Tau-Associated Oxidative and Interferon States  
        1. Redox Mic.3 (DDIT4, SLC2A3) and interferon Mic.4 (IFI44L, MX2) proportions rise with tau burden and cognitive decline (Cain2023)  
        2. Mic.3/Mic.4 mediate 2.7–7 % of the tau–cognition link in mediation models (Cain2023)  

    D. Pathology-Specific Programs: Amyloid vs. Tau  
        1. Amyloid regions enrich AD1-microglia, whereas tau-rich cortex harbours GRID2^+ AD2-microglia with neurotrophic gene sets (Gerrits2021)  
        2. MG2 disease-associated microglia cluster near amyloid plaques, while MG1 homeostatic cells are depleted (Miyoshi2024)  

    E. Metabolic Reprogramming  
        1. Microglia up-regulate glycolysis genes (GAPDH, BNIP3L) and down-regulate viral-response genes in high plaque/NFT regions (Mathys2024)  
        2. Lipid-droplet gene modules (ACSL1, DPYD, APOE) surge at intermediate Braak stages, especially in APOE ε4 homozygotes (Lee2024)  

    F. Genetic and Transcriptional Drivers  
        1. Early activation of RUNX1, IKZF1, NFATC2, MAF regulons orchestrates the DAM programme (Gabito2024)  
        2. SPI1/PU.1 motif variability rises in activated microglia but targets are paradoxically down-regulated (Morabito2021)  
        3. AD microglial modules are enriched for GWAS loci including APOE, TREM2, INPP5D, PLCG2 (Mathys2019, Grubman2019)  
        4. AD1-microglia genes strongly overlap AD risk variants (Gerrits2021)  

    G. Heterogeneity and Technical Considerations

II. Microglia in Parkinson’s Disease  
    A. Age-to-Disease Trajectory  
        1. Combined pseudopathogenesis score shows step-wise shift from P2RY12^+ homeostatic to IL15^+/CLEC2B^+ aging microglia and a small TREM2-independent DAM state (Adams2024)  

    B. Immune/Autophagy Activation with Genetic Risk  
        1. SN microglia up-regulate FOS, STAT3, RUNX1, LRRK2, JAK3 and other immune-autophagy genes in late PD (Zhu2024)  
        2. Microglial cis-regulatory elements are significantly enriched for PD GWAS variants targeting SNCA, LRRK2, VPS13C, GAK (Lee2023)  
        3. Risk alleles disrupt ZNF148 motifs, lowering target-gene expression in PD donors (Lee2023)  

    C. Region-Specific Divergence  
        1. Temporal-cortex Micro1 shows broad down-regulation of immune, DNA-repair and stress-response pathways despite minimal microgliosis (Shwab2024)  
        2. Substantia nigra exhibits significant microglial expansion and activation (Zhu2024)  

    D. Regulatory Re-wiring  
        1. Aging-to-PD trajectory involves extensive reallocations of peak-gene associations without global ATAC shifts (Adams2024)  
        2. Microglial regulatory disruption explains a major fraction of PD heritability second only to oligodendrocytes (Lee2023)  

III. Microglia in Multiple Sclerosis  
    A. Reactive Shift in White-Matter Lesions  
        1. Homeostatic P2RY12^+ Micro_A/B decrease, while GPNMB^+/MITF^+ Micro_D and IL1B^+/CCL3^+ Micro_E rise in active/chronic lesions (Macnair2024)  

    B. Stress-Responsive States  
        1. HSPA6/HIF1A Micro_C signifies chaperone-mediated stress and is enriched in active lesions (Macnair2024)  

    C. Patient-Specific Pathology  
        1. Microglial activation profiles cluster patients rather than lesion types, indicating individual-specific immune programmes (Macnair2024)

    C. Sex & Genetic Modifiers  
        1. Mechanistic basis of female-biased microglial activation remains unknown (Mathys2019, Miyoshi2024)  
        2. Functional validation of disease-risk variants within microglial enhancers via genome editing is needed (Lee2023)  

    D. Cross-Species Translation  
        1. Human microglia lack full TREM2-dependent DAM signature seen in mice; species differences need mechanistic dissection (Morabito2021)
