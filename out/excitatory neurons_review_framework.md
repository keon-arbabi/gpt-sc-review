    E. Cilium / axoneme and axonal-maintenance pathway down-regulation links ALS/FTLD and PD projection neurons (Pineda 2024; Lee 2023)  

XI. Knowledge Gaps and Future Research Directions  
    A. Alzheimer’s disease – mechanisms initiating APOE/MHC-I co-expression and functional impact of cohesin up-regulation remain unresolved (Brase 2021; Mathys 2023)  
    B. Parkinson’s disease – temporal progression from SNCA over-expression in Exc5 to cortical degeneration and the in-vivo effect of GWAS-motif disruptions require longitudinal validation (Shwab 2024; Lee 2023)  
    C. Schizophrenia – causal links between upper-layer neuron expansion, TF-module activity, and cortical network dysfunction are undetermined (Batiuk 2022; Ruzicka 2024)  
    D. ALS/FTLD – functional role of cilium/axoneme gene loss in VAT1L+ neurons and adaptive vs. maladaptive nature of proteostasis up-regulation in L2/3 neurons need testing (Pineda 2024; Li 2023)  
    E. Multiple Sclerosis – direct evidence that glutamate-receptor up-regulation drives excitotoxic neuron loss in grey-matter lesions is lacking (Macnair 2024)  
    F. Major depressive disorder – mechanisms underlying male-specific deep-layer excitatory suppression and behavioural correlates remain to be defined (Maitra 2023)  
    G. Neurodevelopment – regulators of puberty-timed maturation of paralaminar excitatory neurons and their contribution to neurodevelopmental disorders are unknown (Sorrells 2019)  
    H. Technical limitations – under-sampling of excitatory neurons in depletion or midbrain protocols and high donor variability in deep layers necessitate improved nucleus-isolation and spatial-omics strategies (Gerrits 2021; Adams 2024; Johansen 2023)
