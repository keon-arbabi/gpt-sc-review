DAMs are marked by upregulation of inflammatory and plaque-induced genes (e.g., IL1B, CSF1R, C1QA/B, APOE), and their emergence is strongly associated with early AD pathology and APOE4 genotype enrichment. Homeostatic and lipid-associated microglia are also distinguished, but DAMs are the primary disease-associated state.\n\n---\n\n**Detailed Summary (\u2248500 words)**\n\n<metadata>\nGabitto MI, Travaglini KJ, Rachleff VM, et al. (2024). \"Integrated multimodal cell atlas of Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\" *Nature Neuroscience* 27:2366\u20132383.  \nDisease focus: Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD)\n</metadata>\n\n<methods>\nThis study profiled the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) from 84 aged human donors (mean age 88), spanning the full spectrum of AD neuropathology, using single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq), snATAC-seq, multiome, and spatial transcriptomics (MERFISH). Donors were placed along a continuous pseudoprogression score (CPS) derived from quantitative neuropathology. Microglial subtypes were mapped to a curated BRAIN Initiative taxonomy and validated across modalities and independent datasets.\n</methods>\n\n<findings>\nMicroglia were comprehensively characterized, revealing both homeostatic and disease-associated subpopulations. The most salient change was a significant early increase in a disease-associated microglial (DAM) subtype, termed micro-PVM_3, as AD pathology progressed (<keyFinding priority='1'>DAMs (micro-PVM_3) increase early and robustly with AD severity, preceding exponential plaque/tangle accumulation</keyFinding>). This DAM state was replicated in independent datasets and aligns with previously described Mic.12/Mic.13 subtypes.\n\nDAMs are defined by upregulation of inflammatory and plaque-induced genes, including IL1B, CSF1R, STAB1, NINJ1, JAK3, IRF1/7, IFI16, FCGR1A/B, FCGR2A, FCGR3B, CD74, HLA-DRB5, and complement components C1QA/B. Notably, genes induced by A\u03b2 plaques (CSF1R, CTSC, C1QA/B, LY86, FCGR3A) are upregulated early, while others (CTSD, CTSS, LYZ, APOE) rise later in CPS (<keyFinding priority='1'>Early and late upregulation of inflammatory and plaque-induced genes in microglia, including APOE</keyFinding>). The DAM state is further characterized by increased expression of transcription factors RUNX1, IKZF1, NFATC2, and MAF, which are predicted to coregulate a network of 201 genes involved in inflammation and phagocytosis.\n\nHomeostatic microglia (micro-PVM_2) and proliferative/lipid-associated subtypes (micro-PVM_4) were also identified. Homeostatic microglia express canonical markers (e.g., P2RY12, TPT1), while lipid-associated microglia are marked by genes involved in lipid metabolism. However, only the DAM subtype showed a strong disease association (<keyFinding priority='2'>Homeostatic and lipid-associated microglia are present but do not increase with pathology</keyFinding>).\n\nSpatial and morphological validation was achieved through MERFISH and immunostaining, confirming the presence and localization of DAMs in affected cortical regions. The increase in DAMs was observed early in the CPS, before exponential plaque/tangle accumulation, and was consistent across MTG and prefrontal cortex datasets. The DAM increase was more pronounced in donors with the APOE4 allele, which was enriched in high-ADNC cases (<keyFinding priority='1'>APOE4 genotype is associated with higher DAM abundance</keyFinding>).\n\nGene regulatory network analysis using snATAC-seq revealed that the upregulated transcription factors (RUNX1, IKZF1, NFATC2, MAF) are specifically expressed in microglia and drive early DAM gene expression changes. Cell-cell communication analysis suggests that DAMs may interact with astrocytes and other glia via cytokine and complement signaling, but direct ligand-receptor pairs were not detailed.\n\nAging/disease trajectory modeling showed that DAMs emerge early, with their abundance plateauing as pathology accelerates. Homeostatic microglia decrease slightly, while other subtypes remain relatively stable. The DAM signature was robustly replicated in independent AD datasets, supporting its generalizability (<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>).\n\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nMicroglial DAMs are strongly associated with early AD pathology and may mediate inflammatory and phagocytic responses to amyloid and tau accumulation. The upregulation of APOE and complement genes in DAMs suggests a potential role in plaque clearance or propagation, but causality cannot be established from cross-sectional data. The early emergence of DAMs, particularly in APOE4 carriers, highlights their potential as biomarkers or therapeutic targets for early intervention in AD. However, whether DAM activation is protective or detrimental remains unresolved.\n</clinical>\n\n<technical>\nThe study used high-quality tissue and rigorous multi-modal validation, including spatial transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility, to confirm microglial subtype identities and dynamics. The DAM signature was consistent across technical platforms and replicated in external datasets, increasing confidence in the findings.\n</technical>\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications (\u2248100 words)**  \nThis study robustly identifies a disease-associated microglial (DAM) subtype as an early and consistent feature of AD progression, with a molecular signature aligning with established DAM/Mic.13 classifications. The strong association with APOE4 genotype and early pathology suggests DAMs may be a key mediator of neuroinflammation and plaque response. Open questions remain regarding the functional consequences of DAM activation\u2014whether they are neuroprotective, neurotoxic, or context-dependent\u2014and how their emergence interacts with other glial and neuronal changes. No major contradictions with prior DAM models are noted; rather, this work strengthens the consensus on DAMs as a core AD microglial phenotype.\n\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"
