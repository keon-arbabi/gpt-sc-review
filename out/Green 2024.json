Mic.12 is strongly age-associated and may promote amyloid-\u03b2 accumulation, while Mic.13, enriched in APOE \u03b54 carriers, mediates the effect of amyloid-\u03b2 on tau pathology and is linked to cognitive decline. Both subtypes are morphologically activated and validated by spatial and in situ methods.\n\n---\n\n**Detailed Summary (\u2248600 words)**\n\n<metadata>\nGilad Sahar Green et al., \"Cellular communities reveal trajectories of brain ageing and Alzheimer\u2019s disease,\" Nature 633, 19 September 2024.  \nDisease focus: Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) and brain aging.\n</metadata>\n\n<methods>\nSingle-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) was performed on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, BA9) tissue from 437 older ROSMAP participants, spanning the full spectrum of AD and aging. The study generated a cellular atlas of 1.65 million nuclei, identifying 95 subpopulations across all major brain cell types. Validation included bulk RNA-seq deconvolution (CelMod), single-molecule RNA FISH (smFISH), immunofluorescence, and spatial transcriptomics.\n</methods>\n\n<findings>\nThe microglial compartment was resolved into 16 subpopulations, with particular focus on two lipid-associated states: Mic.12 (APOE+GPNMB+CPM+) and Mic.13 (APOE+GPNMB+TREM2+PTPRG+SPP1+). Both subtypes express AD risk genes and are enriched for pathways related to foam cell differentiation, cholesterol storage, and lipid metabolism. <keyFinding priority='1'>Mic.12 and Mic.13 are the microglial subpopulations most strongly associated with AD endophenotypes\u2014amyloid-\u03b2 (A\u03b2) and tau burden, and cognitive decline\u2014across both discovery and replication cohorts.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nMic.12 is characterized by higher expression of endocytic vesicle regulation (PELI1/2), MHC class II genes (HLA-DRA), and is strongly associated with age (P=2.8\u00d710\u207b\u2075), suggesting an age-dependent dysfunction that may impair A\u03b2 clearance. <keyFinding priority='2'>Mic.12 abundance is positioned upstream of A\u03b2 accumulation in causal models, indicating it may contribute to early amyloid pathology in aging brains.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nMic.13, in contrast, is not age-associated but is enriched in APOE \u03b54 carriers and expresses additional AD risk genes (TREM2, ADAM10). It upregulates cell junction, adhesion, and ECM organization pathways (ADAM10, TGFBR1, SMAD3, PPARG), and genes involved in negative regulation of immune processes. <keyFinding priority='1'>Causal mediation analysis places Mic.13 downstream of A\u03b2 and upstream of tau pathology and cognitive decline, mediating 32% of the A\u03b2\u2013tau association and 62% of its effect on cognitive decline via tau.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> Mic.13 is also linked to the DAM2 microglial signature and is the primary driver of morphologically defined microglial activation (PAM stage III).\n\nBoth Mic.12 and Mic.13 were validated as distinct populations by smFISH in independent DLPFC samples, using CPM and TPRG1 as markers, respectively. Their proportions correlated with tau pathology (AT8 staining) and showed reduced compactness (less ramified, more activated morphology) compared to other microglia. Mic.12 also showed increased eccentricity. <keyFinding priority='2'>Morphological and spatial transcriptomics analyses confirmed the co-localization and activation status of these subtypes in AD brains.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nTrajectory modeling (BEYOND) revealed two divergent aging paths: a progression-to-AD (prAD) trajectory, marked by increasing Mic.12 and Mic.13 abundance, and an alternative brain aging (ABA) trajectory, where these subtypes remain low. Along the prAD trajectory, Mic.12 increases early (age-driven), followed by Mic.13 (APOE \u03b54-driven), then stress-responsive astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Homeostatic microglia (e.g., Mic.2\u20135, CX3CR1+) decrease along both trajectories, contrasting with the disease-associated expansion of Mic.12/13. <keyFinding priority='2'>Mic.13 and stress-responsive astrocytes (Ast.10) are spatially co-localized in prAD brains, suggesting coordinated multicellular responses.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n<clinical>\nThe study proposes that Mic.12 may initiate amyloid pathology in an age-dependent manner, while Mic.13, modulated by APOE \u03b54, mediates the transition from amyloid to tau pathology and cognitive decline. Both subtypes represent potential therapeutic targets: Mic.12 for early intervention to prevent A\u03b2 accumulation, and Mic.13 for halting tau propagation and neurodegeneration. Their distinct marker profiles (CPM for Mic.12, TPRG1/SPP1/TREM2 for Mic.13) may serve as biomarkers for disease stage or trajectory. The findings support a model where microglial subpopulations act in sequence, with homeostatic states giving way to lipid-associated, disease-driving phenotypes in AD.\n</clinical>\n\n<technical>\nFindings are robust, replicated in independent bulk RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics datasets, and validated by in situ and morphological analyses. Causal inferences are based on cross-sectional data and mediation modeling, warranting cautious interpretation regarding temporal sequence.\n</technical>\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications (\u2248100 words)**  \nThis study refines the classification of disease-associated microglia in human aging and AD, distinguishing two lipid-associated subtypes with distinct temporal, genetic, and functional profiles. The sequential involvement of Mic.12 (age-driven) and Mic.13 (APOE \u03b54-driven) in AD pathology provides actionable hypotheses for targeted intervention and biomarker development. The alignment of Mic.13 with DAM2 and activated morphologies supports its relevance to established microglial activation frameworks. Open questions remain regarding the precise mechanisms by which these subtypes influence proteinopathy and whether similar trajectories are present in other brain regions or neurodegenerative diseases. No major contradictions with prior models are noted; rather, this work extends and clarifies existing paradigms."
