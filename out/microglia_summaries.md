# summary for Gabitto 2024 (microglia)

<quickReference>
This large-scale, multimodal atlas of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression in human middle temporal gyrus (MTG) identifies a single, robust disease-associated microglial subtype (Micro-PVM_3) that expands early in AD, marked by upregulation of inflammatory and plaque-induced genes (e.g., IL1B, CSF1R, C1QA/B, APOE). This microglial state is strongly associated with increasing pathology and is enriched in APOE4 carriers and females, mirroring known AD risk factors. The findings are validated across spatial, transcriptomic, and chromatin modalities, and replicated in multiple independent AD cohorts.

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq), snATAC-seq, and spatial transcriptomics (MERFISH) were performed on MTG tissue from 84 aged donors spanning the full spectrum of AD neuropathology. Donors were ordered along a continuous pseudoprogression score (CPS) derived from quantitative neuropathology. Cell types were mapped to a high-resolution BRAIN Initiative reference taxonomy, with additional subtypes/states identified in disease. Validation included spatial mapping and cross-cohort replication in Brodmann area 9 (A9) and 10 additional public AD datasets.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and Disease Association:**  
A single microglial subtype, Micro-PVM_3, is robustly and specifically increased in abundance early in AD progression, as measured by CPS, cognitive status, and AD neuropathological change (ADNC). This expansion is observed in both MTG and A9, and is replicated in multiple independent AD snRNA-seq datasets. The increase is more pronounced in APOE4 carriers and females, consistent with known AD risk factors. <keyFinding priority='1'>Micro-PVM_3 is the principal disease-associated microglial state in human AD cortex, expanding early and tracking with pathology and risk alleles.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Microglial Subtype Characterization:**  
- **Micro-PVM_3 (DAM-like):**  
  - **Defining markers:** Upregulation of inflammatory cytokines (IL1B, JAK3), complement (C1QA, C1QB), MHC-II (CD74, HLA-DRB5), Fc receptors (FCGR1A/B, FCGR2A, FCGR3B), interferon response genes (IRF1, IRF7, IFI16), and plaque-induced genes (CSF1R, CTSC, LYZ, APOE).
  - **Functional signature:** Strongly pro-inflammatory, with gene sets enriched for inflammatory response, interferon signaling, and phagocytosis. Early upregulation of genes previously shown to be induced by amyloid plaques in AD.
  - **Classification:** Disease-associated microglia (DAM), distinct from homeostatic, proliferative, and lipid-associated microglial states.
  - **Disease association:** Increases early in CPS, before exponential amyloid/tau accumulation and cognitive decline. Expansion is robust across regions (MTG, A9), modalities (snRNA-seq, snATAC-seq, MERFISH), and independent datasets. <keyFinding priority='1'>Micro-PVM_3 expansion is an early, conserved hallmark of AD progression.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
  - **Morphological/spatial validation:** Spatial transcriptomics confirms increased abundance and localization of Micro-PVM_3 in AD tissue.
  - **Genetic/demographic modulators:** Expansion is more pronounced in APOE4 carriers and females. <keyFinding priority='1'>APOE4 genotype and female sex are strong modulators of Micro-PVM_3 expansion.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
  - **Gene regulatory networks:** snATAC-seq identifies upregulation of TFs RUNX1, IKZF1, NFATC2, and MAF, which regulate inflammatory and plaque-induced genes in Micro-PVM_3.

- **Other microglial subtypes:**  
  - **Micro-PVM_4:** Lipid-associated microglia, increased in late AD but less robustly than Micro-PVM_3.
  - **Micro-PVM_1, Micro-PVM_2, Micro-PVM_2_1, Micro-PVM_2_3:** Homeostatic and proliferative microglia, not significantly changed in AD.
  - **Monocytes, Lymphocytes:** Minor populations, not disease-associated.

**Temporal Dynamics:**  
Micro-PVM_3 increases early in the CPS trajectory, preceding exponential amyloid/tau accumulation and major neuronal loss. Its expansion is among the earliest cellular changes detected in AD progression.

**Spatial Analysis:**  
MERFISH spatial transcriptomics confirms increased Micro-PVM_3 abundance and localization in AD cortex, validating snRNA-seq findings.

**Replication and Contradictions:**  
Micro-PVM_3 (and its analogs in other taxonomies, e.g., Mic.12/Mic.13 in Green et al. 2023) is consistently increased in AD across all major single-nucleus studies. No contradictory microglial subtypes were found to decrease in AD; minor differences in oligodendrocyte responses were noted across datasets but not for microglia. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Cell-Cell Communication:**  
Micro-PVM_3 upregulates ligands and receptors involved in inflammatory signaling, complement activation, and phagocytosis, suggesting enhanced cross-talk with astrocytes and other glia.

**Integration with Genetics:**  
Micro-PVM_3 upregulates APOE, the strongest genetic risk factor for AD, and its expansion is enriched in APOE4 carriers.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  
Micro-PVM_3 expansion is an early event, preceding major neuronal loss and cognitive decline, and persists throughout disease progression.
</findings>

<clinical>
Microglia, specifically the Micro-PVM_3 (DAM-like) subtype, are strongly implicated as early responders in AD pathogenesis, expanding before overt neuronal loss and cognitive impairment. Their transcriptional profile suggests a central role in mediating inflammatory and phagocytic responses to amyloid and tau pathology. The strong association with APOE4 and female sex highlights potential mechanisms for genetic and demographic risk. These findings reinforce microglial activation as a candidate therapeutic target and suggest that Micro-PVM_3 markers may serve as early biomarkers of AD progression. <keyFinding priority='1'>Micro-PVM_3 expansion may mediate early neuroinflammatory responses and represents a promising target for intervention and biomarker development in AD.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</clinical>
</detailedSummary>

<researchImplications>
This study establishes Micro-PVM_3 as the principal, conserved disease-associated microglial state in human AD cortex, expanding early and robustly in response to pathology and genetic risk. Open questions include the precise causal role of Micro-PVM_3 in neurodegeneration—whether it is protective, detrimental, or context-dependent—and the mechanisms by which APOE4 and sex modulate its expansion. The molecular signature of Micro-PVM_3 aligns with previously described DAM/ARM states, supporting the emerging consensus on microglial heterogeneity in AD. However, the study’s high-resolution taxonomy and multimodal validation provide unprecedented confidence in the timing and specificity of this response. Future work should dissect the functional consequences of Micro-PVM_3 activation, its interactions with other glia and neurons, and its potential as a therapeutic target. No major contradictions with prior models were identified for microglia, but minor differences in oligodendrocyte responses across datasets warrant further investigation. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, BA9) tissue from 437 older individuals (ROSMAP cohort), yielding 1.65 million nuclei. Cell subpopulations were defined by unsupervised clustering and marker gene analysis. Validation included bulk RNA-seq deconvolution (CelMod), single-molecule RNA FISH (smFISH), immunohistochemistry, and spatial transcriptomics.

<findings>
This study provides a comprehensive atlas of microglial heterogeneity in the aged and AD cortex, identifying 16 microglial subpopulations with distinct molecular and functional profiles. The most critical findings center on two lipid-associated microglial subpopulations—Mic.12 and Mic.13—that are strongly implicated in AD pathogenesis.

**Microglial Subtypes and Their Characterization:**

- **Mic.1**: Proliferative microglia (TOP2A+), enriched for cell cycle and DNA replication genes. No direct disease association highlighted.
- **Mic.2–5**: Surveilling microglia (CX3CR1+, P2RY12+), representing homeostatic states. These subtypes are relatively stable across individuals and serve as the baseline microglial population.
- **Mic.6–8**: Reacting microglia (TMEM163+, IL4R+), involved in glial cell migration and phagocytosis.
- **Mic.9–10**: Enhanced-redox microglia (FLT1+, FTH1+, FTL+), with upregulation of ferric iron binding and redox pathways.
- **Mic.11**: Stress response microglia (HSPH1+, DNAJB1+, NLRP1+), expressing heat shock and inflammasome genes.
- **Mic.14**: Interferon response microglia (IFI6+), enriched for interferon signaling and viral response.
- **Mic.15**: Inflammatory microglia (CCL3/4+, NFKB1+, IL1B+, CD83+), expressing pro-inflammatory and stress response genes.
- **Mic.16**: SERPINE1-expressing microglia, associated with cell migration and adhesion.
- **Mic.12 (CPM+)**: Lipid-associated microglia, expressing APOE, GPNMB, and CPM. Enriched for genes involved in foam cell differentiation, cholesterol storage, and lipid metabolism. Mic.12 is strongly associated with increased amyloid-β (Aβ) burden and is positioned upstream of Aβ accumulation in the AD cascade. This subtype is also age-associated, suggesting a role in age-dependent microglial dysfunction and impaired Aβ clearance. <keyFinding priority='1'>Mic.12 is a major lipid-associated microglial subtype, strongly linked to Aβ pathology and aging.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **Mic.13 (PTPRG+, SPP1+, TREM2+)**: Lipid-associated, disease-activated microglia, expressing APOE, GPNMB, TREM2, SPP1, and PTPRG. Upregulated pathways include cell junction/adhesion, ECM organization, negative regulation of immune processes, and AD risk genes (ADAM10, TREM2). Mic.13 is strongly associated with both Aβ and tau pathology, and with cognitive decline. Causal modeling places Mic.13 downstream of Aβ and upstream of tau, mediating the effect of Aβ on tau accumulation and subsequent cognitive decline. Mic.13 is enriched in APOE ε4 carriers but not associated with age. <keyFinding priority='1'>Mic.13 is a key disease-associated microglial subtype, mediating the link between Aβ and tau pathology, and is enriched in APOE ε4 carriers.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Validation and Morphological Features:**
- smFISH and immunohistochemistry in independent samples confirmed that Mic.12 (CPM+) and Mic.13 (TPRG1+) are distinct microglial populations, both associated with increased tau pathology.
- Both subtypes show reduced compactness (less ramified, more amoeboid morphology), consistent with activated microglia. Mic.12 also shows increased eccentricity (elongation).
- Mic.13 abundance correlates with the proportion of morphologically activated microglia (PAM score), and this association is stronger than for Mic.12.

**Disease Trajectories and Community Dynamics:**
- Using the BEYOND framework, the study identifies two major trajectories of brain aging: one leading to AD (prAD) and another representing alternative brain aging (ABA).
- Along the prAD trajectory, Mic.12 and Mic.13 increase early, followed by stress-response glia and other disease-associated subtypes. These changes are coordinated within multicellular communities.
- Mic.12 is positioned as an early driver of Aβ pathology, while Mic.13 mediates the transition from Aβ to tau pathology and cognitive decline.

**Modulators & Metrics:**
- Mic.12 is associated with age, suggesting age-dependent vulnerability.
- Mic.13 is associated with APOE ε4 genotype, but not age.
- Both subtypes are enriched for AD GWAS risk genes (APOE, GPNMB, TREM2, ADAM10).
- Quantitative activation scores (PAM) and morphological features support their activated status.

**Gene Regulatory Networks & Cell-Cell Communication:**
- Mic.13 upregulates ADAM10, TREM2, SMAD3, PPARG, and other regulators involved in immune modulation and ECM remodeling.
- Both Mic.12 and Mic.13 upregulate genes involved in phagocytosis and exocytosis.

**Spatial Analysis:**
- Spatial transcriptomics and smFISH confirm the co-localization and distinct spatial distribution of Mic.12 and Mic.13 in AD brains.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**
- Mic.12 abundance increases with age and precedes Aβ accumulation.
- Mic.13 abundance increases with Aβ and mediates the progression to tau pathology and cognitive decline.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**
- Both Mic.12 and Mic.13 are enriched for AD risk genes and signatures from human and mouse models (DAM2, Aβ-associated microglia).

Microglia, particularly the Mic.12 and Mic.13 subtypes, play distinct and sequential roles in the pathogenesis of AD. Mic.12 may contribute to age-dependent failure of Aβ clearance, while Mic.13 mediates the transition from Aβ to tau pathology and cognitive decline, especially in APOE ε4 carriers. These findings suggest that targeting Mic.12 could be relevant for early intervention to prevent Aβ accumulation, whereas targeting Mic.13 may be critical for halting tau pathology and cognitive decline. Both subtypes are potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets, and their abundance or activation state could inform patient stratification and treatment timing. <keyFinding priority='1'>The identification of Mic.12 and Mic.13 as sequential, functionally distinct microglial drivers of AD pathology provides a mechanistic framework for stage-specific therapeutic targeting.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Research Implications (≈150 words):**

This study establishes a robust framework for dissecting microglial heterogeneity and its role in AD progression. The identification of Mic.12 and Mic.13 as sequential, functionally distinct, and genetically modulated microglial subtypes provides actionable hypotheses for therapeutic intervention—Mic.12 as a target for early, age-related Aβ pathology, and Mic.13 for halting tau pathology and cognitive decline, particularly in APOE ε4 carriers. The findings align with, but refine, previous DAM and Aβ-associated microglia models by providing causal and temporal placement within the AD cascade. Open questions remain regarding the precise molecular triggers for Mic.12-to-Mic.13 transitions, the reversibility of these states, and their relevance in other brain regions or neurodegenerative diseases.

Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on 1.35 million nuclei from 283 post-mortem samples across six brain regions (entorhinal cortex [EC], hippocampus [HC], anterior thalamus [TH], angular gyrus [AG], midtemporal cortex [MT], prefrontal cortex [PFC]) from 48 individuals (26 AD, 22 non-AD). Cell type annotation, gene module discovery (scdemon), and region/pathology-specific differential expression analyses were conducted. Validation included in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry.

**Microglial Subtypes and Gene Modules**  
The study identified several microglial subtypes and gene expression modules using a decorrelated module network approach (scdemon). Key microglial modules included:
- **Identity modules**: Markers for canonical microglia (e.g., P2RY12, TMEM119), T cells, macrophages, and cycling microglia (MKI67+).

Microglial DEGs associated with neuritic plaque and neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) burden showed:

Microglia showed the highest enrichment for AD GWAS risk genes across all regions, especially in TPT1+ microglia and macrophages in HC, TH, and AG. Region-specific expression of GWAS genes included PLCG2 (EC), APOE and SORL1 (TH), and MS4A4A (MT).

**Microglial Subtype Dynamics and Disease Progression**  
No evidence was found for dramatic expansion or depletion of microglial subtypes in AD, nor for the emergence of a unique disease-associated microglial (DAM) state as described in some mouse models. Instead, microglial responses were characterized by quantitative shifts in gene module activity (e.g., glycolysis, interferon, MHC-II) rather than discrete subtype transitions.

Microglia in the aged human brain exhibit regionally tuned, graded transcriptional responses to AD pathology, rather than discrete disease-associated subtypes. The upregulation of glycolytic and immune response modules in microglia is strongly associated with amyloid plaque burden, particularly in allocortical and limbic regions. Microglia are the principal cell type expressing AD risk genes, supporting their central role in disease pathogenesis. However, the lack of a discrete DAM state in human AD suggests that therapeutic strategies targeting microglial activation should consider the continuous, region-specific nature of their response. Microglial metabolic adaptation (e.g., glycolysis) may represent a potential biomarker or therapeutic target for modulating neuroinflammation in AD.
</clinical>

<quickReference>
This study profiled microglia across six brain regions in 48 aged human brains with and without Alzheimer’s disease, revealing that microglia do not form discrete disease-associated subtypes in AD. Instead, microglia show regionally tuned, graded upregulation of immune and metabolic gene modules—especially glycolysis and MHC-II pathways—in response to amyloid and tau pathology. Microglia are the principal cell type expressing AD GWAS risk genes, with some loci (e.g., PLCG2, APOE) showing region-specific expression. The microglial response is continuous and region-dependent, not a switch to a distinct DAM state as seen in mouse models.
</quickReference>

<researchImplications>
This work challenges the prevailing model—derived from mouse studies—of a discrete, disease-associated microglial (DAM) state in AD, instead supporting a model of continuous, regionally modulated microglial activation in the human brain. The strong enrichment of AD risk genes in microglia, and the region-specific expression of loci such as PLCG2 and APOE, reinforce the centrality of microglia in AD pathogenesis and suggest that regional context is critical for understanding genetic risk mechanisms. The upregulation of glycolytic and immune response modules in microglia in response to amyloid pathology highlights metabolic adaptation as a potential therapeutic target. Open questions include the functional consequences of these graded microglial responses for neuronal health and whether interventions can selectively modulate microglial metabolism or immune signaling in vulnerable brain regions. The absence of a discrete DAM state in human AD is in partial conflict with some prior mouse and human studies, underscoring the need for further cross-species and spatially resolved analyses.

**Conflict:** The lack of a DAM-like microglial state in human AD contrasts with findings from mouse models and some prior human studies, suggesting species or methodological differences in microglial activation signatures.

# summary for Olah 2020 (microglia)

**Quick Reference**

This study (Olah et al., 2020, Nat. Commun.) used single-cell RNA sequencing of live human microglia from cortex to define nine distinct microglial subtypes, including a cluster (cluster 7) enriched for antigen presentation genes (e.g., CD74, HLA-DRB1) that is reduced in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) tissue. Cluster 7 is also enriched for AD risk genes and is specifically diminished in frequency in AD, as validated by immunohistochemistry and independent single-nucleus RNA-seq data. Notably, cluster 7 is not associated with amyloid plaque proximity, and its reduction is not explained by changes in total microglial numbers.

**Pathway Enrichment and Disease Mechanisms**  
- Cluster 7 is enriched for antigen presentation pathways (MHC II, CD74), and its gene set overlaps with the murine DAM signature, but DAM genes are distributed across several human clusters.  
- Cluster 4 is enriched for interferon response pathways.  
- Clusters 5/6 are enriched for anti-inflammatory cytokine signaling.  
- Cluster 9 is enriched for cell cycle and proliferation pathways.

- CD74^high microglia (cluster 7) are not preferentially localized to amyloid plaques.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**  
- Cluster 7 is specifically reduced in frequency in AD, both by IHC and snRNA-seq mapping.  
- No evidence for expansion of proliferative microglia (cluster 9) in AD, in contrast to some mouse models.  
- Homeostatic clusters (1/2) are stable across disease states.

**Genetic and Multi-omic Integration**  
- Cluster 7 expresses higher levels of AD risk genes (e.g., TREM2).  
- No single cluster is uniquely enriched for all GWAS risk genes; cluster 4 expresses more MS risk genes.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
Cluster 7 microglia, defined by high CD74 and MHC II gene expression, are specifically reduced in AD cortex, suggesting a loss of antigen-presenting microglial function in disease. This reduction is not explained by loss of total microglia or proximity to amyloid plaques. The findings imply that microglial dysfunction in AD may involve selective depletion or alteration of specific subtypes rather than global activation or proliferation. Cluster 7’s enrichment for AD risk genes (e.g., TREM2) and its reduction in AD suggest potential as a biomarker or therapeutic target, but causality remains unproven due to cross-sectional design.
</clinical>

---

**Research Implications**

This study provides a high-resolution map of human microglial heterogeneity, revealing at least nine subtypes with distinct functional and disease associations. The identification of cluster 7 as an antigen-presenting, AD-associated microglial subtype that is specifically reduced in AD challenges the prevailing mouse-based DAM model, where disease-associated microglia often expand. The lack of proliferative microglial expansion in human AD also contrasts with some murine models. Open questions include the mechanisms driving the selective reduction of cluster 7 in AD, its functional consequences for antigen presentation and neuroinflammation, and whether similar subtypes exist in other brain regions or diseases. Future work should address longitudinal dynamics, causal relationships, and the potential for targeting cluster 7 microglia in AD therapy. The study’s subtypes partially align with known mouse microglial states (e.g., DAM, interferon-responsive), but with important differences in distribution and disease response, highlighting the need for human-specific models. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Disease focus: Schizophrenia
</metadata>

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) was performed on postmortem prefrontal cortex (PFC) tissue from 140 individuals (75 schizophrenia, 65 controls) across two independent cohorts (McLean, Mount Sinai). Multiplexed nuclear hashing enabled pooling and demultiplexing. Cell types were annotated using ACTIONet and curated marker genes. Differential expression (DE) analysis was performed per cell type and cohort, followed by meta-analysis. Validation included in situ hybridization, qPCR, and CUT&Tag for transcription factor binding.
</methods>

<findings>
**Cell Type Proportions and General Features**  
Microglia (Mic) were robustly identified as a major glial cell type in the human PFC, with annotation confirmed by high CSF1R expression. The study did not report significant changes in the overall proportion of microglia between schizophrenia and control groups, nor did it observe loss of microglial cells, consistent with the lack of cell loss seen in other glial types. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Microglial Subtypes and States**  
The paper does not provide a detailed breakdown of microglial subtypes or states (e.g., homeostatic vs. disease-associated microglia) as is common in neurodegeneration studies. Microglia are treated as a single population for the purposes of differential expression analysis. No mention is made of microglial activation markers (e.g., AIF1/IBA1, CD68, TMEM119) or of subpopulations such as DAM (disease-associated microglia) or homeostatic microglia. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Differential Gene Expression in Microglia**  
Microglia exhibited a modest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in schizophrenia compared to controls, with the majority of DEGs being downregulated. However, the number and magnitude of DEGs in microglia were substantially lower than in neuronal populations. The most prominent transcriptomic changes in schizophrenia were observed in excitatory neurons, with microglia showing only minor alterations. <keyFinding priority='2'>Microglia display limited transcriptional changes in schizophrenia, with no evidence for major disease-associated subtypes or activation states.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Pathway Enrichment and Functional Implications**  
Pathway enrichment analysis did not highlight microglia as a major contributor to the neurodevelopmental or synaptic themes that dominated schizophrenia DEGs. There was no significant enrichment of immune, inflammatory, or phagocytic pathways in microglial DEGs. Synaptic and neurodevelopmental pathways were primarily altered in neurons. <keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial DEGs do not converge on immune or synaptic pathways in schizophrenia, in contrast to findings in neurodegeneration.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Genetic and Host Modulators**  
There was no evidence that microglial DEGs were enriched for schizophrenia GWAS risk variants, nor were they linked to rare coding variants associated with schizophrenia. The strongest genetic associations were observed in excitatory neurons. No mention is made of demographic or host factors (age, sex, APOE, etc.) modulating microglial states or gene expression in this study. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Gene Regulatory Networks and Cell-Cell Communication**  
The study identified a core module of transcription factors (TFs) associated with neuronal DEGs and schizophrenia risk, but did not implicate microglia-specific TFs or regulatory networks. No microglia-specific ligand-receptor interactions or cell-cell communication pathways were highlighted as altered in schizophrenia. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**  
No spatial transcriptomics, immunostaining, or morphological validation of microglial subtypes or activation states was reported. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**  
No evidence was presented for age- or disease-stage–dependent transitions in microglial states, nor for pseudotime trajectories involving microglia. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**  
Microglial DEGs were not enriched for eQTLs or other genetic risk signals for schizophrenia. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
Microglia in the adult human PFC show minimal transcriptomic alteration in schizophrenia, with no evidence for disease-associated subtypes or activation states analogous to those seen in neurodegeneration. The lack of immune or inflammatory pathway enrichment in microglia suggests that, in contrast to Alzheimer’s disease or multiple sclerosis, microglial dysfunction is not a primary driver of schizophrenia pathophysiology in the adult cortex. These findings argue against microglia as a major therapeutic target or biomarker source for schizophrenia, at least in chronic adult disease. <keyFinding priority='2'>Microglia are not a major contributor to the molecular pathology of schizophrenia in the adult PFC.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

<metadata>
This study by Ruzicka et al. (2024, Science) presents a comprehensive single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) analysis of the human prefrontal cortex (PFC) in schizophrenia, leveraging two large, independent cohorts (McLean and Mount Sinai) and profiling 468,727 nuclei from 140 individuals. The primary aim was to resolve cell type–specific transcriptomic alterations associated with schizophrenia, with a particular focus on the relative contributions of neuronal and glial populations.
</metadata>

<methods>
The authors employed multiplexed snRNA-seq with nuclear hashing to minimize batch effects and maximize cell recovery per individual. Cell types were annotated using a combination of unsupervised clustering (ACTIONet) and curated marker genes, with microglia identified by high CSF1R expression. Differential expression analysis was performed per cell type and cohort, followed by meta-analysis. Validation included in situ hybridization for interneuron subtypes, qPCR for selected DEGs, and CUT&Tag for transcription factor binding in neuronal nuclei.

<findings>
Microglia were robustly identified as a major glial cell type in the PFC, with annotation confirmed by canonical markers (CSF1R). However, the study did not report any significant changes in the overall proportion of microglia between schizophrenia and control groups, nor was there evidence for microglial cell loss or proliferation. This finding is consistent with the lack of cell loss observed in other glial populations and suggests that microglial abundance is not altered in chronic schizophrenia. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Unlike recent studies in neurodegenerative diseases, where microglia often display distinct disease-associated subtypes (e.g., DAM, activated microglia), this study treated microglia as a single, relatively homogeneous population. No subclustering or identification of microglial subtypes or states (such as homeostatic vs. activated) was reported. The authors did not mention the expression of activation markers (e.g., AIF1/IBA1, CD68, TMEM119) or the presence of microglial states analogous to those described in Alzheimer’s disease or multiple sclerosis. <keyFinding priority='2'>Microglia in the adult PFC do not exhibit disease-associated subtypes or activation states in schizophrenia.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Genetic analyses revealed that microglial DEGs were not enriched for schizophrenia GWAS risk variants, nor were they linked to rare coding variants associated with schizophrenia.

**Research Implications (≈150 words):**

This study provides strong evidence that microglia in the adult human PFC do not exhibit the disease-associated subtypes or activation states commonly observed in neurodegenerative disorders. The absence of microglial activation or immune pathway enrichment in schizophrenia suggests that microglia are not a primary locus of disease pathology in chronic adult cases. This finding is consistent with prior bulk and single-cell studies that have failed to identify robust microglial involvement in schizophrenia, but contrasts with models of neuroinflammation in other brain disorders. Open questions remain regarding the role of microglia in early developmental stages of schizophrenia, during acute psychosis, or in response to environmental risk factors. Future studies with higher-resolution microglial subclustering, spatial transcriptomics, or examination of earlier disease stages may be needed to fully exclude microglial involvement. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Microglial Subtype Structure and Proportions**
The study identifies 12 transcriptionally distinct microglial clusters, robust across donors, regions, and diseases. Clusters 1, 2, and 3 are most abundant, with clusters 1/6 and 2/4/9 forming two major "families" separated by a central metabolic axis.

**Subtype Characterization (with marker genes and functional signatures):**

- **Cluster 1:** Largest cluster; upregulates ITPR2, SORL1, MEF2A, RUNX1, CELF1. Functionally associated with heterocyclic/nitrogen metabolism and transcriptional regulation. <keyFinding priority='1'>Enriched for AD and MS GWAS genes; positively associated with amyloid, tau, and cognitive decline in ROSMAP.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

- **Cluster 5:** Intermediate state (CX3CR1, QKI, MEF2A); associated with motility. <keyFinding priority='3'>Enriched for MS risk genes.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **Cluster 7:** Related to 1/6 family; less well characterized.
- **Cluster 8:** CXCR4^hi, SRGN^hi; upregulates interferon, IL4/10/13, chaperone, and stress-response pathways. <keyFinding priority='2'>Enriched in neuroinflammatory but not neurodegenerative disease genes; validated in situ and by MERFISH.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **Cluster 10:** CD74^hi, HLA-C^hi, CD74, CYBA; strong MHC class I/II and complement expression. <keyFinding priority='1'>Immunologically active, DAM2-enriched; validated in situ as a rare, morphologically distinct subset; can be induced by camptothecin.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **Cluster 11:** SPP1^hi, LGALS1^hi; DAM2^hi, lipid processing, beta-amyloid clearance. <keyFinding priority='1'>Human DAM2-like; enriched for AD/amyloid genes, rare in cortex, abundant in glioblastoma.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- **Cluster 12:** MKI67^hi, PCNA^hi; proliferative phenotype, oxidative phosphorylation. <keyFinding priority='3'>Minor population, increased in glioma.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Metabolic and Functional Axes**
A central metabolic divide separates clusters 1/6/7 (heterocyclic/nitrogen metabolism, disease-enriched) from clusters 2/4/9 (oxidative phosphorylation, homeostatic-active). Clusters 8/10/11 represent immune-activated and DAM-like axes.

**Disease and Genetic Associations**
- Clusters 1/6: Strong enrichment for AD, MS, PD, depression GWAS genes; positively associated with amyloid, tau, and clinical AD in ROSMAP. <keyFinding priority='1'>These subtypes are increased in AD cortex and correlate with cognitive decline.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
- Cluster 10: Enriched for MS and schizophrenia genes; complement pathway upregulation.
- Cluster 11: Enriched for DAM2 signature, amyloid clearance genes; rare in cortex, abundant in glioma.
- Cluster 8: Enriched for neuroinflammatory (not neurodegenerative) disease genes.

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**
RNAscope-immunofluorescence and MERFISH confirm the existence and spatial distribution of key subtypes (CD74^hi, CXCR4^hi, SPP1^hi, GPX1^hi). CD74^hi and SPP1^hi microglia are less ramified (activated morphology); CXCR4^hi cells are more ramified.

**Modulators & Metrics**
Subtype proportions are modulated by disease, region, and genetic risk (e.g., APOE, MS GWAS loci). Quantitative activation and morphology scores (e.g., compactness, eccentricity) distinguish subtypes.

**Cell-Cell Communication**
Clusters 10/11 upregulate MHC and complement genes, suggesting enhanced antigen presentation and immune crosstalk.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**
Pseudotime and machine learning analyses suggest nonlinear, branching trajectories from homeostatic to disease-associated states, with intermediate and proliferative branches.

**Model System and Chemical Recapitulation**
iPSC-derived microglia and xenograft models recapitulate much of the in vivo heterogeneity. Chemical perturbation screens identify camptothecin as a tool compound that downregulates cluster 1/6 (disease-enriched) and upregulates cluster 10 (CD74^hi) signatures in vitro.
</findings>

<clinical>
Microglial subtypes 1/6 are strongly associated with AD and MS risk and pathology, suggesting these states may contribute to neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. Cluster 10 (CD74^hi) represents a rare, immunologically active state that can be pharmacologically induced and may have therapeutic potential for shifting microglial populations away from disease-associated states. Cluster 11 (DAM2^hi) is implicated in amyloid clearance and is abundant in glioma, suggesting a role in tumor-associated microglial activation. The resource provides a framework for biomarker development and targeted microglial modulation in neurological disease, but causal roles remain to be experimentally validated.
</clinical>

<researchImplications>
This study establishes a robust, cross-disease reference for human microglial heterogeneity, enabling annotation of external datasets and model systems. Open questions include the causal roles of specific subtypes in disease progression, the mechanisms driving transitions between homeostatic and disease-associated states, and the impact of genetic and environmental modulators. The identification of pharmacologically inducible subtypes (e.g., CD74^hi/cluster 10) offers a path for therapeutic microglial modulation. The subtypes and marker genes largely align with, but also refine, prior DAM and homeostatic classifications, highlighting the complexity and plasticity of human microglia. No major contradictions with previous models are noted, but the rarity of DAM2-like states in human cortex contrasts with their prominence in mouse models, suggesting species and disease-stage differences.
