# summary for Gabitto 2024 (microglia)

**Quick Reference (≈100 words)**

This large-scale, multimodal atlas of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression in the human middle temporal gyrus (MTG) identifies a disease-associated microglial subtype (Micro-PVM_3) that increases early in AD, marked by upregulation of inflammatory and plaque-induced genes (e.g., IL1B, CSF1R, C1QA/B, APOE). This microglial activation is evident before major neuronal loss and is strongly associated with increasing pathology and APOE4 genotype. The study robustly validates these findings across spatial transcriptomics, chromatin accessibility, and multiple independent datasets, highlighting early microglial activation as a key feature of AD progression.

<methods>
This study generated a comprehensive, multimodal atlas of the human MTG from 84 aged donors spanning the full spectrum of AD neuropathology. Single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq), single-nucleus ATAC-seq (snATAC-seq), multiome, and spatial transcriptomics (MERFISH) were performed, mapping 3.4 million nuclei to a refined taxonomy based on BRAIN Initiative references. Quantitative neuropathology was used to construct a continuous pseudoprogression score (CPS), enabling fine-grained modeling of disease severity. Findings were validated in an independent dataset from Brodmann area 9 (A9) in the same donors and replicated in 10 external snRNA-seq datasets (707 donors).

**Cell Type Proportions and Disease Association**

Microglia, annotated as "Micro-PVM" supertypes, showed a significant increase in relative abundance early in AD progression, as measured by the CPS. The disease-associated microglial subtype, Micro-PVM_3, was specifically enriched as pathology advanced, with effect sizes robust across both MTG and A9 regions and replicated in external datasets (notably Green et al. 2024). This increase was observed before the exponential rise in amyloid and tau pathology and prior to major neuronal loss, indicating microglial activation as an early event in AD.

**Microglial Subtype Characterization**

- **Micro-PVM_1**: Represents a microglial subtype with no significant change in abundance or disease association.
- **Micro-PVM_2**: Homeostatic microglia, expressing canonical markers (e.g., P2RY12, TMEM119), remained relatively stable in proportion.
- **Micro-PVM_2_1**: Proliferative microglia, marked by cell cycle genes (e.g., MKI67), showed minor changes.
- **Micro-PVM_2_3**: A minor subtype with unclear functional annotation.
- **Micro-PVM_3**: Disease-associated microglia (DAM), characterized by upregulation of inflammatory and phagocytic genes (IL1B, CSF1R, C1QA, C1QB, APOE, CTSC, FCGR1A/B, HLA-DRB5, IRF1/7, NINJ1, JAK3, STAB1, LYZ, cathepsins CTSD/CTSS). This subtype increased early in CPS and was spatially validated.
- **Micro-PVM_4**: Lipid-associated microglia, expressing genes involved in lipid metabolism, also increased but to a lesser extent.

<keyFinding priority='1'>Micro-PVM_3 (DAM) is defined by upregulation of inflammatory (IL1B, CSF1R), complement (C1QA/B), MHC-II (HLA-DRB5, CD74), Fc receptor (FCGR1A/B, FCGR2A, FCGR3B), and plaque-induced genes (APOE, CTSC, LYZ), with early and progressive increase in AD.</keyFinding>

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Functional and Pathway Signatures**

Micro-PVM_3 microglia showed strong enrichment for inflammatory, interferon response, complement, and phagocytic pathways. Early upregulation of genes homologous to those induced by amyloid plaques in AD mouse models (e.g., CSF1R, C1QA/B, CTSC, LY86, FCGR3A) was observed, with later upregulation of additional cathepsins and APOE. This suggests a staged activation program, with initial inflammatory and phagocytic activation followed by enhanced lipid metabolism and plaque response.

**Gene Regulatory Networks**

snATAC-seq data revealed that four transcription factors—RUNX1, IKZF1, NFATC2, and MAF—are upregulated early in microglia along the CPS and predicted to coregulate over 200 genes, including key inflammatory and plaque-induced genes. These TFs likely orchestrate the early microglial response in AD.

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

**Spatial and Morphological Validation**

Spatial transcriptomics (MERFISH) confirmed the increased abundance and laminar distribution of disease-associated microglia in affected cortical regions. The spatial patterning of microglial activation was consistent with regions of early amyloid and tau pathology.

**Modulators and Metrics**

The increase in Micro-PVM_3 was more pronounced in donors with the APOE4 allele, and in those with higher CPS (i.e., greater neuropathological burden). Sex differences were controlled for in modeling, but the study notes a higher prevalence of AD in females, consistent with epidemiology.

**Replication and Cross-Study Integration**

The microglial taxonomy and disease associations were highly concordant with those from Green et al. (2024), with Micro-PVM_3 corresponding to Mic.12/Mic.13 in that study. The same disease-associated microglial state was observed across multiple datasets, regions, and modalities, supporting its robustness.

**Cell-Cell Communication**

Microglial upregulation of complement and Fc receptor genes suggests enhanced interaction with synapses and other glial cells, potentially mediating synaptic pruning and neuroinflammation.

**Aging/Disease Trajectories**

Microglial activation (Micro-PVM_3) is an early event in the CPS trajectory, preceding major neuronal loss and coinciding with initial amyloid and tau accumulation. Later stages see further upregulation of lipid metabolism and phagocytic genes.

**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**

APOE4 genotype is enriched in high-ADNC cases and is associated with greater microglial activation. Chromatin accessibility data support the transcriptional activation of inflammatory pathways in microglia.

</findings>

<clinical>
Microglial activation, specifically the expansion of the Micro-PVM_3 (DAM) subtype, is a key early event in AD progression, preceding overt neuronal loss and correlating with pathology and APOE4 genotype. This state is marked by upregulation of genes involved in inflammation, complement activation, and phagocytosis, suggesting a role in early neuroinflammatory responses and possibly in synaptic pruning or plaque clearance. The robust, early, and reproducible nature of this microglial response highlights it as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target for early intervention in AD. However, causality cannot be definitively established from cross-sectional data.

**Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**

This study establishes Micro-PVM_3 (DAM) as a robust, reproducible, and early-activated microglial state in human AD, aligning with and extending prior DAM/DAM-like classifications from both human and mouse studies. The staged activation of inflammatory, complement, and phagocytic pathways, orchestrated by specific transcription factors, suggests a coordinated microglial response to early amyloid and tau pathology. Open questions remain regarding the precise functional consequences of this activation—whether it is protective, detrimental, or context-dependent—and how it interacts with genetic risk factors such as APOE4. The strong cross-study and cross-modal replication of this microglial state supports its relevance as a biomarker and therapeutic target. Future work should address the temporal dynamics of microglial activation in longitudinal samples, the reversibility of the DAM state, and the impact of modulating key regulators (e.g., RUNX1, CSF1R) on disease progression. No major contradictions with prior models are noted; rather, this study provides a unifying framework for microglial heterogeneity in AD.
