This microglial activation is evident before major neuronal loss and is strongly associated with increasing pathology and APOE4 genotype. The study robustly validates these findings across spatial transcriptomics, chromatin accessibility, and multiple independent datasets, highlighting early microglial activation as a key feature of AD progression.\n\n---\n\n**Detailed Summary (≈800–1000 words)**\n\n<metadata>\n- **Citation**: Gabitto MI, Travaglini KJ, Rachleff VM, et al. \"Integrated multimodal cell atlas of Alzheimer’s disease.\" Nature Neuroscience, 27:2366–2383, 2024. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-024-01774-5\n- **Disease focus**: Alzheimer’s disease (AD)\n</metadata>\n\n<methods>\nThis study generated a comprehensive, multimodal atlas of the human MTG from 84 aged donors spanning the full spectrum of AD neuropathology.

Quantitative neuropathology was used to construct a continuous pseudoprogression score (CPS), enabling fine-grained modeling of disease severity.
