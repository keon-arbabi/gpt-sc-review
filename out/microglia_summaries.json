    "summary": "Quick Reference\nA large-scale single-nucleus RNA-seq study of aged human neocortex (n=424) identified 899 microglial eGenes and revealed a microglia-specific cis-eQTL at the APOE locus (rs2288911), which increases APOE expression in microglia and is associated with cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) but not classic Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology, independent of APOEε4. Microglial eQTLs were often unique to this cell type, and microglia harbored the most AD GWAS colocalizations among all cell types.

The number of eGenes detected was proportional to cell type abundance, but the slope for eGene discovery was steeper among subtypes, suggesting greater regulatory diversity at the subtype level. <keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial eQTL discovery was robust despite their relative rarity, but less than for neurons.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Microglial Subtypes and eQTL Specificity**\nThe study identified several microglial subtypes (e.g., Mic.2, Mic.3, Mic.4, etc.), but the main focus was on eQTL effects rather than transcriptomic state characterization. Many eGenes were unique to microglia or to specific microglial subtypes, not detected in bulk or other cell types. <keyFinding priority='1'>A substantial fraction of eGenes were only detected at the microglial subtype level, highlighting the importance of fine-grained analysis.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**APOE Microglia-Specific eQTL**\nA novel cis-eQTL at the APOE locus (rs2288911) was identified as microglia-specific: this SNP increased APOE expression only in microglia, not in astrocytes or other cell types, despite APOE being expressed in multiple cell types. <keyFinding priority='1'>The rs2288911 variant is associated with increased APOE expression in microglia, but not with classic AD pathology (amyloid plaques or tau tangles); instead, it is strongly associated with increased CAA burden, independent of APOEε4 status.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n- The effect of rs2288911 on CAA persisted after adjusting for APOEε4 and showed no interaction with APOEε4, indicating an independent mechanism.\n- Chromatin data revealed that rs2288911 lies in a microglia-specific enhancer region physically interacting with the APOE promoter, supporting cell-type specificity.\n\n**Microglial eQTLs and Disease GWAS Colocalization**\nMicroglia harbored the largest number of AD GWAS colocalizations among all cell types, including known loci (e.g., BIN1) and several novel candidates. <keyFinding priority='1'>Microglial eQTLs showed the strongest overlap with AD risk loci, reinforcing microglia as a key cell type in AD genetic susceptibility.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Differential Gene Expression and Pathways**\nWhile the study’s primary focus was eQTL mapping, it confirmed that microglial eGenes are enriched for immune and lipid metabolism pathways, consistent with known microglial biology in AD. <keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial eGenes are functionally linked to immune response and lipid processing, with APOE as a central node.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Validation and Replication**\n- Microglial eQTLs showed modest overlap with previous bulk microglia eQTL studies, likely due to differences in methodology (nucleus vs. cytoplasmic RNA, brain region, sample size).\n- Many eQTLs were not detected in bulk tissue, highlighting the necessity of cell-type-resolved approaches.\n- Some eQTLs (e.g., MAPT) showed context-dependent directionality in iPSC-derived models, cautioning against direct extrapolation from in vitro systems.\n\n**Modulators & Metrics**\n- The APOE microglial eQTL effect is modulated by rs2288911 genotype, not by APOEε4.\n- No significant heritability was found for microglial subtype proportions (fQTLs), suggesting that genetic control of microglial abundance is limited in this dataset.\n\n**Cell-Cell Communication and Spatial Analysis**\n- Chromatin conformation data (PLAC-seq, ChIP-seq) confirmed microglia-specific enhancer-promoter interactions at the APOE locus.\n- No direct spatial transcriptomics or in situ validation of microglial subtypes was reported.\n\n**Aging/Disease Trajectories**\n- The study is cross-sectional; no direct pseudotime or trajectory analysis for microglia was presented.\n\n**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**\n- Integration with GWAS and chromatin data provided mechanistic insight into cell-type-specific genetic risk.\n\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nMicroglia are strongly implicated as mediators of AD genetic risk, with cell-type-specific eQTLs at key loci such as APOE and BIN1. The microglial APOE eQTL (rs2288911) is associated with CAA but not with classic AD pathology, suggesting that microglial APOE expression may drive vascular amyloid deposition and related clinical outcomes (e.g., microhemorrhages, ARIA risk in anti-amyloid therapy). These findings refine the mechanistic understanding of how genetic variation influences microglial function and disease risk, and may inform risk stratification and therapeutic targeting in AD and CAA. <keyFinding priority='1'>Microglial eQTLs, especially at APOE, may serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets for CAA and AD-related vascular pathology.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n</clinical>\n\nResearch Implications\n\nThis study establishes microglia as a central cell type for interpreting AD genetic risk, with many eQTLs and GWAS colocalizations unique to microglia or their subtypes. The discovery of a microglia-specific APOE eQTL (rs2288911) that is independent of APOEε4 and specifically associated with CAA, but not parenchymal amyloid or tau pathology, challenges the assumption that all APOE risk is mediated through classic AD mechanisms. This finding suggests distinct genetic and cellular pathways for vascular vs. parenchymal amyloid deposition. The study also demonstrates that many regulatory variants are only detectable at the cell subtype level, advocating for deeper, more granular single-cell studies in future research.\n\nOpen questions include the functional consequences of microglial APOE upregulation for CAA pathogenesis, the potential for targeting microglial APOE in therapy, and the need for spatial or morphological validation of microglial subtypes. The limited overlap with prior bulk microglia eQTL studies highlights the importance of methodological context. The authors note that while their findings align with the established role of microglia in AD, the identification of vascular-specific effects (CAA) represents a novel mechanistic insight. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

For microglia, the authors identified 13 subpopulations, with only three (notably m6) showing significant AD-associated changes. The m6 microglial subtype, marked by complement genes (C1QA, C1QB, C1QC) and cytokine receptors (IL4R, IL1RAP), was reduced in AD, suggesting impaired synaptic pruning. No strong genetic or demographic driver was highlighted for microglial subtypes.\n\n---\n\n**Detailed Summary**\n\n<metadata>\n- Lau, S.-F., Cao, H., Fu, A.K.Y., & Ip, N.Y. (2020).

Microglia were further subdivided into 13 transcriptomic subpopulations. However, only three subpopulations (m1, m6, m7) contributed to AD-associated transcriptomic changes, with the most notable being m6.\n\nThe m6 microglial subpopulation was characterized by high expression of complement genes (C1QA, C1QB, C1QC) and cytokine receptors (IL4R, IL1RAP). This subtype is implicated in synaptic pruning and cytokine response. In AD samples, the proportion of m6 microglia was reduced compared to controls. The authors interpret this as a loss of a microglial population important for normal synaptic pruning, potentially leading to imbalanced complement signaling and aberrant synaptic elimination in AD. <keyFinding priority='1'>The reduction of m6 microglia (C1QA/B/C+, IL4R+, IL1RAP+) is a key AD-associated change, suggesting impaired complement-mediated synaptic pruning.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nOther microglial subpopulations (m1, m7) also contributed to transcriptomic changes, but the paper does not provide detailed marker gene lists or functional annotations for these subtypes. The overall number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in microglia was moderate (340 DEGs: 111 up, 229 down in AD vs. control). Pathway analysis linked microglial DEGs to immune system processes, cytokine response, and membrane organization, but did not highlight strong disease-associated activation or DAM-like states as seen in some other studies.\n\nNo significant changes in total microglial proportion were observed between AD and control samples. The study did not report strong associations between microglial subtypes and genetic (e.g., APOE) or demographic factors, nor did it identify a clear trajectory of microglial activation or a disease-stage progression for these subtypes.\n\nValidation with previous snRNA-seq data (Mathys et al., 2019) found only 13 overlapping microglial DEGs, with most showing concordant directionality, supporting the robustness of the observed changes but also highlighting limited overlap with prior datasets. <keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial transcriptomic changes in AD are modest and partially overlap with previous studies, but do not reveal a dominant disease-associated microglial (DAM) signature.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nNo spatial or morphological validation of microglial subtypes was performed. The study did not report on microglial morphology, activation scores, or direct links to AD pathology (e.g., amyloid or tau load).\n\n<clinical>\nThe reduction of the m6 microglial subpopulation in AD suggests a loss of cells involved in complement-mediated synaptic pruning and cytokine signaling. This may contribute to synaptic dysfunction, a hallmark of AD, by disrupting the balance of synaptic elimination and maintenance. However, the findings are associative and do not establish causality. The absence of a strong DAM-like signature or clear disease-stage trajectory for microglia in this dataset suggests that microglial responses in AD may be more heterogeneous or context-dependent than previously thought. Therapeutic implications are limited, but restoring or modulating complement-related microglial functions could be explored as a potential strategy.\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications**\n\nThis study refines our understanding of microglial heterogeneity in the human AD brain. The identification of a reduced C1QA/B/C+, IL4R+, IL1RAP+ (m6) microglial subpopulation highlights the importance of complement-mediated synaptic pruning in AD pathogenesis. However, the lack of a robust DAM-like signature and the modest overlap with prior snRNA-seq studies (e.g., Mathys et al., 2019) suggest that microglial responses may vary by brain region, disease stage, or technical approach. Open questions include whether the loss of m6 microglia is a cause or consequence of synaptic dysfunction, how these subtypes relate to known microglial activation states (e.g., DAM, PAM), and whether similar changes occur in other brain regions or in response to genetic risk factors. Future studies should integrate spatial, morphological, and longitudinal data to clarify the functional roles of microglial subtypes in AD and their potential as therapeutic targets. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

The authors generated a novel dataset of 1.4 million single nuclei from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, Brodmann area 9/46) of 150 AD cases and 149 controls (age >60), using 10x Genomics and nuclei hashing for multiplexing. Cell types were annotated via expert curation and machine learning, with microglia identified as \"Micro_PVM.\" Technical replicates, batch effects, and donor-level covariates were rigorously modeled using precision-weighted linear mixed models.  \n</methods>\n\n<findings>\n**Cell Type Proportions and Technical Reproducibility**  \nMicroglia (Micro_PVM) were robustly identified among 22 cell clusters. The median fraction of gene expression variance in microglia explained by subject was 50.9%, indicating high reproducibility across technical replicates. Only 143 genes in microglia had >5% variance explained by AD status, suggesting that disease effects are modest and require large sample sizes for detection. Batch effects (sample pool) explained >5% variance for 668 genes, but for most genes, batch effects were minimal. There was a significant correlation between batch effect variance and gene GC content, consistent with known PCR artifacts.\n\n**Differential Gene Expression in Microglia**  \nA total of 826 genes were differentially expressed in microglia between AD and controls at a study-wide FDR of 5%. The most prominent finding was the upregulation of **PTPRG** (protein tyrosine phosphatase receptor gamma), with a log2 fold change of 1.52 and a p-value of 9.28e-28. This effect was highly specific to microglia, with only minor changes in a few neuronal subtypes. Other notable upregulated genes included **DUSP10** and **ALCAM**, while **DPYD** was also highlighted.\n\n<keyFinding priority='1'>The upregulation of PTPRG in microglia is the most significant disease-associated transcriptional change, with a large effect size and high specificity for microglia compared to other brain cell types.</keyFinding>\n<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Pathway Enrichment and Functional Signatures**  \nGene set analysis revealed that microglia in AD showed specific upregulation of the **p38MAPK cascade**, a pathway implicated in microglial inflammatory responses. DUSP10, a top upregulated gene, is a component of this pathway. No evidence was presented for distinct microglial subtypes (e.g., DAM, homeostatic, or intermediate states) within this dataset; the analysis focused on the aggregate microglial population.\n\n<keyFinding priority='2'>Microglia in AD exhibit upregulation of inflammatory signaling, particularly the p38MAPK cascade, supporting a role for microglial activation in disease.</keyFinding>\n<confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Cell Subtype Identification & Characterization**  \nThe study did not report further subdivision of microglia into distinct subtypes or states (e.g., homeostatic vs. disease-associated microglia) within the main text. Microglia were treated as a single cluster (\"Micro_PVM\") for differential expression and variance partitioning analyses. Thus, no explicit marker gene sets or functional roles for microglial subtypes were delineated beyond the disease-associated upregulation of PTPRG and inflammatory pathways.\n\n**Modulators & Metrics**  \nVariance partitioning showed that subject identity was the dominant source of expression variance in microglia, followed by batch effects for a subset of genes. Disease status explained a modest but significant fraction of variance for a limited set of genes, including PTPRG. Sex and age contributed minimally to variance in microglial gene expression.\n\n**Gene Regulatory Networks and Cell-Cell Communication**  \nNo explicit analysis of gene regulatory networks or ligand-receptor interactions involving microglia was reported.\n\n**Spatial Analysis and Morphological Validation**  \nNo spatial transcriptomics or immunohistochemical validation of microglial findings was presented.\n\n**Aging/Disease Trajectories**  \nNo pseudotime or trajectory analysis of microglial states was performed; the analysis was cross-sectional.\n\n**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**  \nThe authors note that PTPRG is not located in a region with AD GWAS risk variants, suggesting its upregulation is likely reactive rather than genetically driven.

While PTPRG is an inflammatory marker, its precise mechanistic role in AD remains unclear. The lack of genetic association suggests it may be a downstream or reactive marker of microglial activation. The upregulation of the p38MAPK cascade further implicates microglial inflammatory pathways in AD pathogenesis. These results may inform future biomarker development or therapeutic targeting of microglial activation, but causal or temporal relationships cannot be established from this cross-sectional data.  \n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications**\n\nThis study provides strong evidence for disease-associated transcriptional activation of microglia in AD, particularly via upregulation of PTPRG and inflammatory signaling pathways. However, the lack of reported microglial subtypes or states (e.g., DAM, homeostatic) limits direct comparison to prior single-cell studies that have identified such heterogeneity. The authors explicitly note that PTPRG upregulation is consistent with two out of three previous human microglia transcriptome studies, but not with AD GWAS loci, highlighting a potential divergence between genetic risk and reactive transcriptional changes. Open questions remain regarding the functional consequences of PTPRG upregulation, its potential as a biomarker, and whether more granular microglial subtypes could be resolved with alternative clustering or spatial approaches. Future work should address the temporal dynamics of microglial activation, integrate genetic and multi-omic data, and validate findings with spatial or morphological methods.\n\n<contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>  \nThe authors discuss that, unlike some previous studies, they do not identify PTPRG as an AD risk gene by GWAS, and that its upregulation may be reactive rather than causal. They also note that only a subset of prior microglial transcriptome studies report consistent PTPRG upregulation, suggesting some heterogeneity in the literature.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table of Microglial Findings**\n\n| Subtype/State | Marker Genes | Functional Signature | Disease Association | Validation/Notes |\n|---------------|-------------|---------------------|--------------------|------------------|\n| Micro_PVM     | PTPRG↑, DUSP10↑, ALCAM↑ | Inflammatory, p38MAPK cascade upregulation | Strongly upregulated in AD | No spatial/morphological validation; no further subtypes reported |\n\n---\n\n**Tag Usage Recap**  \n- <keyFinding priority='1'>PTPRG upregulation in microglia is the major disease-associated change.</keyFinding>\n- <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> for PTPRG finding (large effect, robust stats).\n- <contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag> for explicit discussion of GWAS and prior transcriptome study differences.\n- <keyFinding priority='2'>p38MAPK cascade upregulation in microglia.</keyFinding>\n- <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> for pathway-level inference (based on gene set analysis, not direct functional validation).\n- <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> for most other findings."

Future studies should focus on spatial validation, longitudinal dynamics, and experimental manipulation of these microglial states to clarify causality and therapeutic potential.

The authors did not report any pathways or gene modules specifically up- or downregulated in microglial subpopulations with disease progression.\n\n**Modulators & Metrics:**  \nNo significant effects of host factors (age, sex, APOE genotype) or genetic risk variants on microglial states were reported, as the cohort was restricted to male APOE ε3/ε3 individuals.\n\n**Spatial Analysis & Validation:**  \nNo spatial or morphological validation of microglial states was performed in this study.\n\n**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  \nWhile microglial abundance trended upward in the EC with disease progression, no evidence for stage-specific transitions or activation trajectories was found at the transcriptomic level.\n\n**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  \nNo eQTL or multi-omic integration for microglia was performed.\n\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nThe study provides limited evidence for microglial involvement in AD at the transcriptomic level using snRNA-seq. While microgliosis (increased microglial numbers) is a well-established feature of AD, this dataset did not reveal distinct disease-associated microglial states or robust gene expression changes. The authors caution that technical limitations of snRNA-seq (low gene detection in microglia, nuclear depletion of DAM markers) may obscure detection of such states. Thus, the findings do not support a major disease-driving or mitigating role for specific microglial subtypes in this dataset, nor do they suggest immediate biomarker or therapeutic implications for microglial states as defined here.\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n3) **Research Implications**\n\nThis study highlights the technical challenges of profiling microglial heterogeneity and activation states using single-nucleus RNA-seq in human postmortem brain. The inability to robustly detect DAM or other disease-associated microglial signatures—despite trends in cell abundance—suggests that nuclear RNA may not adequately capture the full spectrum of microglial activation, especially for genes enriched in the cytoplasm or induced in disease. The authors’ findings are consistent with recent reports (e.g., Thrupp et al., 2020) that snRNA-seq underrepresents DAM markers in human tissue. Future studies may require single-cell (whole-cell) RNA-seq, spatial transcriptomics, or proteomic approaches to resolve microglial states in AD. The lack of strong microglial subtype findings in this study does not contradict the established role of microglia in AD, but underscores the need for improved methodologies. No explicit conflicts with prior models are discussed by the authors.\n\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

The study also provides validated markers (e.g., CD74^high^) for in situ identification of this subtype, which may serve as a biomarker for disease progression or therapeutic response. <keyFinding priority='1'></keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications**\n\nThis work establishes a foundational map of human microglial heterogeneity, highlighting the existence of a disease-associated, antigen-presenting microglial subtype (cluster 7) that is selectively depleted in Alzheimer’s disease. The study’s integration of scRNA-seq, histological validation, and cross-dataset replication strengthens confidence in these findings. Open questions remain regarding the functional role of cluster 7—whether its loss contributes causally to AD pathology or reflects a downstream effect—and whether similar subtypes exist in other brain regions or neurological diseases. The distribution of the DAM signature across multiple human clusters, rather than a single population as in mouse models, suggests important species differences in microglial responses to neurodegeneration. Future research should focus on the mechanistic role of cluster 7 in AD, its potential as a therapeutic target, and the development of strategies to preserve or restore this subtype. The study’s marker-based approach (e.g., CD74^high^) enables further in situ and functional studies, and the data provide a reference for aligning future single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analyses. <contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag> (Authors explicitly discuss that the DAM signature is less discrete in human microglia than in mouse models, highlighting a key departure from prior animal-based models.)"

Cell type annotation, gene module discovery (scdemon), and spatial/morphological validation (RNAscope, immunohistochemistry) were employed.\n</methods>\n\n<findings>\n**Cell Type Proportions and Regional Distribution**\nMicroglia/immune cells comprised ~7.9% of all nuclei, with lower abundance in neocortical regions compared to allocortex and thalamus. Regional differences in microglial abundance were consistent across individuals and not significantly altered by AD status at the major cell type level.\n\n**Microglial Subtype Identification & Characterization**\nThe study identified microglia as a major cell class but did not report a detailed breakdown of microglial subtypes using unique nomenclature (e.g., DAM, Mic.1, etc.) as seen in some prior studies. Instead, microglial heterogeneity was primarily explored through gene expression modules and GWAS enrichment, rather than discrete subclustering.\n\n- **Gene Expression Modules:** Microglial gene modules included identity programs (e.g., T cell, macrophage, cycling microglia [MKI67+]), and functional modules enriched for NF-κB signaling, interferon response, p53/DNA damage, and TGFβ signaling. These modules were largely shared across regions, with little evidence for strong region-specific microglial subtypes.\n- **GWAS Enrichment:** Microglia and immune cells showed the highest enrichment for AD GWAS risk genes across all regions, with the TPT1+ microglial subtype and macrophages in HC, TH, and AG showing the strongest disease-relevance scores (<keyFinding priority='1'>Microglia are the principal cell type expressing AD GWAS risk genes, with region-specific expression of genes such as PLCG2 (EC), APOE and SORL1 (TH), and MS4A4A (MT)</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n- **Region-Specific Expression:** Eight GWAS genes showed region-specific expression in microglia, but no evidence was found for region-specific microglial subtypes analogous to those in astrocytes or oligodendrocytes.\n\n**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**\n- **AD-Associated Changes:** Microglial DEGs in AD were broadly enriched for upregulation of clathrin-coated endocytosis and downregulation of viral response genes. Region-specific enrichments included upregulation of MHC-II binding in EC and HC, RNA processing in TH, glycolysis in PFC and EC, and downregulation of phagocytosis and phospholipase signaling in HC.\n- **Pathology-Specific Responses:** Microglial DEGs associated with neuritic plaque and NFT burden overlapped substantially with those for pathologic AD diagnosis. Microglia showed upregulation of glycolysis genes in response to diffuse plaques, with core glycolytic drivers (e.g., GAPDH, BNIP3L) upregulated in response to NFT burden and cognitive impairment (<keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial metabolic reprogramming (glycolysis, glycogen metabolism) is a prominent feature of AD pathology, especially in response to amyloid plaques</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n- **GWAS and Familial AD Genes:** Of 149 AD risk genes, 75 were maximally expressed in microglia, and 30 were differentially expressed in microglia in AD, especially in regions with high neuritic plaque density (e.g., APOE, HLA-DRA, PILRA, SORT1).\n\n**Cell-Cell Communication**\n- Microglial ligand-receptor interactions were not a major focus, but the study notes that predicted cell-cell communication events were mostly shared across regions, with no microglia-specific regional interactions highlighted.\n\n**Spatial/Morphological Validation**\n- No specific spatial or morphological validation of microglial subtypes was reported, in contrast to the detailed in situ validation performed for astrocyte and neuronal subtypes.\n\n**Aging/Disease Trajectories**\n- The study did not report microglial pseudotime or trajectory analyses, nor did it identify microglial subtypes associated with specific AD stages or aging transitions.\n\n**Genetic and Host Modulators**\n- Microglial modules were enriched for AD GWAS risk genes, and APOE-ε4 status was associated with increased expression of certain chaperone modules, but no strong genotype-specific microglial subtypes were described.\n\n**Summary of Negative Findings**\n- Unlike astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, microglia did not show strong region-specific subtypes or modules. The authors explicitly note that immune cells (including microglia) showed little regional specificity, and microglial responses to AD pathology were largely consistent across brain regions.\n\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nMicroglia are the principal cell type expressing and responding to AD GWAS risk genes, with broad upregulation of immune and metabolic pathways in AD, especially in response to amyloid plaques and NFTs. While microglial metabolic reprogramming (notably glycolysis and glycogen metabolism) is a prominent feature of AD pathology, the lack of strong region- or stage-specific microglial subtypes suggests a relatively uniform response across the brain. These findings reinforce the centrality of microglia in AD genetic risk and pathology, but suggest that therapeutic targeting may need to focus on shared, rather than region-specific, microglial programs. <keyFinding priority='1'>Microglia are the main cell type linking AD genetic risk to cellular pathology, but do not display the regional or subtype heterogeneity seen in astrocytes or neurons</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>.\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**\nMicroglia in this multiregion snRNA-seq atlas of Alzheimer’s disease are the principal cell type expressing AD GWAS risk genes, with region-specific expression of genes such as PLCG2 (EC), APOE and SORL1 (TH), and MS4A4A (MT). However, microglia do not display strong region- or disease-specific subtypes; instead, their response to AD is characterized by broad upregulation of immune and metabolic pathways (notably glycolysis) across all regions and pathologies. Microglial metabolic reprogramming is especially prominent in response to amyloid plaques, but no evidence for regionally restricted microglial states was found.\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications (≈150 words):**\nThis study provides a comprehensive, region-spanning atlas of microglial transcriptional states in the aged human brain, revealing that microglia are the main cellular hub for AD genetic risk and pathology-associated gene expression. However, the absence of strong region- or stage-specific microglial subtypes, in contrast to astrocytes and neurons, suggests that microglial responses to AD are largely uniform across brain regions. This finding aligns with some prior reports but contrasts with studies in mouse models or human cortex that have described disease-associated microglia (DAM) or regionally restricted microglial states. The authors do not explicitly discuss contradictions with prior models, but their data suggest that, at least in late-stage human AD, microglial heterogeneity is less pronounced than that of other glial or neuronal populations. Open questions include whether earlier disease stages or spatially resolved methods might reveal more microglial diversity, and how microglial metabolic reprogramming contributes to neurodegeneration and could be therapeutically targeted.\n\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

As such, no conclusions regarding microglial heterogeneity, activation, or involvement in NFT pathology can be drawn from this work.\n\n---\n\n**Detailed Summary (≈800–1000 words):**\nThe paper by Otero-Garcia et al. (2022) presents a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic analysis of neuronal vulnerability to neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) pathology in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) using a novel FACS-based method to isolate and profile single neuronal somas from human prefrontal cortex. The study’s primary aim was to resolve the molecular signatures distinguishing NFT-prone from NFT-resistant neuronal subtypes and to uncouple NFT susceptibility from neuronal death. Over 120,000 single-cell transcriptomes were generated from both AD and control brains, with a focus on 20 neocortical neuronal subtypes.\n\nHowever, microglia were not a focus of this investigation. The cell isolation protocol specifically targeted MAP2+ neuronal somas, and the main datasets and clustering analyses were restricted to excitatory and inhibitory neurons. While the authors briefly mention that their FACS method could, in principle, be used to isolate glial cells with tau aggregates (as demonstrated in PSP tissue), no such analysis was performed for microglia in the AD or control samples. There is no mention of microglial marker genes, subtypes, or activation states in the results, figures, or supplementary materials.\n\nConsequently, the study does not report on:\n- Microglial cell type proportions or changes in AD versus control.\n- Differential gene expression or pathway enrichment in microglia.\n- Identification or characterization of microglial subtypes (e.g., homeostatic, DAM, proliferative).\n- Associations between microglial states and NFT burden, amyloid pathology, or clinical variables.\n- Morphological or spatial validation of microglial activation or clustering.\n- Modulation of microglial states by host or genetic factors (e.g., APOE, age, sex).\n- Microglia-specific gene regulatory networks, ligand-receptor interactions, or cell-cell communication.\n- Temporal modeling or disease trajectory analysis for microglia.\n- Integration of microglial transcriptomes with GWAS or eQTL data.\n\nThe absence of microglial data is a direct consequence of the study’s design, which prioritized neuronal profiling to address questions of selective neuronal vulnerability to tau pathology. The authors do not discuss microglial findings from other studies, nor do they comment on the potential role of microglia in NFT formation or neurodegeneration within their own data.\n\n<keyFinding priority='3'>\nThe lack of microglial analysis is a clear limitation for those interested in glial contributions to AD, but it is consistent with the study’s stated aims and methodology.\n</keyFinding>\n<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications (≈100–200 words):**\nThis study provides no new information on microglial heterogeneity, activation, or disease association in Alzheimer’s disease. The absence of microglial data highlights a gap in the single-cell landscape of AD presented here, especially given the growing recognition of microglia as key modulators of neurodegeneration and tau pathology in other recent sc/snRNA-seq studies. Future work using similar high-throughput single-cell approaches should include microglia and other glial populations to enable a more comprehensive understanding of cell-type-specific responses to tau aggregation and neurodegeneration. Integration of neuronal and microglial transcriptomic data, particularly in spatial context, will be essential to elucidate cell-cell interactions and the contribution of microglial states (e.g., DAM, interferon-responsive, proliferative) to AD progression and NFT pathology. The authors’ FACS-based method could, in principle, be adapted for microglial profiling, but such analyses remain to be performed.\n\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

TREM2 reduced-activation variants promote a homeostatic microglial state (Mic-reduced), potentially reducing microglial activation and altering disease progression. The MS4A resilience allele (rs1582763-A) is associated with a distinct proinflammatory microglial state (Mic-proinflammatory) with altered complement signaling (C3 up, C5 down), which may underlie its protective effect. APOEε4 carriers show reduced microglial states involved in perineuronal net maintenance, potentially contributing to impaired plasticity and cognitive decline.

The Mic-stress state, highly enriched in ADAD, may represent a unique, advanced, or accelerated microglial response not captured by canonical DAM/MGnD/HAM signatures, and is linked to MECP2 upregulation and stress pathways. TREM2 reduced-activation variants promote a homeostatic microglial state (Mic-reduced), potentially reducing microglial activation and altering disease progression. The MS4A resilience allele (rs1582763-A) is associated with a distinct proinflammatory microglial state (Mic-proinflammatory) with altered complement signaling (C3 up, C5 down), which may underlie its protective effect. APOEε4 carriers show reduced microglial states involved in perineuronal net maintenance, potentially contributing to impaired plasticity and cognitive decline. These findings suggest that microglial heterogeneity, shaped by genetic background, may drive or mitigate AD pathology and could inform therapeutic targeting of specific microglial states.\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications (≈100–200 words):**\n\nThis study demonstrates that microglial heterogeneity in the human parietal cortex is strongly shaped by AD genetic architecture, with distinct subtypes associated with ADAD, TREM2, MS4A, and APOEε4 status. The identification of a unique ADAD-enriched stress-response microglial state (Mic-stress), not matching canonical DAM/MGnD/HAM, suggests that current models may not fully capture the diversity of microglial responses in genetic AD. The strong genotype-specific enrichment of homeostatic (Mic-reduced) and proinflammatory (Mic-proinflammatory) states in TREM2 and MS4A variant carriers, respectively, highlights the need for precision targeting of microglial subtypes in therapeutic development. The findings align with, but also extend, prior classification schemes by revealing novel states and genetic drivers. Open questions include the functional consequences of these states for neurodegeneration, their temporal dynamics in disease progression, and their potential as biomarkers or therapeutic targets. The study’s integration of snRNA-seq, snATAC-seq, and replication in independent datasets strengthens confidence in these findings, though further work is needed to dissect causal mechanisms and validate these states in additional brain regions and longitudinal cohorts.

TREM2 risk variant carriers (p.R47H, p.R62H, p.H157Y) show increased proportions of a resting-like microglial state (Mic.2), while carriers of the MS4A resilience allele (rs1582763-A) are enriched for a distinct proinflammatory microglial state (Mic.3).

Deep subclustering identified cell-type-specific transcriptional states. Replication was performed using human dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (ROSMAP) and 5xFAD mouse model datasets. Validation included pathway analysis and cross-cohort signature scoring.\n</methods>\n\n<findings>\n**Cell Type Proportions and Subtype Identification**\n\nMicroglia were subclustered into nine transcriptional states. Three states—Mic.4, Mic.2, and Mic.3—showed strong associations with specific genetic backgrounds and disease status.\n\n**Mic.4: ADAD-Enriched Microglial State**\n<keyFinding priority='1'>\nMic.4 is a prominent microglial state highly enriched in ADAD (APP/PSEN1 mutation carriers; β=0.40, P=2.50×10⁻³), comprising nuclei from 11 PSEN1 carriers and one TREM2 p.R136W carrier. This state is not significantly overlapping with previously described DAM, MGnD, or HAM signatures, indicating a potentially novel disease-associated microglial phenotype.\n</keyFinding>\n<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nMic.4 is defined by upregulation of MECP2 (β=0.67, Adj.P=3.20×10⁻¹⁰), a gene implicated in neuronal cell death and Rett syndrome, and is enriched for pathways including MAPK signaling, estrogen signaling, NOD-like receptor signaling, and necroptosis—suggesting an acute, cell-death–related response. This state was also observed in 5xFAD mouse cortex (P=1.92×10⁻³⁷⁴), supporting cross-species relevance.\n\n**Mic.2: TREM2 Risk Variant-Associated Resting-Like Microglia**\n<keyFinding priority='1'>\nTREM2 risk variant carriers (p.R47H, p.R62H, p.H157Y) exhibit increased proportions of Mic.2 (β=0.23, P=3.29×10⁻²), a microglial state with high expression of resting-state markers (TMEM119, P2RY13, MED12L, SELPLG) and minimal activation marker expression. This suggests a reduced-activation or homeostatic-like phenotype in these carriers.\n</keyFinding>\n<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nReplication in the ROSMAP cohort (DLPFC) confirmed enrichment of this state in TREM2 p.R62H carriers (β=0.20, P=2.58×10⁻²; meta-analysis P=2.26×10⁻²). This aligns with prior reports of reduced microglial activation in these TREM2 variants.\n\n**Mic.3: MS4A Resilience Variant-Associated Proinflammatory Microglia**\n<keyFinding priority='1'>\nCarriers of the MS4A resilience allele (rs1582763-A) are enriched for Mic.3 (β=0.15, P=1.67×10⁻³), a microglial state with a distinct proinflammatory profile, including upregulation of IL1B (log2FC=3.45), CD14, FCGR3A, and CD40. This state is distinct from the main activated microglia (Mic.1), which is depleted in rs1582763-A carriers.\n</keyFinding>\n<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nMic.3 is characterized by increased expression of complement C3 (log2FC=-1.24), TGF-β signaling genes (TGFBR1, TGFBR2), and cytokine response pathways, contrasting with Mic.1, which shows higher C5 and BMP signaling. The presence of Mic.3 in the ROSMAP cohort was confirmed by signature scoring, though association with genotype was not significant, likely due to low numbers of homozygous carriers.\n\n**Other Microglial States**\nMic.1 represents the main activated microglial state, upregulated for CD68, CD83, TNFAIP3, C5AR1, GPNMB, and ABCA1, and overlaps with DAM, MGnD, HAM, and aging signatures. Its proportion is reduced in MS4A resilience allele carriers.\n\n**Genetic Modulators and Disease Trajectories**\n- The TREM2 p.R136W variant, though rare, showed a microglial transcriptional profile clustering with ADAD rather than other TREM2 variants, suggesting a more severe or distinct impact.\n- No unique microglial state was associated with APOE ε4, though pathway analysis indicated upregulation of ribosome biogenesis and mitotic checkpoint genes in microglia from ε4 carriers.\n\n**Validation and Replication**\n- The Mic.4 (ADAD-enriched) state was validated in 5xFAD mouse microglia, with strong conservation of the upregulated gene signature.\n- The Mic.2 (TREM2 risk variant) and Mic.3 (MS4A resilience) states were replicated in the ROSMAP human DLPFC dataset, supporting their generalizability across brain regions and cohorts.\n\n**Pathway Enrichment and Functional Implications**\n- Mic.4: MAPK, estrogen, NOD-like receptor, necroptosis pathways (cell death, acute response).\n- Mic.2: Resting/homeostatic microglial markers, reduced activation.\n- Mic.3: Proinflammatory cytokine response, complement C3, TGF-β signaling, cytokine and LPS response.\n\n**Cell-Cell Communication and Cross-Talk**\n- MS4A resilience allele carriers also showed decreased resting astrocytes and a trend toward increased activated astrocytes, despite MS4A genes not being expressed in astrocytes, suggesting possible microglia-astrocyte cross-talk.\n\n**Aging/Disease Trajectories**\n- The ADAD-enriched microglial state (Mic.4) may represent an advanced or accelerated disease stage, as similar states are found in late-stage pathology in both ADAD and sAD (ROSMAP DLPFC).\n\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nMicroglial heterogeneity in AD is strongly shaped by genetic background. The ADAD-enriched Mic.4 state may contribute to acute neurodegeneration via cell death pathways, while TREM2 risk variants promote a less activated, potentially less protective microglial phenotype. The MS4A resilience allele shifts microglia toward a proinflammatory but potentially protective state (Mic.3), with upregulation of complement C3 and TGF-β signaling, both implicated in neuroprotection. These findings suggest that microglial states are not only markers but may actively modulate disease progression, and that genetic stratification could inform therapeutic targeting of microglial subtypes in AD.\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications (≈200 words)**\n\nThis study provides a comprehensive map of microglial heterogeneity in the human AD cortex, revealing that genetic risk and resilience variants drive distinct microglial states with unique transcriptional and functional signatures. The identification of Mic.4 as an ADAD-specific, cell-death–associated microglial state, and the demonstration that TREM2 and MS4A variants modulate microglial activation, highlight the need for genetic stratification in both research and clinical trials. The findings align with, but also extend, previous microglial classification schemes (e.g., DAM, MGnD, HAM), as several newly described states (Mic.4, Mic.2, Mic.3) do not fully overlap with established signatures, suggesting additional layers of microglial diversity.\n\nOpen questions include the precise functional consequences of these microglial states in vivo, their temporal dynamics during disease progression, and their potential as therapeutic targets. The study’s cross-validation in independent human and mouse datasets strengthens confidence in these subtypes, but further work is needed to dissect causal relationships and to determine whether modulating specific microglial states can alter disease trajectory. The explicit mapping of GWAS loci to microglial subtypes also provides a framework for future cell-type–specific functional genomics in AD.\n\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

The experimental workflow involved NeuN+ sorting to enrich for neuronal nuclei, with glial nuclei (including microglia) representing only a minor fraction (~6%) of the dataset.

The authors state: “Because our study was focused on neurons, glial nuclei were excluded from the subsequent analyses.”\n- **Subtype Identification:** No microglial subtypes or states were identified, named, or characterized.

Multiomic analysis enabled joint profiling of gene expression and chromatin accessibility in the same nuclei. Cell type annotation, pseudotime/disease trajectory modeling, and peak–gene association analyses were performed. Validation included RNA-FISH on human tissue.\n</methods>\n\n---\n\n**Quick Reference**\n\nThis study reveals that microglia in the human midbrain undergo significant transcriptional changes with aging and further alterations in Parkinson’s disease (PD), as shown by single-nucleus multiomic profiling. Distinct microglial subpopulations—including homeostatic, aging, and a small TREM2-independent disease-associated state—were identified, with their proportions and gene expression signatures shifting along an age-to-disease trajectory. The microglial pseudopathogenesis trajectory is strongly modulated by age and PD status, with increased immune activation and loss of homeostatic features.\n\n---\n\n**Detailed Summary**\n\n<findings>\n**Cell Type Proportions and General Trends**\n\nMicroglia (MG) constitute the second most abundant glial population in the human substantia nigra, after oligodendrocytes. Quantitative analysis revealed a statistically significant increase in microglial proportion from young to aged (P=0.007) and from aged to PD (P=0.042) (<keyFinding priority='2'>), suggesting both aging and PD are associated with microgliosis or increased microglial representation in this region. <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Microglial Subtype Identification and Characterization**\n\nRe-clustering and trajectory analysis of microglia identified several subpopulations:\n- **Homeostatic Microglia**: Characterized by high expression of canonical markers such as P2RY12, HEXB, CST3, CX3CR1, CTSD, CSF1R, CTSS, SPARC, TMSB4X, C1QA, and C1QB. These cells predominate in young donors and are progressively reduced with aging and PD. <keyFinding priority='2'> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n- **Aging Microglia**: Defined by increased expression of genes such as IL15, CLEC2B, and DOCK5, which are associated with age-related microglial activation and immune signaling. This population expands with age and is further increased in PD. <keyFinding priority='2'> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n- **Stage 1 Disease-Associated Microglia (DAM, TREM2-independent)**: A small but distinct cluster expressing TYROBP, CTSB, APOE, B2M, and FTH1, but lacking strong TREM2 upregulation. This state is more prominent in PD, consistent with a disease-associated activation profile. <keyFinding priority='1'> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nNo clear evidence for a robust TREM2-dependent DAM population was found in this midbrain dataset, in contrast to some Alzheimer’s disease studies. <contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag> (The authors note this difference and attribute it to disease context and brain region.)\n\n**Pseudopathogenesis Trajectory and Disease Progression**\n\nA combined pseudopathogenesis (cPP) trajectory, integrating both transcriptomic and chromatin accessibility data, was constructed for microglia. This trajectory revealed a significant, stepwise increase in cPP scores from young to aged to PD samples (P for Y/A = 1.71×10⁻⁸, Y/P = 1.71×10⁻⁸, A/P = 1.71×10⁻⁸), indicating progressive molecular changes in microglia along the aging-to-disease axis. <keyFinding priority='1'> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**\n\nGenes upregulated along the microglial cPP trajectory (n=894) were enriched for pathways related to immune activation, cytokine-mediated signaling, and chemotaxis, while downregulated genes (n=254) were associated with cell adhesion and homeostatic functions. This suggests a shift from a surveillant/homeostatic state toward a more reactive, pro-inflammatory phenotype with aging and PD. <keyFinding priority='1'> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Gene Module Analysis**\n\nModule scoring confirmed a decrease in homeostatic microglial gene signatures and an increase in both aging and stage 1 DAM signatures along the cPP trajectory. This was visualized as a loss of homeostatic features and a gain of disease/aging-associated activation in microglia as individuals progress from young to aged to PD. <keyFinding priority='1'> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Chromatin Accessibility and Peak–Gene Associations**\n\nDespite robust transcriptional changes, chromatin accessibility profiles (ATAC-seq) within microglia showed surprisingly little difference between young, aged, and PD groups. However, peak–gene association analysis revealed that the regulatory relationships between accessible chromatin regions and gene expression are substantially altered during aging and PD, particularly at distal enhancer regions. <keyFinding priority='2'> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**GWAS SNP Enrichment**\n\nMicroglial-specific ATAC peaks were significantly enriched for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) GWAS SNPs, but not for PD SNPs, consistent with previous studies. However, some PD-associated SNPs were found in microglial peaks, and their regulatory associations (peak–gene links) changed with disease state, suggesting potential cell-type-specific regulatory mechanisms. <keyFinding priority='2'> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Modulators & Metrics**\n\nAge and PD status are the primary modulators of microglial state transitions in this study. No strong evidence for sex or APOE genotype effects on microglia is discussed in this paper.\n\n**Spatial/Morphological Validation**\n\nNo specific spatial or morphological validation of microglial subtypes is reported; validation is primarily at the transcriptomic and chromatin level.\n\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nMicroglia in the human midbrain exhibit a progressive loss of homeostatic features and increased immune activation with aging, which is further exacerbated in Parkinson’s disease. The emergence of a TREM2-independent disease-associated microglial state in PD suggests a distinct activation pathway from that described in Alzheimer’s disease. These findings imply that microglial dysfunction and chronic activation may contribute to PD pathogenesis, potentially via neuroinflammatory mechanisms. While the study identifies molecular signatures and regulatory changes, it does not establish direct causality between microglial changes and neuronal degeneration. The altered microglial gene modules and trajectory scores may serve as potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets for modulating neuroinflammation in PD, but further functional validation is required.\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications**\n\nThis study provides a high-resolution, multiomic map of microglial heterogeneity and state transitions in the aging and PD midbrain. The identification of a TREM2-independent disease-associated microglial state in PD contrasts with the TREM2-dependent DAM described in Alzheimer’s disease, highlighting disease- and region-specific microglial responses (<contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>). The strong association of microglial activation with aging and PD progression underscores the need to dissect the functional consequences of these states, particularly their roles in neuroinflammation and neuronal vulnerability. Open questions include the causal relationship between microglial activation and dopaminergic neuron loss, the reversibility of disease-associated states, and the impact of genetic risk variants on microglial function. The study’s findings align with emerging models of microglial diversity but also reveal unique features in the human midbrain, suggesting that therapeutic strategies may need to be tailored to disease context and brain region. Future work should integrate spatial transcriptomics, functional assays, and longitudinal sampling to clarify the dynamics and impact of microglial subtypes in PD.\n\n---\n\n**Tag Summary**:  \n- <keyFinding priority='1'>: Identification of aging and disease-associated microglial states, cPP trajectory, and loss of homeostatic features in PD.  \n- <keyFinding priority='2'>: Proportion changes, gene module shifts, altered peak–gene associations, GWAS SNP enrichment.  \n- <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> for major findings with robust sample size and trajectory analysis; <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> for regulatory and GWAS associations.  \n- <contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag> for the absence of TREM2-dependent DAM in PD microglia, as explicitly discussed by the authors."

After quality control, 4786 nuclei were analyzed, with cell types assigned via unsupervised clustering and supervised classification based on curated marker gene sets. Sub-clustering and differential expression analyses were performed for each major cell type, including microglia. Validation experiments focused on astrocytes, with limited morphological or spatial validation for microglia.\n</methods>\n\n<findings>\nMicroglia represented a small but consistent fraction of nuclei in both HD and control samples (3% each), with no significant change in overall abundance. However, microglial nuclei from HD and control brains clustered separately in tSNE and consensus clustering analyses, indicating a marked disease-associated transcriptional shift.\n\nDifferential gene expression analysis revealed that HD microglia upregulate a suite of genes involved in innate immune activation and inflammation. Pathway enrichment analyses highlighted significant upregulation of complement cascade components, toll-like receptor signaling, and interleukin signaling pathways (notably IL-10, IL-13, and IL-4). These findings are consistent with a robust activation of microglia in the HD cortex, paralleling observations in other neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nThe study did not identify or name discrete microglial subtypes or states (such as homeostatic, disease-associated microglia [DAM], or proliferative states) within the HD or control samples. Instead, the primary finding was a global shift in microglial gene expression toward an activated, inflammatory profile in HD. No evidence was presented for the emergence of novel microglial subpopulations or for the loss of homeostatic microglial markers.\n\nMorphological or spatial validation of microglial activation was not performed. While immunohistochemistry for microglial markers (e.g., IBA1, LN3) was conducted, the main focus was on astrocytic changes, and no quantitative or qualitative assessment of microglial morphology or spatial distribution was reported.\n\nNo trajectory or pseudotime analysis was performed for microglia, and the study did not address potential transitions between microglial states over the course of disease progression. Similarly, no analysis of host or genetic factors (such as age, sex, CAG repeat length, or GWAS variants) influencing microglial activation was presented.\n\nGene network and module analyses were performed for astrocytes but not for microglia.

The clear separation of these states, their spatial validation, and their correlation with pathology load represent a significant advance over previous human snRNA-seq studies, which lacked the power or enrichment to resolve these subtypes. The findings align AD1-microglia with mouse DAM/ARM models, but AD2-microglia appear unique to human tau pathology. Open questions include the functional consequences of AD2-microglia, their potential neuroprotective or detrimental roles, and whether modulating these states can alter disease trajectory. The study’s explicit integration of GWAS data with microglial subtypes strengthens the case for microglia as a central player in AD pathogenesis. No explicit contradictions with prior models are discussed by the authors, but the identification of a tau-associated microglial state not seen in mouse models highlights the need for human-specific research.\n\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

The absence of direct viral detection in the brain, alongside robust microglial activation, highlights the importance of systemic immune-brain communication. Open questions include the long-term fate of these microglial states, their precise functional impact on neuronal health, and whether similar activation occurs in milder or chronic COVID-19.

The sequential activation of these subtypes along the AD trajectory, and their distinct molecular and morphological signatures, provide a roadmap for future mechanistic studies and therapeutic targeting. The explicit causal modeling and spatial validation strengthen the link between microglial state transitions and AD pathology, moving beyond associative case-control designs. Open questions remain regarding the upstream triggers of Mic.12 activation, the reversibility of Mic.13 polarization, and the interplay with other glial and neuronal subtypes. The study’s findings align with, but also refine, prior DAM/ARM models by providing human-specific, trajectory-resolved evidence and highlighting the importance of genetic context (APOE ε4). No explicit contradictions with prior models are discussed by the authors.

The identification of microglia-specific eQTLs and their colocalization with AD risk loci suggests potential therapeutic targets and biomarkers.

The identification of microglia-specific eQTLs for major AD risk genes (e.g., BIN1, EPHA1-AS1) aligns with and extends previous models of microglial involvement in neurodegeneration. The use of a multi-ancestry cohort addresses a critical gap in the field and suggests that ancestry-specific regulatory variants may underlie population differences in AD risk. Open questions remain regarding the functional consequences of these regulatory variants, the existence of finer microglial subtypes or states (e.g., DAM, homeostatic), and the interplay between dynamic regulation and disease onset. The lack of spatial or morphological validation of microglial subpopulations is a limitation, as is the focus on the prefrontal cortex. Future work should integrate multi-omic and spatial data, explore microglial heterogeneity in other brain regions, and experimentally validate candidate regulatory variants. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

However, the study does not report further subclustering, differential gene expression, or disease-associated states within the microglial population. The main immune cell findings relate to the presence of macrophages and immune oligodendroglia (imOLG), the latter expressing some microglial/immune markers (e.g., CD74, HLA.DRA, C3, PTPRC) and showing proximity to microglia in transcriptomic space.\n\nNo quantitative changes in microglial proportions between control and MS samples are reported, nor are there analyses of microglial activation states, marker gene shifts, or pathway enrichments specific to microglia. The immune cell cluster, including microglia, is noted to reflect immunological infiltration in MS, but the focus is on the oligodendrocyte lineage.\n\nThe only indirect microglial-related finding is the identification of imOLG, a population of oligodendroglia expressing immune genes (CD74, HLA.DRA, C3, PTPRC) and closely associated with microglia in tSNE space. This population is enriched in MS tissue and may represent a disease-associated state with immunological features, but it is not a microglial subtype per se.\n\nNo spatial, morphological, or temporal (pseudotime) analyses are presented for microglia.

The identification of microglia as a distinct cluster with canonical markers is consistent with prior single-cell/nucleus studies, but no new microglial subtypes or disease-associated states are described. The enrichment of immune oligodendroglia expressing microglial/immune genes in MS raises questions about glial plasticity and immune activation, but the functional relationship to microglia is not dissected here.\n\nOpen questions for microglia in MS—such as the existence of disease-associated microglial states, their transcriptional signatures, and their roles in demyelination or repair—remain unaddressed in this dataset.

The lack of discrete microglial subtypes in this dataset (e.g., homeostatic vs. disease-associated microglia) may reflect the relatively healthy status of the cohort or limitations in resolution, but the pronounced donor-specific activation signatures underscore the importance of accounting for baseline variability in future disease studies. The findings align with prior reports of microglial plasticity but extend them by quantifying the magnitude and sources of interindividual variation in a large, well-annotated cohort. Open questions include the environmental or genetic drivers of this variability, the functional consequences for brain health, and how these baseline states interact with disease processes. The study does not report contradictions with prior models but emphasizes the need for caution in attributing microglial activation solely to disease without considering normal variation.

(2021) investigates the role of CNS-homing T cells in the progression of multiple sclerosis (MS), using a combination of single-cell RNA sequencing, surface protein profiling, and spatial transcriptomics. The central hypothesis is that progressive MS may be driven by the accumulation and residence of pathogenic immune cells behind the blood-brain barrier, beyond the reach of current immunomodulatory therapies.\n\nThe study’s experimental design centers on the identification and characterization of a specific CD4+ T cell population (T09, CD161+/LTB+) in the blood and brains of MS patients. The authors use natalizumab treatment to trap CNS-homing cells in the blood, enabling their molecular profiling. They then track these cells in untreated MS patients and localize them in post-mortem brain tissue using spatial RNA sequencing.\n\n**Microglia:**\nDespite the comprehensive single-cell and spatial transcriptomic profiling, microglia are not a focus of the study. The authors do not report any findings regarding microglial heterogeneity, subtypes, or activation states in MS. Instead, microglia are referenced solely as a negative control in the validation of the T09 T cell signature. Specifically, the authors use a publicly available single-nucleus RNA-seq dataset (Schirmer et al., Nature 2019) to confirm that the T09 signature is not enriched in microglia or astrocytes, ensuring the specificity of their T cell findings.\n\nThere is no discussion of microglial marker genes, functional states (e.g., homeostatic, disease-associated), or their spatial distribution in MS lesions. The spatial transcriptomics analysis is focused on the localization of T09 T cells in white and gray matter, with no mention of microglial involvement or changes.\n\nThe absence of microglial findings is explicitly addressed in the methods and results, where the authors state that the T09 signature was tested and found not to be present in microglia or astrocytes. This serves to strengthen the specificity of their T cell-centric conclusions but does not provide new insights into microglial biology in MS.\n\n**Contradiction/Conflict:**  \nNo contradictions or departures from prior microglial data are discussed. The authors’ use of microglia as a negative control is consistent with existing knowledge of cell type-specific gene expression in the CNS. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Summary:**  \nIn summary, this study does not contribute new information on microglial subtypes, activation, or their role in MS. Microglia are only referenced to validate the specificity of T cell findings, and no microglia-focused analyses or results are presented.\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications (≈100–200 words):**  \nThe lack of microglial findings in this study highlights the specificity of the authors’ approach to dissecting peripheral immune cell contributions to MS progression. While the paper advances our understanding of CNS-homing T cells as potential therapeutic targets, it leaves open the question of how resident CNS cells, particularly microglia, interact with infiltrating lymphocytes and contribute to neurodegeneration in progressive MS. Future studies integrating high-resolution single-nucleus RNA-seq of brain tissue, with a focus on microglial heterogeneity and their crosstalk with T cells, will be essential to build a more complete picture of MS pathogenesis. The current study’s negative findings for microglia are consistent with its design and do not contradict existing models, but they underscore the need for dedicated microglia-centric investigations in MS. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

Nature Neuroscience. 2022 May;25(5):588–595. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41593-022-01061-1\nDisease focus: Parkinson’s disease (PD)\n</metadata>\n\n---\n\n**Quick Reference (≈100 words)**\n\nThis study used single-nucleus RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics to profile the human substantia nigra pars compacta (SNpc) in Parkinson’s disease, identifying 10 dopaminergic neuron subtypes and characterizing all major cell classes, including microglia. Among microglia, a GPNMB+ disease-associated subtype was proportionally increased in PD/LBD, paralleling findings in Alzheimer’s disease. This microglial activation was robust to sample size and technical variation, and was not the primary locus of PD genetic risk, which was instead concentrated in vulnerable DA neurons. The GPNMB+ microglia subtype was associated with neurodegeneration but not with specific genetic or demographic drivers.\n\n---\n\n**Detailed Summary (≈800–1000 words)**\n\n<methods>\nThe authors performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on postmortem human SNpc tissue from 8 neurotypical controls and 10 individuals with PD or Lewy body dementia (LBD), generating 387,483 nuclei profiles, including all major brain cell types. They also used Slide-seq spatial transcriptomics for anatomical localization. Microglia were identified and subclustered based on canonical markers. Validation included in situ hybridization and robust computational downsampling.\n</methods>\n\n<findings>\n**Cell Type Proportions:**  \nMicroglia were robustly identified among the seven major cell classes in the SNpc. In the disease (PD/LBD) versus control comparison, microglia as a broad class did not show the largest proportional change (that was observed in DA neurons), but a specific microglial subtype was significantly increased in PD/LBD.\n\n**Microglial Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  \nThe key microglial finding was the identification of a GPNMB+ microglia subtype (MG_GPNMB_SULT1C2), which was proportionally increased in PD/LBD compared to controls (<keyFinding priority='2'>). This subtype was defined by upregulation of GPNMB and SULT1C2, genes previously associated with disease-associated microglia (DAM) in Alzheimer’s disease (<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>). The increase in this subtype was robust to downsampling, remaining significant even when the dataset size was reduced to one-sixth of the original (<keyFinding priority='2'>). The authors note that GPNMB+ microglia have been repeatedly identified as markers of neurodegeneration-associated microglia in other neurodegenerative contexts, particularly AD (<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n\nOther microglial subtypes were identified but did not show significant proportional changes or disease associations.\n\n**Differential Gene Expression:**  \nThe GPNMB+ microglia subtype showed upregulation of GPNMB and SULT1C2, consistent with a DAM-like phenotype. The study did not report extensive differential expression analyses for other microglial subtypes.\n\n**Pathway Enrichment:**  \nWhile the paper does not provide a detailed pathway analysis for microglia, the upregulation of GPNMB and SULT1C2 is consistent with previously described DAM programs, which are associated with phagocytosis, lipid metabolism, and neuroinflammatory responses.\n\n**Spatial Analysis:**  \nSpatial transcriptomics (Slide-seq) was used primarily for DA neuron localization, not for microglia. No specific spatial or morphological validation of microglial subtypes was reported.\n\n**Modulators & Metrics:**  \nNo significant associations were reported between microglial subtypes and host or genetic factors (age, sex, APOE, or PD GWAS risk variants). The enrichment of PD heritability was not significant in microglia, in contrast to DA neurons (<keyFinding priority='1'> for DA neurons, not microglia; <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n\n**Gene Regulatory Networks:**  \nNo microglia-specific gene regulatory network analysis was reported.\n\n**Cell-Cell Communication:**  \nNo ligand-receptor or cell-cell communication analysis was performed for microglia.\n\n**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  \nNo pseudotime or trajectory analysis was reported for microglia.\n\n**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  \nPD GWAS risk was not enriched in microglial marker genes or subtypes, in contrast to findings in Alzheimer’s disease where microglia are a major locus of genetic risk (<contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>: The authors explicitly note that, unlike AD, PD heritability is not concentrated in microglia, but in DA neurons).\n\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nThe study suggests that microglial activation, particularly the expansion of a GPNMB+ DAM-like subtype, is a consistent feature of neurodegeneration in PD/LBD, paralleling similar findings in AD. However, the lack of PD genetic risk enrichment in microglia indicates that microglial activation is likely a secondary, non-cell-autonomous response to neuronal degeneration rather than a primary driver of disease (<keyFinding priority='2'>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>). This has implications for therapeutic strategies targeting microglia in PD, suggesting that such interventions may modulate disease progression or neuroinflammation but are unlikely to address the primary cause of neuronal loss.\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**\n\nThis study reinforces the concept that microglial activation, and specifically the emergence of a GPNMB+ DAM-like microglial state, is a conserved response to neurodegeneration across diseases, including PD and AD. However, the explicit lack of PD genetic risk enrichment in microglia, in contrast to AD, highlights a fundamental difference in disease mechanisms: in PD, microglial changes are likely reactive rather than causative. This finding aligns with prior models of DAM in AD but diverges in the genetic architecture of risk. Open questions remain regarding the functional consequences of GPNMB+ microglia in PD—whether they are neuroprotective, neurotoxic, or both at different stages—and whether modulating this state could alter disease progression. The study’s microglial subtypes are consistent with previously described DAM classifications, supporting the robustness of these states across diseases and platforms. Future work should address the temporal dynamics, spatial localization, and functional roles of microglial subtypes in PD, as well as their potential as biomarkers or therapeutic targets.\n\n<contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>: The authors explicitly discuss that, unlike in AD, PD genetic risk is not enriched in microglia, suggesting a cell-intrinsic vulnerability in DA neurons rather than a primary microglial etiology.\n\n---\n\n**Summary Table of Microglial Subtypes in PD (from this study):**\n\n| Subtype Name         | Marker Genes         | Disease Association | Functional Signature         | Genetic Risk Enrichment | Notes |\n|----------------------|---------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|-------|\n| MG_GPNMB_SULT1C2     | GPNMB, SULT1C2      | ↑ in PD/LBD         | DAM-like, neurodegeneration | None (PD)              | Robust to downsampling; parallels AD DAM |\n| Other microglia      | -                   | No change           | -                           | None                   | -     |\n\n---\n\n**Tag summary:**  \n- <keyFinding priority='2'>GPNMB+ microglia are increased in PD/LBD, paralleling AD DAM.</keyFinding>\n- <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> (robust, validated, consistent with prior studies)\n- <contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag> (explicitly discussed: PD risk is not enriched in microglia, unlike AD)"

Microglial cis-regulatory elements (cREs) are significantly associated with PD GWAS variants, and microglia-specific regulatory disruption is a key feature of the PD genetic landscape, particularly in individuals with risk alleles.\n\n---\n\n**Detailed Summary**\n\n<findings>\nThe authors performed single-nucleus transcriptomic and epigenomic profiling of the human substantia nigra, focusing on cell type–specific changes in PD. Microglia were identified using canonical markers (CD74, RUNX1) and analyzed for both transcriptional and regulatory alterations.\n\n**Cell Type Proportions and Disease Association**  \nMicroglia were robustly detected in both PD and control SN, with no explicit report of major proportional shifts between groups. However, microglia were highlighted as one of the key glial cell types with significant disease-associated molecular changes, alongside oligodendrocytes.\n\n**Differential Gene Expression and Pathway Enrichment**  \nMicroglia in PD showed upregulation of genes involved in immune response and autophagy, as well as downregulation of genes related to protein lipidation. Notably, several established PD risk genes (SNCA, LRRK2, VPS13C, GAK) were differentially expressed in microglia, indicating a strong disease association.  \n<keyFinding priority='1'>Microglia are a major site of PD-associated gene expression changes, including upregulation of immune and autophagy pathways and expression of multiple PD risk genes.</keyFinding>\n<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Microglial Subtypes and Functional States**  \nWhile the study does not provide a fine-grained subclustering of microglia into discrete subtypes (e.g., homeostatic vs. disease-associated microglia), it does identify microglia as a functionally distinct population with upregulated immune and autophagy signatures in PD.

The study’s LDSC regression analysis (Fig. 4A) shows that microglial cREs are among the most strongly enriched for PD heritability, second only to oligodendrocytes.  \n<keyFinding priority='1'>Microglial cREs are significantly enriched for PD GWAS variants, supporting a genetic contribution to microglial dysregulation in PD.</keyFinding>\n<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Dysregulated cREs and Target Genes**  \nThe integration of Hi-C and ABC modeling identified 223 microglia-specific target genes of dysregulated cREs and PD GWAS-SNPs. These genes are highly cell type–specific, with many being unique to microglia. Down-regulated cREs in microglia were particularly associated with genes involved in protein lipidation (e.g., MPPE1, ATG10, ZDHHC20), while up-regulated cREs were linked to autophagy and stress response genes (e.g., PTGES3, RUVBL2).  \n<keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial cREs dysregulated in PD preferentially target genes involved in protein lipidation and autophagy, implicating these pathways in microglial contribution to PD.</keyFinding>\n<confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Transcription Factor Motif Disruption**  \nMotif analysis revealed that microglia-enriched TFs (e.g., ZNF148) are frequently disrupted by PD GWAS-SNPs, with a bias toward loss of TF binding at risk alleles.

Disease associations were analyzed using compositional variation, differential gene expression (Dreamlet), mediation analysis, and trajectory inference (VAE-based pseudotime).\n</methods>\n\n---\n\n## 1) Quick Reference\n\nThe PsychAD atlas reveals that microglia in the human DLPFC display disease- and stage-specific transcriptomic changes across neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. In Alzheimer’s disease, microglial abundance increases with amyloid plaque burden and tau pathology, and microglial gene programs shift from homeostatic to lipid-droplet-accumulating, inflammatory, and phagocytic states, with key upregulated markers including DPYD, IL15, and PTPRG. These microglial responses are strongly modulated by AD polygenic risk and are implicated as aggravating factors in dementia progression.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Detailed Summary\n\n<findings>\nThe PsychAD study provides a comprehensive single-nucleus transcriptomic atlas of the human DLPFC, enabling systematic analysis of microglial heterogeneity and disease associations across a large, diverse cohort. Microglia are annotated as a distinct immune cell subclass within the unified taxonomy, validated by canonical marker expression and spatial transcriptomics (<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>).\n\n**Cell Type Proportions and Disease Associations:**  \nAcross neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs), including AD, DLBD, Vas, Tau, FTD, and PD, microglia show a significant increase in relative abundance compared to neurotypical controls (<keyFinding priority='1'>). This increase is most pronounced in AD and correlates with higher CERAD plaque scores and Braak tau stages (<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>). In contrast, neuropsychiatric disorders (NPDs) do not show a similar microglial expansion, highlighting disease specificity (<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n\n**Microglial Subtypes and States:**  \nWhile the primary taxonomy designates a single “Micro” subclass, the study’s trajectory and gene expression analyses reveal dynamic microglial state transitions along the AD pathological continuum. In early AD stages, microglia upregulate genes involved in innate immune activation, phagocytosis, and negative regulation of cell migration. As pathology advances, microglia increasingly express genes associated with lipid metabolism, lipid-droplet accumulation, and inflammatory responses (<keyFinding priority='1'>). Notably, late-stage microglial gene modules are highly enriched for AD GWAS risk loci, and also overlap with genetic risk for MS and PD (<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>).\n\n**Defining Marker Genes and Functional Programs:**  \nKey upregulated microglial genes in AD include DPYD, IL15, and PTPRG, all previously implicated in neuroinflammation and microglial activation (<keyFinding priority='2'>). Early-stage upregulation is seen for ACSL1, DPYD, and CD163, which are linked to a lipid-droplet-accumulating phenotype, especially in APOE4/4 carriers. Homeostatic microglial markers (CX3CR1, NAV2, P2RY12) are among the most strongly downregulated genes as tau pathology increases, indicating a loss of homeostatic identity and transition to disease-associated states (<keyFinding priority='1'>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>). These transitions are non-linear, with the greatest transcriptomic shifts occurring at intermediate Braak stages.\n\n**Pathway Enrichment:**  \nMicroglial DEGs in AD are enriched for pathways related to negative regulation of cell motility, migration, response to lipoprotein particles, phagocytosis, and adaptive immune activation (e.g., antigen presentation, T cell response). Early upregulation of innate immune and phagocytic pathways is followed by late upregulation of lipid metabolism and adaptive immune response genes (<keyFinding priority='2'>). These findings are supported by both pseudotime trajectory analysis and functional enrichment (GO BP, MF, CC) (<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>).\n\n**Disease Modulators and Mediation Analysis:**  \nMediation analysis demonstrates that microglial expansion and activation are downstream of AD polygenic risk and amyloid plaque accumulation, and in turn, microglial changes mediate increases in vascular leptomeningeal cells (VLMCs) and reductions in specific interneuron subtypes (IN_LAMP5_LHX6, IN_SST), both of which are associated with aggravated dementia (<keyFinding priority='1'>). Thus, microglia are positioned as key aggravating factors in the AD pathological cascade (<confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> due to cross-sectional design).\n\n**Gene Regulatory Networks and Cell-Cell Communication:**  \nWhile the study does not provide an explicit microglial regulon analysis, the enrichment of AD GWAS loci in late-stage microglial gene modules suggests that genetic risk converges on microglial regulatory programs. The study also implicates microglia in cross-talk with vascular and neuronal compartments, particularly through lipid metabolism and immune signaling pathways (<keyFinding priority='2'>, <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>).\n\n**Spatial and Morphological Validation:**  \nSpatial transcriptomics confirm the presence and distribution of microglia in the DLPFC, and the upregulation of disease-associated markers is validated at the transcript level. However, detailed morphological validation (e.g., immunostaining for lipid droplets) is not presented in this study (<keyFinding priority='3'>, <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>).\n\n**Aging and Disease Trajectories:**  \nTrajectory modeling reveals that microglial gene expression changes are highly non-linear across the AD continuum, with early innate immune activation and late lipid-droplet/inflammatory programs. These transitions are distinct from normal aging, supporting an AD-specific microglial response (<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n\n**Genetic and Multi-omic Integration:**  \nLate-stage microglial gene modules are significantly enriched for AD GWAS risk loci, and the overall microglial response is modulated by polygenic risk scores. The study does not report eQTLs specific to microglial subtypes but demonstrates strong genetic-transcriptomic concordance at the cell-class level (<keyFinding priority='1'>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>).\n\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nMicroglia emerge as central aggravating players in AD pathogenesis, with their expansion and activation tightly linked to amyloid and tau pathology and to genetic risk. The transition from homeostatic to lipid-droplet-accumulating, inflammatory states may exacerbate neurodegeneration and cognitive decline. These findings suggest that targeting microglial lipid metabolism or inflammatory signaling could represent therapeutic strategies, and that microglial gene signatures may serve as biomarkers for disease progression or treatment response. However, causal inferences are limited by the cross-sectional nature of the data, and further experimental validation is needed.\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n## 3) Research Implications\n\nThe PsychAD atlas establishes a robust framework for dissecting microglial heterogeneity and disease associations at population scale. The identification of non-linear, stage-specific microglial gene programs—particularly the late-stage lipid-droplet-accumulating and inflammatory states—aligns with recent models of microglial dysfunction in AD and supports the relevance of microglial-targeted interventions. The enrichment of AD GWAS risk loci in these microglial modules reinforces the genetic contribution to microglial pathogenicity.\n\nOpen questions include the precise molecular drivers of the microglial state transitions, the reversibility of the lipid-droplet phenotype, and the functional consequences for neuronal and vascular integrity. The study’s taxonomy is broadly concordant with prior single-cell atlases, but the explicit identification of microglial subtypes is limited to state transitions rather than discrete clusters, which may reflect the DLPFC region or technical resolution. No explicit contradictions with prior microglial classification schemes are discussed (<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n\nFuture work should focus on integrating spatial, morphological, and functional validation of microglial states, as well as longitudinal and experimental studies to clarify causality and therapeutic potential. The PsychAD resource will facilitate such investigations and cross-disease comparisons.\n\n---"

While H3K27ac ChIP-seq revealed strong concordance with gene expression changes, snATAC-seq did not identify significant differential chromatin accessibility peaks between C9-ALS and controls in microglia, likely due to technical limitations such as lower signal/noise and statistical power. <keyFinding priority='2'>snATAC-seq did not reveal significant differential chromatin accessibility in microglia, likely due to technical limitations.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nMicroglial transcriptional changes were present in both motor and frontal cortices, but the number of DEGs was lower than in astrocytes or oligodendrocytes.

However, the absence of distinct microglial subtypes or robust inflammatory signatures suggests that microglial activation in these diseases may be more limited or occur at earlier disease stages not captured in end-stage tissue. The findings raise important questions about the temporal dynamics of microglial activation in ALS/FTD and whether more pronounced or disease-specific microglial states might be detectable at earlier stages or with higher-resolution approaches. Future studies should aim to resolve microglial heterogeneity in ALS/FTD, integrate spatial transcriptomics, and link microglial states to genetic risk and clinical progression. The robust epigenetic-transcriptional coupling observed in microglia may inform future therapeutic strategies targeting microglial activation or chromatin remodeling in ALS/FTD.

The identification of CA microglia with iron-handling and complement activation signatures aligns with, but extends, previous models of disease-associated microglia (DAM) and rim-associated microglia (RAM) in MS and other neurodegenerative diseases. The spatially resolved cell-cell communication networks involving microglia, astrocytes, and endothelial cells suggest new mechanisms for lesion expansion and chronicity. Open questions include the precise functional roles of these microglial subtypes in lesion progression, their relationship to genetic risk factors, and whether targeting microglial-astrocyte or microglial-endothelial interactions can halt or reverse chronic lesion activity.

Nuclei were assigned to major cell types (glutamatergic neurons, GABAergic neurons, astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, polydendrocytes, microglia, endothelial cells) and subtypes using established marker genes and computational clustering. Latent factor analysis (PEER) and consensus non-negative matrix factorization (cNMF) were used to identify multicellular gene-expression programs. Cell-type proportions and gene expression were compared across age, disease status, and other covariates.\n</methods>\n\n<findings>\n**Cell Type Proportions:**  \nMicroglia comprised approximately 3.6% of all nuclei (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Fig. 1). The study explicitly states that each donor contributed nuclei of all major cell types, including microglia, and that subsequent analyses excluded samples with atypical cell-type proportions. However, neither schizophrenia nor age was associated with significant variation in the relative abundance of microglia (see Extended Data Fig. 1d, Supplementary Fig. 1c,d). <keyFinding priority='3'>No significant changes in microglial proportions with disease or age.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Differential Gene Expression & Pathway Enrichment:**  \nThe central finding of the paper is the identification of a multicellular gene-expression program (SNAP: Synaptic Neuron and Astrocyte Program) that is co-regulated in neurons and astrocytes, and declines in both aging and schizophrenia. This program is defined by synaptic and cholesterol biosynthesis genes in neurons and astrocytes, respectively.  \nMicroglia do **not** contribute to the SNAP program: among the 1,000 gene/cell-type expression traits with the strongest SNAP (LF4) loadings, 99% involved neurons or astrocytes, with only a negligible microglial component (Fig. 1g).

Microglia are treated as a single, relatively homogeneous population in this dataset. No disease-associated microglial (DAM) or other activation states are described. Extended Data Fig. 7a shows that microglial expression of cholesterol biosynthesis genes is minimal and unchanged in schizophrenia. <keyFinding priority='3'>No evidence for disease- or age-associated microglial subtypes or activation states.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Modulators & Metrics:**  \nNo significant modulation of microglial gene expression or proportion by age, sex, schizophrenia status, or other covariates is reported.

The focus of cell-cell communication and regulatory analysis is on neuron–astrocyte interactions.\n\n**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  \nTemporal modeling and pseudotime analyses are not applied to microglia, as no dynamic or disease-associated microglial states are detected.\n\n**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**  \nNo integration of microglial gene expression with schizophrenia GWAS or other genetic risk factors is reported. The genetic enrichment analyses focus on neuron- and astrocyte-expressed genes.\n\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>  \nThe authors do not discuss any contradictions between their microglial findings and prior literature. They do not report any evidence for microglial activation or disease association, in contrast to some previous studies in other brain regions or disorders, but this is not explicitly discussed as a contradiction.\n\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\n**Disease-specific roles:**  \nThe study concludes that microglia are not primary participants in the multicellular gene-expression program (SNAP) that declines in schizophrenia and aging. There is no evidence from this dataset that microglia contribute to, or respond to, the synaptic or metabolic changes observed in neurons and astrocytes in the dlPFC in these conditions.\n\n**Mechanistic insights:**  \nNo mechanistic role for microglia in schizophrenia or age-related cortical pathology is suggested by these data. The absence of microglial activation or subtype expansion implies that microglia are not major drivers or responders in the molecular pathology captured by this study.\n\n**Therapeutic or biomarker implications:**  \nMicroglial markers or states are not proposed as therapeutic targets or biomarkers for schizophrenia or age-related cognitive decline in this context.\n\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**\n\nThe absence of significant microglial transcriptional or proportional changes in this large, well-powered human snRNA-seq study of dlPFC suggests that, at least in this cortical region and in the context of schizophrenia and normal aging, microglia do not undergo major disease- or age-associated state transitions. This finding contrasts with reports of disease-associated microglial (DAM) states in neurodegenerative disorders or in other brain regions, but the authors do not explicitly discuss such discrepancies. The results imply that microglial activation is not a universal feature of cortical pathology in schizophrenia or aging, and that neuron–astrocyte interactions are more central to the molecular changes observed here. Open questions remain regarding whether microglial responses might be more prominent in other brain regions, at earlier disease stages, or in response to different pathologies. Future studies could apply more sensitive or spatially resolved approaches to detect subtle microglial heterogeneity or rare states. The lack of microglial involvement in the SNAP program also suggests that therapeutic strategies targeting microglia may not be effective for the synaptic and metabolic deficits described in schizophrenia and aging in the dlPFC. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

Microglia accounted for ~3% of nuclei, with no significant change in overall proportion between ALS and controls.\n\n**Cell Type Proportions:**  \nThere was no significant expansion or depletion of microglia in ALS cortex compared to controls (<keyFinding priority='3'>No major change in microglial abundance</keyFinding>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n\n**Microglial Subtype Identification & Characterization:**  \nUnbiased clustering of 1,452 microglial nuclei revealed three subclusters:\n- **Micro0:** Homeostatic microglia, expressing P2RY12, CX3CR1, IRF8.\n- **Micro1:** DAM-like (disease-associated microglia), upregulated in ALS, expressing CTSD, SPP1, TREM2, SQSTM1/p62, GRN, LRRK2, APOE, CPM, GPNMB, ASAH1, ITGAX, LGALS3, and downregulating homeostatic markers.\n- **Micro2:** Cycling microglia, minor population.\n\nThe DAM-like Micro1 state was significantly enriched in ALS samples, while homeostatic Micro0 was relatively depleted (<keyFinding priority='1'>ALS cortex is dominated by a DAM-like microglial state with upregulation of endolysosomal and inflammatory genes</keyFinding>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n\n**Differential Gene Expression:**  \nALS microglia showed upregulation of genes involved in:\n- Endolysosomal/vesicle trafficking: CTSD, SQSTM1/p62, GRN, LRRK2, ASAH1, LGALS3, SPP1, GPNMB, TREM2, OPTN.\n- Lipid metabolism: APOE, APOC1.\n- Inflammatory response: ITGAX, CPM, CD68.\n- Downregulation of homeostatic genes: P2RY12, CX3CR1, IRF8.\n\nThese changes were robust to individual outlier exclusion and consistent across patients (<keyFinding priority='1'>ALS microglia upregulate endolysosomal, lipid metabolism, and inflammatory genes while downregulating homeostatic markers</keyFinding>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n\n**Pathway Enrichment:**  \nGO analysis confirmed enrichment for endocytosis, exocytosis, lysosomal function, vesicle trafficking, myeloid activation, and degranulation pathways in ALS microglia. These pathways are linked to neurodegeneration and are distinct from those upregulated in AD or MS microglia (<keyFinding priority='2'>ALS microglial activation is characterized by endolysosomal and vesicle trafficking pathways, not classical immune activation</keyFinding>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n\n**Cell-Cell Communication & Modulators:**  \nThe DAM-like state was partially recapitulated in vitro by exposing iPSC-derived microglia to apoptotic neurons, which induced upregulation of lysosomal and DAM genes (CTSD, ITGAX, LGALS3, SQSTM1/p62) and downregulation of homeostatic genes, suggesting that neuronal stress/apoptosis is a key driver (<keyFinding priority='2'>Neuronal apoptosis induces DAM-like gene expression in microglia</keyFinding>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n\nConnectivity Map analysis suggested that the ALS microglial signature is positively correlated with cell cycle/senescence regulators and negatively with type I interferon responses, indicating possible exhaustion of proliferative capacity and a distinct inflammatory profile.\n\n**Comparisons to Other Diseases:**  \nThe ALS DAM-like signature overlaps partially with DAM states in AD and MS (e.g., TREM2, APOE, GPNMB, SPP1), but ALS-specific upregulation of vesicle trafficking and lysosomal genes (SQSTM1/p62, GRN, LRRK2, ASAH1) distinguishes it from other neurodegenerative conditions (<keyFinding priority='2'>ALS microglial activation shares features with but is molecularly distinct from AD/MS DAM states</keyFinding>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>, <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>).\n\n**Spatial/Morphological Validation:**  \nNo direct spatial or morphological validation of microglial subtypes was reported in this study.\n\n**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  \nNo explicit pseudotime or trajectory analysis for microglia was performed, but the DAM-like state is interpreted as a disease-associated activation rather than an aging phenomenon.\n\n**Genetic/Multi-omic Integration:**  \nSeveral upregulated microglial genes (TREM2, GRN, SQSTM1, OPTN) are known ALS–FTD risk genes, suggesting genetic convergence on this reactive state.\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nThe study implicates microglia as key mediators of ALS cortical pathology, with a shift from homeostatic to DAM-like, endolysosomal/inflammatory states. This microglial activation is likely driven by neuronal stress and apoptosis, and may contribute to neurodegeneration via impaired clearance, altered lipid metabolism, and chronic inflammation. The distinct molecular profile of ALS microglia (relative to AD/MS) suggests that targeting endolysosomal and vesicle trafficking pathways, or modulating DAM-like activation, could represent novel therapeutic strategies. The overlap with genetic risk factors further supports microglia as a potential biomarker and intervention point in ALS.\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications**\n\nThis study provides strong evidence that ALS microglia adopt a DAM-like, endolysosomal/inflammatory state, distinct from homeostatic microglia and from DAMs in AD/MS. The upregulation of genes such as CTSD, SPP1, TREM2, SQSTM1/p62, and GRN aligns with known ALS–FTD risk loci, suggesting genetic convergence on this reactive phenotype. The partial recapitulation of this state by neuronal apoptosis in vitro supports a model where microglial activation is secondary to neuronal injury, but may also exacerbate disease progression.\n\nOpen questions include whether this DAM-like state is neuroprotective or deleterious in ALS, how it evolves over disease course, and whether it can be modulated therapeutically. The lack of major microglial subtype expansion (as seen in some AD studies) suggests that functional reprogramming, rather than proliferation, is the dominant response in ALS cortex. Future studies should address spatial localization, longitudinal dynamics, and the impact of genetic modifiers (e.g., C9orf72, TREM2 variants) on microglial states. The findings are consistent with, but extend beyond, prior DAM frameworks by highlighting endolysosomal and vesicle trafficking as central to ALS microglial pathology.\n\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

Microglial state transitions are more strongly determined by patient-specific factors than by lesion type, with reactive subtypes (Micro_C–E) increased in active and chronic lesions, and homeostatic microglia (Micro_A/B) reduced. No single microglial signature defines lesion subtypes; instead, coordinated multicellular stress and immune programs stratify patients, with microglial activation correlating with oligodendrocyte and astrocyte responses.

Samples included various lesion types (active, chronic active, chronic inactive, remyelinated, normal-appearing WM/GM) and were processed with rigorous QC, batch correction, and clustering. Subtype identification was validated by marker gene expression and spatial analysis; findings were replicated in an independent cohort and by RNAscope in situ hybridization.\n</methods>\n\n<findings>\n**Cell Type Proportions and Disease Association**\nMicroglia were divided into seven subclusters, with Micro_A and Micro_B representing homeostatic microglia (P2RY12+, CX3CR1+), and Micro_C–E representing reactive/disease-associated states (TREM2+, APOE+, GPNMB+, IL1B+). Perivascular macrophages (PVMs, MARCO+, LYVE1+) and a proliferative microglia cluster were also identified.\n\nIn MS white matter, there is a shift from homeostatic microglia (Micro_A/B) toward reactive subtypes (Micro_C–E), particularly in active (AL) and chronic active (CAL) lesions. Homeostatic microglia are reduced, while Micro_C (stress/chaperone markers: HSPA6, HIF1A), Micro_D (GPNMB, MITF), and Micro_E (IL1B, CCL3) are increased. These reactive subtypes resemble previously described DAM/MIMS states in neurodegeneration and MS. <keyFinding priority='1'>The increase in reactive microglia is a hallmark of MS lesions, but the magnitude and specific subtype composition vary between patients more than between lesion types.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Differential Gene Expression and Pathways**\nMicroglial subtypes are defined by distinct marker genes:\n- Micro_A/B: P2RY12, CX3CR1 (homeostatic, downregulated in lesions)\n- Micro_C: HSPA6, HIF1A (stress/chaperone response)\n- Micro_D: GPNMB, MITF (DAM/MIMS-like, upregulated in lesions)\n- Micro_E: IL1B, CCL3 (pro-inflammatory, upregulated in lesions)\n\nPathway analysis shows upregulation of stress response, chaperone, and inflammatory genes in reactive microglia, with downregulation of homeostatic markers. <keyFinding priority='2'>These changes are consistent across lesion types, suggesting a global microglial response to MS pathology rather than lesion-specific programs.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Subtype Characterization and Disease Progression**\n- Micro_A/B (homeostatic): Predominant in control and normal-appearing WM, reduced in AL/CAL.\n- Micro_C (stress): Increased in AL/CAL, expresses chaperone and hypoxia markers.\n- Micro_D (DAM/MIMS-like): Increased in lesions, expresses GPNMB, MITF; similar to microglial states in AD and other neurodegenerative diseases.\n- Micro_E (pro-inflammatory): Increased in lesions, expresses IL1B, CCL3.\n- PVMs: Present but not expanded in MS lesions.\n\nNo evidence for a single \"MS-specific\" microglial state; instead, a spectrum of activation states is observed, with patient identity explaining most variance. <keyFinding priority='1'>Patient-specific factors, rather than lesion type, are the dominant determinant of microglial gene expression and subtype composition.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Modulators and Metrics**\nAge, sex, MS subtype, and post-mortem interval do not explain microglial heterogeneity. Instead, patient identity is the strongest modulator, as shown by hierarchical clustering and MOFA factor analysis. <keyFinding priority='1'>Microglial activation states are coordinated with oligodendrocyte and astrocyte responses, forming multicellular programs that stratify patients into distinct pathological subgroups.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Spatial and Morphological Validation**\nRNAscope in situ hybridization confirmed upregulation of key microglial markers (e.g., HSP90AA1, NAMPT) in MS lesions, correlating with MOFA factor scores. <keyFinding priority='2'>Spatial validation supports the existence of distinct microglial activation states in MS white matter.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Aging/Disease Trajectories**\nNo evidence for a simple trajectory from homeostatic to reactive microglia based on lesion stage; instead, microglial states are distributed according to patient-specific factors, suggesting stable, individual-specific activation profiles.\n\n**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration**\nNo direct link to genetic risk variants or eQTLs for microglial subtypes is reported in this study.\n\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nMicroglia in MS white matter undergo a shift from homeostatic to reactive states, but the pattern and extent of activation are determined more by patient-specific factors than by lesion type or clinical variables. This suggests that microglial responses are part of coordinated multicellular programs that define pathological subgroups of MS patients. While reactive microglia may contribute to demyelination and neurodegeneration, their precise mechanistic role remains associative. The identification of patient-specific microglial activation profiles has potential implications for precision medicine, as therapies targeting microglial activation may need to be tailored to individual pathological patterns rather than lesion categories. Microglial markers validated by RNAscope may serve as candidate biomarkers for patient stratification.\n</clinical>\n\nResearch Implications\n\nThis study challenges the traditional view that microglial activation in MS is primarily determined by lesion type or stage. Instead, it demonstrates that microglial heterogeneity is dominated by patient-specific factors, with reactive subtypes (DAM/MIMS-like, stress, pro-inflammatory) variably expanded across individuals. The microglial subtypes identified here align with previously described DAM/MIMS states in MS and other neurodegenerative diseases, supporting the generalizability of these activation programs. However, the lack of a single \"MS-specific\" microglial state and the absence of clear lesion-stage trajectories suggest that microglial responses are embedded within broader, multicellular pathological programs.\n\nOpen questions include the molecular drivers of patient-specific microglial activation, the functional consequences of different microglial states for demyelination and repair, and the potential for peripheral biomarkers to capture CNS microglial pathology. The study's findings support a move toward precision medicine in MS, where microglial (and glial) activation profiles could inform patient stratification and therapeutic targeting. Future work should integrate genetic, proteomic, and longitudinal data to clarify the stability and clinical relevance of microglial subtypes, and to resolve whether similar patient-specific patterns exist in other neurodegenerative diseases. No explicit contradictions with prior models are discussed; rather, the study extends and refines current understanding of microglial heterogeneity in MS.\n\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

Open questions include whether this activation state is neuroprotective, deleterious, or context-dependent, and how it evolves over disease progression. The lack of discrete microglial subtypes in this dataset may reflect limitations of snRNA-seq or true biological homogeneity in the disease context. Future studies should integrate spatial transcriptomics, longitudinal sampling, and functional assays to dissect the causal roles of microglial activation in AD.

The findings imply that microglial dysfunction in females may contribute to altered neuronal signaling and synaptic regulation, potentially underlying sex differences in depression risk and symptomatology.

The upregulation of neuronal and ion channel genes, alongside downregulation of both pro- and anti-inflammatory pathways, suggests a non-canonical microglial activation state in female depression. Open questions include whether these changes reflect altered microglial-neuronal communication, hormonal modulation, or unique stress responses. The absence of distinct disease-associated microglial subtypes (e.g., DAM) and the lack of spatial/morphological validation are notable limitations. Future work should integrate spatial transcriptomics, protein-level validation, and genetic risk mapping to clarify the causal role and therapeutic potential of microglia in sex-specific depression mechanisms. The findings are consistent with, but extend, prior models of microglial involvement in psychiatric disease, and do not contradict established neurodegenerative microglial paradigms. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

Open questions include the causal role of MG2 in neurodegeneration versus protection, the reversibility of MG2 activation, and the precise triggers (amyloid, tau, vascular, or systemic) for microglial state transitions. The strong sex effect on microglial activation in DSAD warrants further study.

The cohort included 12 male individuals with schizophrenia and 14 male controls. The analysis identified 20 transcriptomically distinct cell populations, encompassing both neuronal and glial cell types, including microglia. Downstream analyses included differential gene expression, pathway enrichment, and regulatory network inference.\n</methods>\n\n<findings>\nThe principal finding of this study is that schizophrenia-associated transcriptomic alterations are highly cell type-specific and overwhelmingly concentrated in neuronal populations. Out of 4,766 differential expression events (2,994 unique genes across 16 of 20 cell populations), approximately 96% were localized to five neuronal cell types. These neuronal subtypes showed enrichment for genes associated with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder GWAS loci, as well as cluster-specific gene ontologies and canonical pathways.\n\nIn contrast, microglia—while identified as a distinct cell population—did not exhibit significant differential gene expression between schizophrenia and control samples. The study does not report the identification of multiple microglial subtypes or states (such as homeostatic, disease-associated, or inflammatory microglia) within the DLPFC. There is no mention of microglial subpopulation expansion, contraction, or unique marker gene signatures associated with schizophrenia. Furthermore, the authors do not describe any significant changes in microglial cell proportions or activation markers, nor do they report spatial or morphological validation of microglial states.\n\n<keyFinding priority='2'>The absence of substantial microglial transcriptomic changes suggests that, within the DLPFC and under the conditions studied, microglia do not play a prominent role in the cell type-specific molecular pathology of schizophrenia.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> (supported by large sample size and comprehensive cell type annotation). <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nThe authors do not discuss modulators such as age, sex, or genetic risk factors specifically in relation to microglia, nor do they report microglia-specific pathway enrichment, gene regulatory networks, or cell-cell communication findings. The study’s focus on neuronal subtypes is reinforced by the lack of microglial involvement in the major differentially expressed gene sets and pathways.\n\nNo temporal modelling, pseudotime analysis, or disease progression trajectories are reported for microglia. Similarly, there is no integration of genetic risk (e.g., eQTLs) or multi-omic data specifically linking microglial states to schizophrenia risk variants.\n\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> The authors do not explicitly discuss any contradictions or departures from prior models regarding microglial involvement in schizophrenia.

This suggests that microglial activation or dysfunction may not be a primary driver of molecular pathology in this brain region or disease stage, or that such changes are below the detection threshold of the current approach. <keyFinding priority='2'>Microglia are unlikely to serve as robust biomarkers or therapeutic targets for schizophrenia based on transcriptomic signatures in the DLPFC.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications**\n\nThe lack of significant microglial transcriptomic alterations in this large-scale snRNA-seq study of schizophrenia DLPFC raises important questions about the regional and temporal specificity of microglial involvement in psychiatric disorders. While animal models and some human studies have implicated microglial activation in schizophrenia, this dataset suggests that, at least in the adult DLPFC, microglia do not display distinct disease-associated states or marker gene changes. Future research should address whether microglial alterations are more prominent in other brain regions, developmental stages, or in response to environmental or genetic risk factors not captured in this cohort. Additionally, more sensitive approaches (e.g., spatial transcriptomics, proteomics, or functional assays) may be required to detect subtle or transient microglial changes. The findings also highlight the importance of cell type- and region-specific analyses in neuropsychiatric disease research. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> (as the authors do not explicitly discuss conflicts with prior microglial models, though the results may contrast with some expectations in the field)."

After clustering, 26 distinct cell populations were identified, including a \"Micro/Macro\" cluster defined by expression of microglial markers (SPI1, MRC1, TMEM119, CX3CR1). The cluster likely included both microglia and perivascular macrophages, but the majority of cells expressed canonical microglial genes.

The MG4 subcluster was significantly enriched in R47H-TREM2 carriers compared to CV-TREM2 (P = 0.048), while other subclusters showed no genotype-specific differences.

R47H-hTREM2 increased the proportion of cluster 2 microglia in tauopathy, with upregulation of DAM genes (Clec7a, Ctsb, Axl, Apoe, Cd63, Cst7) and interferon response genes (Irf7, Ifih1, Ifitm3, Mx1, Ifi44, Ifit3).

In vivo, chronic AKT inhibition abolished the tauopathy-induced MG4 subcluster and rescued synaptic loss in R47H-hTREM2 tauopathy mice. <keyFinding priority='1'>AKT hyperactivation is necessary for the maintenance of the R47H-associated proinflammatory microglial state and its disease-enhancing effects.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n**Homeostatic Microglia**\n\nMG1 was identified as the homeostatic microglial cluster, enriched in nontransgenic and wild-type mice, and reduced in R47H-hTREM2 tauopathy mice.

Sex was a strong modulator of microglial response and disease phenotype, with females showing greater vulnerability to R47H-induced inflammatory activation and cognitive deficits.\n\n**Contradictions and Context**\n\nThe authors note that heterozygous R47H does not phenocopy complete TREM2 deficiency, which blocks DAM induction. Instead, R47H enhances DAM-like states and inflammation, particularly in females. This is contrasted with prior mouse studies using homozygous R47H or TREM2 knockout, which show different effects on amyloid and tau pathology. <contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag> (Explicitly discussed: R47H heterozygosity enhances, rather than blocks, DAM-like activation, in contrast to TREM2 knockout.)\n\n</Detailed Summary>\n\n<clinical>\nThe R47H-TREM2 variant drives a unique, disease-enhancing microglial state (MG4/DAM-like) with heightened proinflammatory and AKT signaling signatures in AD. This state is associated with worsened cognitive deficits and synaptic loss in tauopathy, especially in females, and is not due to increased tau pathology per se. Pharmacological inhibition of AKT reverses these microglial changes and rescues synaptic integrity, suggesting that AKT is a promising therapeutic target for modulating microglial responses in R47H-TREM2 AD. The findings highlight the importance of genetic and sex-specific factors in microglial-mediated neurodegeneration and suggest that microglial subtypes may serve as biomarkers or therapeutic targets in AD, particularly in genetically at-risk populations.\n</clinical>\n\n<Research Implications>\nThis study establishes that the R47H-TREM2 variant selectively expands a DAM-like, proinflammatory microglial subpopulation (MG4) in human AD and mouse tauopathy, driven by AKT hyperactivation. The MG4 state shares features with previously described DAM/MGnD microglia but is uniquely enhanced by R47H and modulated by sex. These findings align with, but also extend, prior models by showing that R47H does not block but rather exaggerates DAM-like activation, in contrast to TREM2 knockout. Open questions include the precise mechanisms by which AKT signaling sustains the MG4 state, the role of APOE genotype, and the relevance of these findings to other AD risk alleles. Future work should address the isoform-specific roles of AKT, the impact of human APOE isoforms, and the potential for AKT-targeted therapies in genetically defined AD subgroups. The study’s integration of human and mouse data strengthens confidence in the translational relevance of the MG4 microglial state as a disease driver and therapeutic target.\n</Research Implications>"

Over 200,000 nuclei were profiled, with cell type and subtype annotation validated by reference mapping and marker gene expression. Differential expression and chromatin accessibility analyses were performed using NEBULA, with integration of GWAS, cCRE, and TF motif data. No significant changes in microglial proportions were observed between PD and controls.\n</methods>\n\n<findings>\n**Cell Type Proportions and General Features**\nMicroglia were identified as one of six major cell types, further subdivided into three clusters: Micro1, Micro2, and Micro3. The majority of microglial nuclei belonged to Micro1. No significant differences in overall microglial abundance or in the proportions of microglial subtypes were detected between PD and control samples (<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>).\n\n**Microglial Subtypes and Disease Associations**\n- **Micro1**: This was the dominant microglial subtype. It exhibited the highest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) among all cell subtypes in the dataset (n=5640), with a strong polarization toward downregulation in PD (<keyFinding priority='1'>). Key downregulated genes included those involved in immune response, DNA damage response, chromatin organization, and cellular recycling. Pathway analysis revealed suppression of microglia-specific immune pathways and stress-responsive functions, including DNA repair and apoptosis regulation (<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>). Micro1 also showed the strongest enrichment for downregulated PD GWAS-DEGs among all clusters, suggesting a prominent role in disease-associated gene suppression (<keyFinding priority='1'>). Notably, the familial PD gene PRKN was differentially expressed in microglia, and LRRK2 was a DEG in microglia and OPCs.\n- **Micro2**: This cluster also showed enrichment for downregulated pathways, but with fewer DEGs than Micro1. The directionality of gene expression changes was consistent with Micro1, supporting a general suppression of microglial immune and stress response functions in PD (<keyFinding priority='2'>).\n- **Micro3**: This minor cluster contained a small proportion of microglial nuclei and was less well characterized due to low abundance. It was noted to contain some DEGs, including familial PD genes such as DJ-1 (PARK7) and PINK1, but the biological significance was not deeply explored (<confidenceLevel>low</confidenceLevel>).\n\n**Differential Gene Expression and Pathways**\n- Microglial DEGs in PD were predominantly downregulated and enriched for pathways related to DNA damage response, chromatin organization, apoptosis regulation, and immune signaling (e.g., interferon, cytokine, and complement pathways). This suggests a suppression of canonical microglial activation and stress response programs in the temporal cortex during PD progression (<keyFinding priority='1'>, <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>).\n- Downregulated PD GWAS-DEGs in microglia were enriched for diverse categories including DNA metabolism, immune response, mitochondrial organization, and vesicle transport. This pattern was most prominent in Micro1 and OPC1 clusters.\n\n**Chromatin Accessibility and Regulatory Mechanisms**\n- Microglial clusters showed a predominance of differentially accessible peaks (DAPs) with increased accessibility in PD, but relatively few DAPs overlapped with DEGs of matching directionality, suggesting that open chromatin sites may often affect distal rather than proximal genes (<keyFinding priority='2'>, <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>).\n- Integration of snATAC-seq and snRNA-seq identified cis-coaccessibility networks (CCANs) and candidate cis-regulatory elements (cCREs) linked to microglial DEGs, including those within PD GWAS loci.\n- Motif enrichment analysis revealed that downregulated PD GWAS-DEGs in Micro1 were predicted to be regulated by large networks of differentially expressed transcription factors (TF-DEGs), with YY1, SP3, and KLF16 highlighted as potential master regulators (<keyFinding priority='2'>, <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>).\n\n**Genetic Modulators and Variant Effects**\n- Several regulatory variants in high linkage disequilibrium (LD) with PD GWAS SNPs were identified within cCREs of microglial PD GWAS-DEGs, predicted to alter TF binding affinities (e.g., for YY1, SP3, KLF16, and others). These findings suggest that non-coding genetic variation may contribute to microglial gene dysregulation in PD (<keyFinding priority='1'>, <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel>).\n\n**Morphological/Spatial Validation**\n- No direct morphological or spatial validation of microglial subtypes was reported.\n\n**Aging/Disease Trajectories**\n- The study focused on temporal cortex samples with minimal to mild pathology, suggesting that observed microglial gene expression changes may represent early or pre-neurodegenerative stages of PD progression in this region.\n\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nMicroglia in the temporal cortex of PD patients exhibit a pronounced suppression of immune response, DNA repair, and stress-response pathways, particularly within the dominant Micro1 subtype. This downregulation is strongly associated with PD GWAS loci and may reflect an impaired ability of microglia to respond to cellular stress or maintain genomic integrity during disease progression. The identification of regulatory variants and TF networks (notably involving YY1, SP3, and KLF16) suggests that microglial dysfunction in PD may be driven by both genetic and epigenetic mechanisms. While these findings are associative, they implicate microglial gene regulatory networks as potential contributors to PD pathogenesis and highlight candidate targets for therapeutic intervention or biomarker development. However, the absence of overt microglial activation or proliferation in this cortical region suggests that microglial dysfunction may precede or differ from classical neuroinflammatory responses observed in other brain regions or later disease stages.\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**\nMicroglia in the temporal cortex of Parkinson’s disease (PD) patients, especially the dominant Micro1 subtype, show extensive downregulation of genes involved in immune response, DNA repair, and stress pathways, with strong enrichment for PD GWAS loci. This suppression is linked to regulatory networks involving TFs such as YY1, SP3, and KLF16, and is modulated by non-coding variants in high LD with PD risk alleles. No significant changes in microglial abundance or proliferation were observed, suggesting early or pre-neurodegenerative dysfunction rather than classical activation.\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications (≈150 words):**\nThis study provides a detailed multi-omic map of microglial gene regulatory changes in the temporal cortex during PD, revealing a unique pattern of suppressed immune and stress-response pathways rather than overt activation. The strong association with PD GWAS loci and regulatory variants suggests that microglial dysfunction may be genetically programmed and could act as an early driver or permissive factor in cortical PD progression. The identification of master TFs (YY1, SP3, KLF16) and their regulatory networks offers new avenues for mechanistic studies and potential therapeutic targeting. Notably, the observed microglial states differ from the pro-inflammatory or disease-associated microglia (DAM) described in Alzheimer’s disease and other neurodegenerative models, indicating disease- and region-specific microglial responses. Future work should address whether these suppressed microglial programs are reversible, their impact on neuronal vulnerability, and how they interact with other glial and neuronal subtypes during PD progression. No explicit contradictions with prior microglial classification schemes were discussed by the authors."

The identification of phagocytosing microglia/macrophages by the presence of myelin-derived transcripts is a novel approach, validated both in situ and in vitro, and may be applicable to other demyelinating or neurodegenerative conditions. The spatial restriction of activated microglia to lesion rims underscores the importance of microenvironmental cues in shaping microglial states. Open questions remain regarding the functional consequences of prolonged microglial activation and iron accumulation—whether these states are neurotoxic, reparative, or context-dependent. The study does not directly address genetic or environmental modulators of microglial phenotypes, nor does it resolve whether similar subtypes exist in early MS or in response to therapy. The findings are largely consistent with prior models of microglial activation in MS, but the explicit demonstration of myelin mRNA uptake as a marker of phagocytosis is a significant advance. Future work should address the temporal dynamics, reversibility, and therapeutic modulation of these microglial states in MS and related disorders. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

Showed increased representation with higher amyloid-β and pTau burden. This cluster was also enriched for DAM (disease-associated microglia), ARM (activated response microglia), and IRM (interferon response microglia) gene sets, though these signatures were not exclusive to Micro2. <keyFinding priority='1'>Micro2 is the principal disease-associated microglial state, showing upregulation of AD risk genes (APOE, MS4A6A, PILRA), phagocytosis, autophagy, and inflammatory pathways in association with pathology.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n- **Micro3 (Dystrophic/Low-activity):** Characterized by low expression of both homeostatic and activation genes, but higher C3 and LPAR6.

These genes are involved in lipid metabolism, autophagy, phagocytosis, and inflammation.\n- **Pathways:** Enrichment for selective autophagy, microglial pathogen phagocytosis, proteostasis, and complement activation (see Fig. 4). IL1-related pathways were specifically enriched with pTau.\n- **Downregulated Genes:** TLR2, TLR10, HK2, JAK2, ITGAM (CD11b) were among the few genes negatively associated with pathology.\n\n**Gene Co-expression Networks and Regulons**\n- **APOE as a Hub:** APOE was a central hub in a microglial module (module 19) co-expressed with TREM2, complement, and inflammatory genes, functionally enriched for phagocytosis and antigen presentation. <keyFinding priority='1'>APOE is a key hub in disease-associated microglial networks, linking phagocytic, complement, and inflammatory pathways.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n- **GPNMB Module:** GPNMB was a hub in modules 11 and 34, both upregulated with amyloid-β and pTau, and enriched for lipid homeostasis, autophagy, and lysosomal function. GPNMB expression was validated by immunohistochemistry, showing increased density in AD cortex (mean ~1.8-fold increase vs. controls; Fig. 5b,c). <keyFinding priority='1'>GPNMB is a robust marker of disease-associated microglia and PVMs, validated at the protein level, and is linked to lipid metabolism and autophagy.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n- **Transcriptional Regulators:** MAFG, MITF, JUND, CEBPA, CEBPD, and PBX3 regulons were upregulated in disease-associated microglia.\n\n**Cell-Cell Communication**\n- Increased APP (astrocyte)–CD74 (microglia) and complement (C3/C4A–C3AR1) ligand-receptor interactions with pathology, suggesting enhanced cross-talk in AD.\n\n**Spatial/Morphological Validation**\n- GPNMB immunostaining confirmed increased microglial and PVM expression in AD cortex, correlating with snRNA-seq module expression and local pTau/amyloid-β burden.\n\n**Aging/Disease Trajectories**\n- Micro2 and PVM subclusters increased in proportion with greater amyloid-β and pTau pathology, suggesting a shift from homeostatic to disease-associated states with disease progression.\n\n**Genetic Modulators**\n- AD GWAS genes (APOE, MS4A6A, PILRA, LRRK2, GRN) were upregulated in disease-associated microglia, supporting a genetic contribution to these states.\n\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nMicroglia in AD show a marked shift from homeostatic to disease-associated states (notably Micro2), characterized by upregulation of genes and pathways involved in phagocytosis, autophagy, lipid metabolism, and inflammation. These states are strongly associated with local amyloid-β and, to a lesser extent, pTau pathology. APOE and GPNMB emerge as central hubs in disease-associated microglial networks, with GPNMB validated as a protein biomarker of microglial activation in AD. The findings suggest that microglial responses to pathology are both genetically and regionally modulated, and that microglial subtypes may serve as therapeutic or biomarker targets. However, causal or temporal relationships remain associative due to the cross-sectional nature of the data.\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n**Quick Reference (≈100 words):**\nThis study identifies three main microglial subtypes in human Alzheimer’s disease cortex, with Micro2 representing a disease-associated state marked by upregulation of APOE, MS4A6A, PILRA, and GPNMB, and enriched for phagocytosis, autophagy, and inflammatory pathways. The proportion of Micro2 and perivascular macrophages increases with local amyloid-β and pTau pathology. GPNMB is validated as a robust protein marker of disease-associated microglia and is linked to lipid metabolism and autophagy. These microglial states are strongly modulated by AD genetic risk factors, notably APOE.\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications (≈150 words):**\nThis work provides a detailed map of microglial heterogeneity in human AD, highlighting the prominence of a disease-associated microglial state (Micro2) that integrates genetic risk (APOE, MS4A6A, PILRA), lipid metabolism, and inflammatory responses. The identification and validation of GPNMB as a marker of these states, and its co-expression with autophagy and lipid homeostasis genes, suggest new avenues for biomarker development and therapeutic targeting. The study’s findings align with, but also extend, prior DAM/ARM/IRM classifications from mouse models, emphasizing the complexity and partial overlap of human microglial states. The explicit association of microglial subtypes with local pathology and genetic risk supports a model in which microglial activation is both a driver and a marker of disease progression. Open questions remain regarding the functional consequences of these states, their temporal dynamics, and their potential reversibility, which will require longitudinal and experimental studies for resolution. No explicit contradictions with prior models were discussed by the authors."

Microglia are present throughout the PL, but the paper reports minimal findings regarding microglial subtypes, activation states, or disease associations in this context. The primary cellular focus is on excitatory neurons, with only brief mention of glial populations, including microglia, whose roles in PL maturation remain undetermined.\n\n---\n\n2) **Detailed Summary**\n\n<metadata>\nPage CE, Biagiotti SW, Alderman PJ, Sorrells SF. (2022). Immature excitatory neurons in the amygdala come of age during puberty. Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience, 56:101133.\nDisease focus: Typical human neurodevelopment, with reference to neuropsychiatric risk.\n</metadata>\n\n<methods>\nThis is a review and synthesis of histological, immunohistochemical, and single-cell RNA-seq studies (including Sorrells et al., 2019) on human and primate amygdala, with a focus on the paralaminar nucleus (PL). The primary tissue sources are postmortem human brains across the lifespan, with some reference to non-human primate and rodent data. The review integrates findings from immunostaining (e.g., DCX, NEUN, PSA-NCAM, BCL-2, SOX2, Ki-67), single-cell RNA-seq, and MRI-based volumetric studies.\n</methods>\n\n<findings>\n**Cell Type Proportions and Subtypes:**\nMicroglia are acknowledged as a component of the PL’s cellular milieu, but the review does not provide quantitative data on microglial abundance, subtypes, or age-related changes. The main focus is on excitatory neurons, with detailed quantification of immature (DCX+, PSA-NCAM+) and mature (NEUN+) neuronal populations, and a brief mention of astrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells.\n\n**Microglial Subtypes and Markers:**\nThe paper does not identify or characterize distinct microglial subtypes or states within the PL. There is no discussion of microglial marker gene expression (e.g., TMEM119, P2RY12, IBA1) or microglial activation profiles in the context of PL development or disease. Microglia are depicted in schematic figures (e.g., Fig. 2, Fig. 5) as part of the local environment, but without molecular or functional detail.\n\n**Functional Role and Disease Association:**\nThe review notes that glia, including microglia, are present throughout the PL and may influence neuron maturation, migration, and synaptogenesis, referencing general roles for glia in CNS development (<keyFinding priority='2'>). However, it explicitly states that \"it is currently unknown if or how glia contribute to the uniquely delayed developmental trajectory of this region\" (<confidenceLevel>low</confidenceLevel>). There is no evidence presented for microglial involvement in the protracted maturation of PL neurons, nor for microglial modulation by age, sex, or genetic factors in this context.\n\n**Spatial and Morphological Data:**\nMicroglia are illustrated as part of the PL’s cytoarchitecture, but no spatial transcriptomics, in situ hybridization, or immunostaining specific to microglia is reported. No morphological or activation state data for microglia are provided.\n\n**Modulators and Metrics:**\nNo data are presented on host or genetic factors (e.g., age, sex, APOE, GWAS variants) influencing microglial states in the PL. The review discusses sex hormone effects on neuronal maturation, but not on microglia.\n\n**Gene Regulatory Networks and Cell-Cell Communication:**\nThere is no discussion of microglial gene regulatory networks, ligand-receptor interactions, or microglia-neuron cross-talk in the PL.\n\n**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**\nThe review does not address microglial changes across developmental or disease trajectories in the PL. All temporal modelling and pseudotime analyses are focused on neuronal populations.\n\n**Genetic or Multi-omic Integration:**\nNo eQTL, GWAS, or multi-omic data linking microglial states to neurodevelopmental or neuropsychiatric risk are presented for the PL.\n\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nThe review does not provide evidence for a disease-specific role of microglia in the PL. While it discusses the potential relevance of PL maturation to neuropsychiatric disorders (e.g., ASD, MDD, early life adversity), microglia are not implicated as mediators or biomarkers in these contexts. The possible contribution of glia to PL development is acknowledged as an open question, but no mechanistic or therapeutic implications are proposed for microglia.\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n3) **Research Implications**\n\nThis review highlights a significant gap in our understanding of microglial heterogeneity and function in the human amygdala paralaminar nucleus during development. While microglia are present and likely interact with maturing neurons, the paper does not report any microglial subtypes, marker genes, or functional states specific to the PL. There is no evidence for microglial involvement in the protracted neuronal maturation that characterizes this region, nor for modulation by sex, age, or genetic risk factors. The authors explicitly note the lack of data on glial (including microglial) contributions to PL development, suggesting this as a critical area for future research. Integration of single-cell or spatial transcriptomics focused on microglia, alongside functional and morphological studies, will be necessary to determine whether microglial subtypes or activation states play a role in PL maturation or neuropsychiatric vulnerability. No conflicts with prior microglial models are discussed.\n\n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

Specific marker genes for the ASD-associated microglial state were not exhaustively listed in the main text, but the volcano plot (Fig. 2B) highlights several upregulated genes in microglia, including *PTGS2*, *H3F3B*, *CDC37*, and *SH3TC1*.

This altered microglial state is not explained by epilepsy comorbidity and is strongly associated with the clinical severity of ASD symptoms. While the functional consequences of this microglial dysregulation remain to be fully elucidated, these findings suggest that microglial activation and altered developmental programs may contribute to ASD pathophysiology and could represent potential therapeutic or biomarker targets. <keyFinding priority='1'>Microglial state is a core, clinically relevant feature of ASD cortical pathology.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n**Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**  \nThis study establishes that microglial transcriptional dysregulation is a robust and clinically relevant feature of ASD cortex, second only to upper-layer excitatory neurons in its correlation with symptom severity. The ASD-associated microglial state is characterized by upregulation of activation and developmental genes, but the study does not identify discrete microglial subtypes or provide spatial/morphological validation. Open questions include whether this state reflects persistent developmental immaturity, aberrant activation, or a unique ASD-specific phenotype, and how it interacts with neuronal pathology. The lack of overlap between microglial DEGs and top ASD genetic risk genes suggests that microglial changes may be secondary to neuronal dysfunction or reflect environmental influences. Future work should address the functional impact of these microglial changes, their temporal dynamics, and their potential as therapeutic targets. The findings are consistent with, but extend beyond, prior bulk transcriptomic studies by providing cell type–specific resolution. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

This finding challenges the prevailing view that microglial activation is a major driver of neurodegeneration in PD, at least in late-stage disease. The lack of microglial activation or emergence of DAM-like states implies that targeting microglial inflammation may be less relevant for therapeutic intervention in advanced PD, though the possibility remains for earlier disease stages.

The downregulation of TYROBP signaling and lack of inflammatory gene upregulation suggest a shift toward immunosuppression or dystrophy, rather than activation. This finding is explicitly discussed as a departure from prior models, which often relied on earlier-stage disease, different brain regions, or alternative detection methods (e.g., TSPO PET, MHC-II staining). The authors propose that microglial activation may be transient or restricted to earlier disease stages, or that methodological differences (e.g., single-nucleus vs. bulk or spatial profiling) account for the discrepancy. Future research should address microglial dynamics across disease progression, employ spatial and morphological validation, and explore whether microglial phenotypes differ in other brain regions or in prodromal/early PD. The stable expression of LRRK2 in microglia, despite its genetic association with PD, raises questions about the functional consequences of risk variants in the absence of overt activation. Overall, these results caution against assuming a universal role for microglial activation in PD pathogenesis and highlight the need for stage- and region-specific analyses.\n\n<contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>\nThe authors explicitly note that their failure to detect microglial activation or DAM-like states in advanced PD SN contrasts with previous reports of microglial activation in PD (e.g., MHC-II, ICAM-1, TSPO PET), and suggest this may reflect disease stage, region, or methodological differences.\n</contradictionFlag>"

No evidence was found for the emergence of new, disease-associated microglial subtypes in AD, in contrast to findings in mouse models and some prior human studies (<contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>: The authors note that context-dependent, disease-associated glial subpopulations were not observed for microglia in their dataset, differing from some previous reports).\n\n**Differential Gene Expression & Subtype Characterization:**  \nMicroglia and perivascular macrophages were distinguished by >300 differentially expressed genes, yielding new markers for human studies (e.g., microglia: P2RY12, C3, SPP1; perivascular macrophages: CD163, MRC1, LYVE1). These markers were validated by immunohistochemistry (<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>). Microglia exhibited a canonical homeostatic signature, with no clear evidence for DAM (disease-associated microglia) or other activation states specifically enriched in AD brains. The authors did not report further microglial subclustering or identification of distinct microglial states beyond the main homeostatic population.\n\n**Pathway Enrichment:**  \nPathway analysis of microglia-specific genes highlighted TGF-β signaling, regulation of neuron migration, and neuron death, as well as endocytic and phagocytic pathways. These signatures were consistent with known microglial functions in homeostasis and immune surveillance (<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>).\n\n**Disease Associations and GWAS Integration:**  \nA major finding is that several AD GWAS genes previously considered microglia-specific in mice (e.g., INPP5D, HLA-DRB1, CD2AP, PLCG2) are also robustly expressed in human vascular and perivascular cell types, including endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells, and fibroblasts (<keyFinding priority='1'>). This suggests a partial evolutionary transfer of AD risk gene expression from microglia in mice to vascular cells in humans (<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>). Immunostaining confirmed vascular localization of these proteins. The authors explicitly discuss this as a departure from the prevailing model that microglia are the sole mediators of these genetic risk factors in the human brain (<contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>: The authors note that the depletion of vascular cells in prior studies may have led to an overemphasis on microglia as the main GWAS gene-expressing cell type).\n\n**Modulators & Metrics:**  \nNo significant effects of APOE genotype, age, or sex on microglial proportions or transcriptional states were reported. The study did not identify microglial activation or proliferation in association with AD pathology or APOE4 status (<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>).\n\n**Spatial Analysis:**  \nImmunohistochemistry validated the spatial localization of microglia and perivascular macrophages, confirming their distinct anatomical niches. Microglia were parenchymal, while perivascular macrophages localized to vessel walls.\n\n**Aging/Disease Trajectories:**  \nNo evidence for microglial trajectory shifts or emergence of disease-associated states was found in pseudotime or clustering analyses. The authors note that their findings contrast with some mouse studies and human datasets that report DAM or other reactive microglial states in AD (<contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>: The authors explicitly state that they did not observe DAM-like subpopulations in their human data).\n\n**Gene Regulatory Networks & Cell-Cell Communication:**  \nNo specific microglial transcription factors or ligand-receptor interactions were highlighted as altered in AD. The focus was on the broader finding that AD risk genes are not exclusively microglial in humans.\n\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nMicroglia in the human brain vasculature maintain a homeostatic, surveillance phenotype in both health and AD, without clear evidence for disease-associated subtypes or activation in this dataset. The partial evolutionary shift of AD risk gene expression from microglia (in mice) to vascular cells (in humans) suggests that vascular and perivascular cells may play a more prominent role in mediating genetic risk for AD than previously appreciated. This finding may have implications for therapeutic targeting and biomarker development, as it broadens the range of cell types implicated in AD pathogenesis beyond microglia alone. However, the lack of microglial activation or DAM-like states in this study suggests that microglial contributions to AD may be more subtle or context-dependent in humans.\n</clinical>\n\n---\n\n3) **Research Implications (≈100–200 words)**\n\nThis study challenges the prevailing view that microglia are the principal mediators of AD genetic risk in the human brain, showing that many AD GWAS genes previously considered microglia-specific in mice are also expressed in human vascular and perivascular cells. This suggests an evolutionary shift in the cellular context of AD risk, with implications for understanding disease mechanisms and for the design of therapeutic strategies. The absence of DAM or other disease-associated microglial subtypes in this large, well-powered human dataset raises questions about the translatability of mouse microglial activation paradigms to human AD. Open questions include whether microglial activation states are more transient, spatially restricted, or context-dependent in humans, and how vascular-microglial interactions contribute to AD pathogenesis. The findings align with recent calls for broader cell-type and species-specific analyses in neurodegenerative disease research. The authors explicitly discuss the conflict with prior models and suggest that future studies should integrate vascular, perivascular, and microglial biology to fully capture the complexity of AD risk and progression.\n\n<contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>: The authors note that their failure to detect DAM-like microglial states in human AD brains contrasts with some previous mouse and human studies, and they attribute this in part to methodological differences and the expanded cell-type coverage of their atlas."

The high expression of LRRK2 in microglia aligns with known genetic risk and supports the relevance of microglial biology to PD pathogenesis. Future research should focus on higher-resolution profiling to determine whether distinct microglial subtypes or activation trajectories exist in PD, as well as functional studies to clarify the causal role of microglial activation in neuronal degeneration. The findings are consistent with, but do not contradict, prior models of microglial involvement in PD; rather, they extend these models by providing human cortical data and genetic context. The absence of microglial subtype resolution may reflect technical or sample size limitations, and further studies using larger cohorts or spatial transcriptomics may reveal additional heterogeneity relevant to disease mechanisms and therapeutic targeting.  \n<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>"

None of these factors were reported to modulate microglial gene expression or abundance in a disease-specific manner.\n\n- **Gene Regulatory Networks & Cell-Cell Communication:** The study’s analysis of transcriptional regulators and cell-cell communication focused on neuronal populations. No microglia-specific transcription factors or ligand-receptor interactions were highlighted as altered in schizophrenia.\n\n- **Spatial Analysis & Validation:** Morphological and spatial validation (RNAscope, immunostaining) was performed for selected neuronal genes, but not for microglial markers.
