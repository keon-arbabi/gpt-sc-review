Instead, microglia show regionally tuned, graded upregulation of immune and metabolic gene modules—especially glycolysis and MHC-II pathways—in response to amyloid and tau pathology. Microglia are the principal cell type expressing AD GWAS risk genes, with some loci (e.g., PLCG2, APOE) showing region-specific expression. The microglial response is continuous and region-dependent, not a switch to a distinct DAM state as seen in mouse models.\n</quickReference>\n\n<researchImplications>\nThis work challenges the prevailing model—derived from mouse studies—of a discrete, disease-associated microglial (DAM) state in AD, instead supporting a model of continuous, regionally modulated microglial activation in the human brain. The strong enrichment of AD risk genes in microglia, and the region-specific expression of loci such as PLCG2 and APOE, reinforce the centrality of microglia in AD pathogenesis and suggest that regional context is critical for understanding genetic risk mechanisms. The upregulation of glycolytic and immune response modules in microglia in response to amyloid pathology highlights metabolic adaptation as a potential therapeutic target. Open questions include the functional consequences of these graded microglial responses for neuronal health and whether interventions can selectively modulate microglial metabolism or immune signaling in vulnerable brain regions. The absence of a discrete DAM state in human AD is in partial conflict with some prior mouse and human studies, underscoring the need for further cross-species and spatially resolved analyses.  \n<contradictionFlag>details</contradictionFlag>  \n**Conflict:** The lack of a DAM-like microglial state in human AD contrasts with findings from mouse models and some prior human studies, suggesting species or methodological differences in microglial activation signatures.\n</researchImplications>",

(2024, Science) presents a comprehensive single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) analysis of the human prefrontal cortex (PFC) in schizophrenia, leveraging two large, independent cohorts (McLean and Mount Sinai) and profiling 468,727 nuclei from 140 individuals. The primary aim was to resolve cell type–specific transcriptomic alterations associated with schizophrenia, with a particular focus on the relative contributions of neuronal and glial populations.\n</metadata>\n\n<methods>\nThe authors employed multiplexed snRNA-seq with nuclear hashing to minimize batch effects and maximize cell recovery per individual. Cell types were annotated using a combination of unsupervised clustering (ACTIONet) and curated marker genes, with microglia identified by high CSF1R expression. Differential expression analysis was performed per cell type and cohort, followed by meta-analysis. Validation included in situ hybridization for interneuron subtypes, qPCR for selected DEGs, and CUT&Tag for transcription factor binding in neuronal nuclei.\n</methods>\n\n<findings>\nMicroglia were robustly identified as a major glial cell type in the PFC, with annotation confirmed by canonical markers (CSF1R). However, the study did not report any significant changes in the overall proportion of microglia between schizophrenia and control groups, nor was there evidence for microglial cell loss or proliferation. This finding is consistent with the lack of cell loss observed in other glial populations and suggests that microglial abundance is not altered in chronic schizophrenia. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nUnlike recent studies in neurodegenerative diseases, where microglia often display distinct disease-associated subtypes (e.g., DAM, activated microglia), this study treated microglia as a single, relatively homogeneous population. No subclustering or identification of microglial subtypes or states (such as homeostatic vs. activated) was reported. The authors did not mention the expression of activation markers (e.g., AIF1/IBA1, CD68, TMEM119) or the presence of microglial states analogous to those described in Alzheimer’s disease or multiple sclerosis. <keyFinding priority='2'>Microglia in the adult PFC do not exhibit disease-associated subtypes or activation states in schizophrenia.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nDifferential gene expression analysis revealed that microglia exhibited only a modest number of DEGs in schizophrenia compared to controls, with the majority of these being downregulated. However, the number and magnitude of DEGs in microglia were substantially lower than those observed in neuronal populations, particularly excitatory neurons, which showed the most pronounced transcriptomic alterations. The authors explicitly note that the strongest disease effects were seen in neurons, with microglia and other glial types showing only minor changes. <keyFinding priority='2'>Microglia display limited transcriptional changes in schizophrenia, with no evidence for major disease-associated subtypes or activation states.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nPathway enrichment analysis did not implicate microglia as major contributors to the neurodevelopmental or synaptic themes that dominated schizophrenia DEGs. There was no significant enrichment of immune, inflammatory, or phagocytic pathways in microglial DEGs. Instead, synaptic and neurodevelopmental pathways were primarily altered in neurons. This stands in contrast to findings in neurodegenerative disorders, where microglial activation and immune pathways are often prominent. <keyFinding priority='2'>Microglial DEGs do not converge on immune or synaptic pathways in schizophrenia, in contrast to findings in neurodegeneration.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nGenetic analyses revealed that microglial DEGs were not enriched for schizophrenia GWAS risk variants, nor were they linked to rare coding variants associated with schizophrenia. The strongest genetic associations were observed in excitatory neurons, particularly those of deep cortical layers. No evidence was found for demographic or host factors (age, sex, APOE, etc.) modulating microglial states or gene expression in this study. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nThe study identified a core module of transcription factors (TFs) associated with neuronal DEGs and schizophrenia risk, but did not implicate microglia-specific TFs or regulatory networks. No microglia-specific ligand-receptor interactions or cell-cell communication pathways were highlighted as altered in schizophrenia. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nNo spatial transcriptomics, immunostaining, or morphological validation of microglial subtypes or activation states was reported. Similarly, no evidence was presented for age- or disease-stage–dependent transitions in microglial states, nor for pseudotime trajectories involving microglia. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n\nFinally, microglial DEGs were not enriched for eQTLs or other genetic risk signals for schizophrenia, further supporting the conclusion that microglia are not a major locus of genetic risk or transcriptomic pathology in adult schizophrenia. <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>\n</findings>\n\n<clinical>\nTaken together, these findings indicate that microglia in the adult human PFC show minimal transcriptomic alteration in schizophrenia, with no evidence for disease-associated subtypes or activation states analogous to those seen in neurodegeneration.

The absence of microglial activation or immune pathway enrichment in schizophrenia suggests that microglia are not a primary locus of disease pathology in chronic adult cases. This finding is consistent with prior bulk and single-cell studies that have failed to identify robust microglial involvement in schizophrenia, but contrasts with models of neuroinflammation in other brain disorders.
