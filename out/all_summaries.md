# Summary for Green 2024

**Quick Reference (≈75 words)**  
This large-scale single-nucleus RNA-seq study of aged human prefrontal cortex identifies two distinct lipid-associated microglial subpopulations—Mic.12 (APOE+GPNMB+) and Mic.13 (APOE+GPNMB+TREM2+)—as key drivers of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. Mic.12 is strongly age-associated and may promote amyloid-β accumulation, while Mic.13, enriched in APOE ε4 carriers, mediates the effect of amyloid-β on tau pathology and is linked to cognitive decline. Both subtypes are morphologically activated and validated by spatial and in situ methods.

<methods>
Single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) was performed on dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC, BA9) tissue from 437 older ROSMAP participants, spanning the full spectrum of AD and aging. The study generated a cellular atlas of 1.65 million nuclei, identifying 95 subpopulations across all major brain cell types. Validation included bulk RNA-seq deconvolution (CelMod), single-molecule RNA FISH (smFISH), immunofluorescence, and spatial transcriptomics.

<findings>
The microglial compartment was resolved into 16 subpopulations, with particular focus on two lipid-associated states: Mic.12 (APOE+GPNMB+CPM+) and Mic.13 (APOE+GPNMB+TREM2+PTPRG+SPP1+). Both subtypes express AD risk genes and are enriched for pathways related to foam cell differentiation, cholesterol storage, and lipid metabolism. <keyFinding priority='1'>Mic.12 and Mic.13 are the microglial subpopulations most strongly associated with AD endophenotypes—amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau burden, and cognitive decline—across both discovery and replication cohorts.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Mic.12 is characterized by higher expression of endocytic vesicle regulation (PELI1/2), MHC class II genes (HLA-DRA), and is strongly associated with age (P=2.8×10⁻⁵), suggesting an age-dependent dysfunction that may impair Aβ clearance. <keyFinding priority='2'>Mic.12 abundance is positioned upstream of Aβ accumulation in causal models, indicating it may contribute to early amyloid pathology in aging brains.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Mic.13, in contrast, is not age-associated but is enriched in APOE ε4 carriers and expresses additional AD risk genes (TREM2, ADAM10). It upregulates cell junction, adhesion, and ECM organization pathways (ADAM10, TGFBR1, SMAD3, PPARG), and genes involved in negative regulation of immune processes. <keyFinding priority='1'>Causal mediation analysis places Mic.13 downstream of Aβ and upstream of tau pathology and cognitive decline, mediating 32% of the Aβ–tau association and 62% of its effect on cognitive decline via tau.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag> Mic.13 is also linked to the DAM2 microglial signature and is the primary driver of morphologically defined microglial activation (PAM stage III).

Both Mic.12 and Mic.13 were validated as distinct populations by smFISH in independent DLPFC samples, using CPM and TPRG1 as markers, respectively. Their proportions correlated with tau pathology (AT8 staining) and showed reduced compactness (less ramified, more activated morphology) compared to other microglia. Mic.12 also showed increased eccentricity. <keyFinding priority='2'>Morphological and spatial transcriptomics analyses confirmed the co-localization and activation status of these subtypes in AD brains.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

Trajectory modeling (BEYOND) revealed two divergent aging paths: a progression-to-AD (prAD) trajectory, marked by increasing Mic.12 and Mic.13 abundance, and an alternative brain aging (ABA) trajectory, where these subtypes remain low. Along the prAD trajectory, Mic.12 increases early (age-driven), followed by Mic.13 (APOE ε4-driven), then stress-responsive astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. Homeostatic microglia (e.g., Mic.2–5, CX3CR1+) decrease along both trajectories, contrasting with the disease-associated expansion of Mic.12/13. <keyFinding priority='2'>Mic.13 and stress-responsive astrocytes (Ast.10) are spatially co-localized in prAD brains, suggesting coordinated multicellular responses.</keyFinding> <confidenceLevel>medium</confidenceLevel> <contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>

<clinical>
The study proposes that Mic.12 may initiate amyloid pathology in an age-dependent manner, while Mic.13, modulated by APOE ε4, mediates the transition from amyloid to tau pathology and cognitive decline. Both subtypes represent potential therapeutic targets: Mic.12 for early intervention to prevent Aβ accumulation, and Mic.13 for halting tau propagation and neurodegeneration. Their distinct marker profiles (CPM for Mic.12, TPRG1/SPP1/TREM2 for Mic.13) may serve as biomarkers for disease stage or trajectory. The findings support a model where microglial subpopulations act in sequence, with homeostatic states giving way to lipid-associated, disease-driving phenotypes in AD.

<technical>
Findings are robust, replicated in independent bulk RNA-seq and spatial transcriptomics datasets, and validated by in situ and morphological analyses. Causal inferences are based on cross-sectional data and mediation modeling, warranting cautious interpretation regarding temporal sequence.

**Research Implications (≈100 words)**  
This study refines the classification of disease-associated microglia in human aging and AD, distinguishing two lipid-associated subtypes with distinct temporal, genetic, and functional profiles. The sequential involvement of Mic.12 (age-driven) and Mic.13 (APOE ε4-driven) in AD pathology provides actionable hypotheses for targeted intervention and biomarker development. The alignment of Mic.13 with DAM2 and activated morphologies supports its relevance to established microglial activation frameworks. Open questions remain regarding the precise mechanisms by which these subtypes influence proteinopathy and whether similar trajectories are present in other brain regions or neurodegenerative diseases. No major contradictions with prior models are noted; rather, this work extends and clarifies existing paradigms.

# Summary for Gabitto 2024

**Quick Reference (≈75 words)**  
This large-scale, multimodal atlas of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) progression in human middle temporal gyrus reveals that microglia exhibit early and robust activation, with a disease-associated microglial (DAM) subtype (micro-PVM_3) increasing in abundance as pathology advances. DAMs are marked by upregulation of inflammatory and plaque-induced genes (e.g., IL1B, CSF1R, C1QA/B, APOE), and their emergence is strongly associated with early AD pathology and APOE4 genotype enrichment. Homeostatic and lipid-associated microglia are also distinguished, but DAMs are the primary disease-associated state.

Disease focus: Alzheimer’s disease (AD)
</metadata>

<methods>
This study profiled the middle temporal gyrus (MTG) from 84 aged human donors (mean age 88), spanning the full spectrum of AD neuropathology, using single-nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq), snATAC-seq, multiome, and spatial transcriptomics (MERFISH). Donors were placed along a continuous pseudoprogression score (CPS) derived from quantitative neuropathology. Microglial subtypes were mapped to a curated BRAIN Initiative taxonomy and validated across modalities and independent datasets.
</methods>

<findings>
Microglia were comprehensively characterized, revealing both homeostatic and disease-associated subpopulations. The most salient change was a significant early increase in a disease-associated microglial (DAM) subtype, termed micro-PVM_3, as AD pathology progressed (<keyFinding priority='1'>DAMs (micro-PVM_3) increase early and robustly with AD severity, preceding exponential plaque/tangle accumulation</keyFinding>). This DAM state was replicated in independent datasets and aligns with previously described Mic.12/Mic.13 subtypes.

DAMs are defined by upregulation of inflammatory and plaque-induced genes, including IL1B, CSF1R, STAB1, NINJ1, JAK3, IRF1/7, IFI16, FCGR1A/B, FCGR2A, FCGR3B, CD74, HLA-DRB5, and complement components C1QA/B. Notably, genes induced by Aβ plaques (CSF1R, CTSC, C1QA/B, LY86, FCGR3A) are upregulated early, while others (CTSD, CTSS, LYZ, APOE) rise later in CPS (<keyFinding priority='1'>Early and late upregulation of inflammatory and plaque-induced genes in microglia, including APOE</keyFinding>). The DAM state is further characterized by increased expression of transcription factors RUNX1, IKZF1, NFATC2, and MAF, which are predicted to coregulate a network of 201 genes involved in inflammation and phagocytosis.

Homeostatic microglia (micro-PVM_2) and proliferative/lipid-associated subtypes (micro-PVM_4) were also identified. Homeostatic microglia express canonical markers (e.g., P2RY12, TPT1), while lipid-associated microglia are marked by genes involved in lipid metabolism. However, only the DAM subtype showed a strong disease association (<keyFinding priority='2'>Homeostatic and lipid-associated microglia are present but do not increase with pathology</keyFinding>).

Spatial and morphological validation was achieved through MERFISH and immunostaining, confirming the presence and localization of DAMs in affected cortical regions. The increase in DAMs was observed early in the CPS, before exponential plaque/tangle accumulation, and was consistent across MTG and prefrontal cortex datasets. The DAM increase was more pronounced in donors with the APOE4 allele, which was enriched in high-ADNC cases (<keyFinding priority='1'>APOE4 genotype is associated with higher DAM abundance</keyFinding>).

Gene regulatory network analysis using snATAC-seq revealed that the upregulated transcription factors (RUNX1, IKZF1, NFATC2, MAF) are specifically expressed in microglia and drive early DAM gene expression changes. Cell-cell communication analysis suggests that DAMs may interact with astrocytes and other glia via cytokine and complement signaling, but direct ligand-receptor pairs were not detailed.

Aging/disease trajectory modeling showed that DAMs emerge early, with their abundance plateauing as pathology accelerates. Homeostatic microglia decrease slightly, while other subtypes remain relatively stable. The DAM signature was robustly replicated in independent AD datasets, supporting its generalizability (<confidenceLevel>high</confidenceLevel>).

<contradictionFlag>none</contradictionFlag>
</findings>

<clinical>
Microglial DAMs are strongly associated with early AD pathology and may mediate inflammatory and phagocytic responses to amyloid and tau accumulation. The upregulation of APOE and complement genes in DAMs suggests a potential role in plaque clearance or propagation, but causality cannot be established from cross-sectional data. The early emergence of DAMs, particularly in APOE4 carriers, highlights their potential as biomarkers or therapeutic targets for early intervention in AD. However, whether DAM activation is protective or detrimental remains unresolved.
</clinical>

<technical>
The study used high-quality tissue and rigorous multi-modal validation, including spatial transcriptomics and chromatin accessibility, to confirm microglial subtype identities and dynamics. The DAM signature was consistent across technical platforms and replicated in external datasets, increasing confidence in the findings.

**Research Implications (≈100 words)**  
This study robustly identifies a disease-associated microglial (DAM) subtype as an early and consistent feature of AD progression, with a molecular signature aligning with established DAM/Mic.13 classifications. The strong association with APOE4 genotype and early pathology suggests DAMs may be a key mediator of neuroinflammation and plaque response. Open questions remain regarding the functional consequences of DAM activation—whether they are neuroprotective, neurotoxic, or context-dependent—and how their emergence interacts with other glial and neuronal changes. No major contradictions with prior DAM models are noted; rather, this work strengthens the consensus on DAMs as a core AD microglial phenotype.
